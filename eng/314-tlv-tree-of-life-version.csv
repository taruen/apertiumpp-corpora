GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
GEN.1.2	Now the earth was chaos and waste, darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the 
GEN.1.3	Then God said, “Let there be light!” and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	God saw that the light was good. So God distinguished the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” So there was evening and there was morning—one day. 
GEN.1.6	Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water! Let it be for separating water from water.” 
GEN.1.7	So God made the expanse and it separated the water that was below the expanse from the water that was over the expanse. And it happened so. 
GEN.1.8	God called the expanse “sky.” So there was evening and there was morning—a second day. 
GEN.1.9	Then God said, “Let the water below the sky be gathered to one place. Let the dry ground appear.” And it happened so. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry ground “land,” and the collection of the water He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the land sprout grass, green plants yielding seed, fruit trees making fruit, each according to its species with seed in it, upon the land.” And it happened so. 
GEN.1.12	The land brought forth grass, green plants yielding seed, each according to its species, and trees making fruit with the seed in it, each according to its species. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	So there was evening and there was morning—a third day. 
GEN.1.14	Then God said, “Let lights in the expanse of the sky be for separating the day from the night. They will be for signs and for seasons and for days and years. 
GEN.1.15	They will be for lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the land.” And it happened so. 
GEN.1.16	Then God made the two great lights—the greater light for dominion over the day, and the lesser light as well as the stars for dominion over the night. 
GEN.1.17	God set them in the expanse of the sky to shine on the land 
GEN.1.18	and to have dominion over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	So there was evening and there was morning—a fourth day. 
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures! Let flying creatures fly above the land across the expanse of the sky.” 
GEN.1.21	Then God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that crawls, with which the water swarms, according to their species, as well as every winged flying creature, according to their species. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	Then God blessed them by saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the water in the seas. Let the flying creatures multiply on the land.” 
GEN.1.23	So there was evening and there was morning—a fifth day. 
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the land bring forth living creatures according to their species—livestock, crawling creatures and wild animals, according to their species.” And it happened so. 
GEN.1.25	God made the wild animals according to their species, the livestock according to their species, and everything that crawls on the ground, each according to its species. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness! Let them rule over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the sky, over the livestock, over the whole earth, and over every crawling creature that crawls on the land.” 
GEN.1.27	God created humankind in His image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them. 
GEN.1.28	God blessed them and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the land, and conquer it. Rule over the fish of the sea, the flying creatures of the sky, and over every animal that crawls on the land.” 
GEN.1.29	Then God said, “I have just given you every green plant yielding seed that is on the surface of the whole land, and every tree, which has the fruit of a tree yielding seed. They are to be food for you. 
GEN.1.30	Also for every wild animal, every flying creature of the sky and every creature that crawls on the land which has life, every green plant is to be food.” And it happened so. 
GEN.1.31	So God saw everything that He made, and behold it was very good. So there was evening and there was morning—the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	So the heavens and the earth were completed along with their entire array. 
GEN.2.2	God completed—on the seventh day—His work that He made, and He ceased—on the seventh day—from all His work that He made. 
GEN.2.3	Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He ceased from all His work that God created for the purpose of preparing.
GEN.2.4	These are the genealogical records of the heavens and the earth when they were created, at the time when 
GEN.2.5	Now no shrub of the field was in the land yet, and no green plants of the field had sprouted yet. For 
GEN.2.6	But a mist came up from the land and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
GEN.2.7	Then 
GEN.2.8	Then 
GEN.2.9	Then 
GEN.2.10	A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became four riverheads. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pishon, the one that winds around the whole land of the Havilah, where there is gold. 
GEN.2.12	The gold of that land is good—bdellium and lapis lazuli stones are also there. 
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is Gihon—it winds around the whole land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river is Tigris—it runs east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 
GEN.2.15	Then 
GEN.2.16	Then 
GEN.2.17	But of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil you must not eat. For when you eat from it, you most assuredly will die! 
GEN.2.18	Then 
GEN.2.19	 had formed from the ground every animal of the field and every flying creature of the sky, so He brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called them—each living creature—that was its name. 
GEN.2.20	So the man gave names to all of the livestock, and to the flying creatures of the sky, and to all the animals of the field; but for the man He did not find a well-matched helper for him. 
GEN.2.21	 caused a deep sleep to fall on the man and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. 
GEN.2.22	 built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman. Then He brought her to the man. 
GEN.2.23	Then the man said, “This one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh from my flesh. This one is called woman, for from man was taken this one.” 
GEN.2.24	This is why a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife; and they become one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	Now both of them were naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	But the serpent was shrewder than any animal of the field that 
GEN.3.2	The woman said to the serpent, “Of the fruit of the trees, we may eat. 
GEN.3.3	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat of it and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” 
GEN.3.4	The serpent said to the woman, “You most assuredly won’t die! 
GEN.3.5	For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 
GEN.3.6	Now the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a thing of lust for the eyes, and that the tree was desirable for imparting wisdom. So she took of its fruit and she ate. She also gave to her husband who was with her and he ate. 
GEN.3.7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made for themselves loin-coverings. 
GEN.3.8	And they heard the sound of 
GEN.3.9	Then 
GEN.3.10	Then he said, “Your sound—I heard it in the garden and I was afraid. Because I am naked, I hid myself.” 
GEN.3.11	Then He said, “Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the Tree from which I commanded you not to eat?” 
GEN.3.12	Then the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me—she gave me of the Tree, and I ate.” 
GEN.3.13	 said to the woman, “What did you do?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me and I ate.” 
GEN.3.14	 said to the serpent, “Because you did this, Cursed are you above all the livestock and above every animal of the field. On your belly will you go, and dust will you eat all the days of your life. 
GEN.3.15	I will put animosity between you and the woman— between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head, and you will crush his heel. 
GEN.3.16	To the woman He said, “I will greatly increase your pain from conception to labor. In pain will you give birth to children. Your desire will be toward your husband, yet he must rule over you.” 
GEN.3.17	Then to the man He said, “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate of the tree which I commanded you, saying, ‘You must not eat of it’: Cursed is the ground because of you— with pain will you eat of it all the days of your life. 
GEN.3.18	Thorns and thistles will sprout for you. You will eat the plants of the field, 
GEN.3.19	By the sweat of your brow will you eat food, until you return to the ground, since from it were you taken. For you are dust, and to dust will you return.” 
GEN.3.20	Now Adam named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living. 
GEN.3.21	 made Adam and his wife tunics of skin and He clothed them. 
GEN.3.22	Then 
GEN.3.23	 sent him away from the Garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he had been taken. 
GEN.3.24	And He expelled the man; and at the east of the Garden of Eden He had 
GEN.4.1	Now the man had relations with Eve his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “I produced a man with 
GEN.4.2	Then she gave birth again, to his brother Abel. Abel became a shepherd of flocks while Cain became a worker of the ground. 
GEN.4.3	So it happened after some time that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to 
GEN.4.4	while Abel—he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. Now 
GEN.4.5	but upon Cain and his offering He did not look favorably. Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell. 
GEN.4.6	Then 
GEN.4.7	If you do well, it will lift. But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the doorway. Its desire is for you, but you must master it.” 
GEN.4.8	Cain spoke to Abel his brother. While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. 
GEN.4.9	Then 
GEN.4.10	Then He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground. 
GEN.4.11	So now, cursed are you from the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 
GEN.4.12	As often as you work the ground, it will not yield its crops to you again. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” 
GEN.4.13	Cain said to 
GEN.4.14	Since You expelled me today from the face of the ground and I must be hidden from Your presence, then I will be a restless wanderer on the earth—anyone who finds me will kill me!” 
GEN.4.15	But 
GEN.4.16	Then Cain left 
GEN.4.17	Cain was intimate with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. And he was building a city, and he named the city after the name of his son, Enoch. 
GEN.4.18	And to Enoch was born Irad. Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	Now Lamech took for himself two wives. The name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal—he was the pioneer of tent dwellers with livestock. 
GEN.4.21	His brother’s name was Jubal—he was the pioneer of all who skillfully handle stringed instruments and wind instruments. 
GEN.4.22	Now Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of bronze and iron tools; Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah. 
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice! Lamech’s wives: Listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a boy for bruising me. 
GEN.4.24	If Cain is to be avenged seven times, then Lamech—77 times!” 
GEN.4.25	Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and she named him Seth, “For God has appointed me another seed in place of Abel—since Cain killed him.” 
GEN.4.26	To Seth, also was born a son. He named him Enosh. Then people began to call on 
GEN.5.1	This is the Book of the Genealogies of Adam: When God created Adam, in the likeness of God He made him. 
GEN.5.2	Male and female He created them, and He blessed them and called their name “Adam” when He created them. 
GEN.5.3	Adam lived 130 years, then fathered a son in his likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	Then the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years, and He fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	So all Adam’s days that he lived were 930 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.6	Seth lived 105 years, then fathered Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	Seth lived 807 years after he fathered Enosh, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	So all Seth’s days were 912 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.9	Enosh lived 90 years, then fathered Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Enosh lived 815 years after he fathered Kenan, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	So all of Enosh’s days were 905 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.12	Kenan lived 70 years, then fathered Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	Kenan lived 840 years after he fathered Mahalalel, he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	So all of Kenan’s days were 910 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.15	Mahalalel lived 65 years, then fathered Jared. 
GEN.5.16	Mahalalel lived 830 years after he fathered Jared, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	So all of Mahalalel’s days were 895 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.18	Jared lived 162 years, then fathered Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	Jared lived 800 years after he fathered Enoch, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	So all of Jared’s days were 962 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.21	Enoch lived 65 years, then fathered Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	Now Enoch walked with God continually for 300 years after he fathered Methuselah, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	So all of Enoch’s days were 365 years. 
GEN.5.24	And Enoch continually walked with God—then he was not there, because God took him. 
GEN.5.25	Methuselah lived 187 years and fathered Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	And Methuselah lived 782 years after he fathered Lamech, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	So all of Methuselah’s days were 969 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.28	Lamech lived 182 years and he fathered a son. 
GEN.5.29	And he named him Noah saying, “This one will comfort us from our work and from the pain of our hands because of the ground which 
GEN.5.30	Lamech lived 595 years after he fathered Noah, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	So all of Lamech’s days were 777 years, and then he died. 
GEN.5.32	And Noah was 500 years old when he fathered Shem, Ham and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	Now when humankind began to multiply on the face of the ground and daughters were born to them, 
GEN.6.2	then the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were good and they took for themselves wives, any they chose. 
GEN.6.3	Then 
GEN.6.4	The 
GEN.6.5	Then 
GEN.6.6	So 
GEN.6.7	So 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favor in 
GEN.6.9	These are the genealogies of Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He was blameless among his generation. Noah continually walked with God. 
GEN.6.10	Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. 
GEN.6.11	Now the earth was ruined before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	God saw the earth, and behold it was ruined because all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
GEN.6.13	Then God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh is coming before Me, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. Behold, I am about to bring ruin upon them along with the land. 
GEN.6.14	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood. You shall make the ark with compartments and smear pitch on it, both inside and out. 
GEN.6.15	Now this is how you shall make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. 
GEN.6.16	You shall make a roof for the ark, and you shall finish it to within a cubit from the top. You shall put the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third stories. 
GEN.6.17	Now I am about to bring the flood—water upon the land—to destroy all flesh in which is the spirit of life from under the sky. Everything that is on the land will perish. 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish My covenant with you. So you shall come into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.6.19	Also of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of everything—male and female—into the ark to keep alive with you. 
GEN.6.20	Of the flying creatures according to their kind, of the livestock according to their kind, of all the crawling creatures of the ground according to their kind—two of everything will come to you to keep them alive. 
GEN.6.21	As for you: take for yourself every kind of edible food and gather it to yourself. It will be food for you and for them.” 
GEN.6.22	So Noah did according to all that God commanded him; he did so exactly.
GEN.7.1	Then 
GEN.7.2	Of every clean animal you shall take with you seven of each kind, male and female; and of the animals which themselves are not clean two, male and female; 
GEN.7.3	also of the flying creatures of the sky seven of every kind, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of the whole land. 
GEN.7.4	For in seven more days, I am going to make it rain upon the land forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe out all existence that I made from the face of the ground. 
GEN.7.5	So Noah did all just as 
GEN.7.6	Now Noah was 600 years old when the flood came—water upon the land. 
GEN.7.7	So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, entered the ark because of the floodwaters. 
GEN.7.8	Of the clean animals and unclean animals, the flying creatures and everything that crawls on the ground, 
GEN.7.9	two by two they came to Noah, into the ark, male and female, just as God commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	After the seven days, the floodwaters were upon the land. 
GEN.7.11	In the six-hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this day, all the water sources of the great deep burst open, and the windows of the sky were opened. 
GEN.7.12	Then there was rain upon the land 40 days and 40 nights. 
GEN.7.13	On that same day Noah, along with Noah’s sons Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s wife and the three wives of Noah’s sons with them, entered the ark, 
GEN.7.14	they and every animal according to its kind, and all the livestock according to its kind, and every crawling creature that crawls on the land according to its kind, and every flying creature according to its kind, every bird, every winged creature. 
GEN.7.15	So to Noah and into the ark they went by twos—all flesh in which was the spirit of life. 
GEN.7.16	Those that came, male and female of all flesh, came just as God commanded him. Then 
GEN.7.17	The flood was forty days upon the land, and the waters increased and lifted the ark, so that it rose above the land. 
GEN.7.18	The waters overpowered and became very mighty over the land, and the ark drifted on the surface of the water. 
GEN.7.19	The waters completely overpowered the land so that all the high mountains beneath the entire sky were covered. 
GEN.7.20	The waters rose 15 cubits higher, as the mountains were covered. 
GEN.7.21	All flesh perished—those that crawl on the land, the flying creatures, livestock, wild animals, all creatures that swarm upon the land, and all humankind. 
GEN.7.22	Everything that had the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils—everything on dry land—died. 
GEN.7.23	So He wiped out all existence that was upon the surface of the ground, everything from people to livestock, to crawling creatures, and to flying creatures of the sky. They were wiped out off the land. Only Noah and those with him in the ark survived. 
GEN.7.24	The waters overpowered the land for 150 days.
GEN.8.1	Then God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. So God caused a wind to pass over the land and the water subsided. 
GEN.8.2	Also the sources of the deep and the windows of the skies were closed up, and the rain from the sky was held back. 
GEN.8.3	The waters kept receding gradually from upon the land and the waters decreased by the end of 150 days. 
GEN.8.4	The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	The waters went on decreasing until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. 
GEN.8.6	It was at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made. 
GEN.8.7	Then he sent out a raven and it kept going back and forth until the waters were drying up from the land. 
GEN.8.8	Then he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot. She returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole land. He stretched out his hand and he took her, and brought her to him into the ark. 
GEN.8.10	So he waited yet another seven days and again he sent the dove out from the ark. 
GEN.8.11	The dove came to him at evening, and surprisingly—a freshly plucked olive leaf was in its mouth. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the land. 
GEN.8.12	After he waited seven more days, he sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again. 
GEN.8.13	It was in his six-hundred-and first year—in the first month, on the first day of the month—that the waters had dried up from the land. Then Noah removed the cover of the ark and he looked, and behold, the surface of the ground had dried up. 
GEN.8.14	By the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the land was dry. 
GEN.8.15	Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	“Come out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Every animal that is with you of all flesh, including the flying creatures, livestock and every crawling creature that crawls on the land, bring out with you, and let them swarm in the land and be fruitful and multiply upon the land.” 
GEN.8.18	So Noah came out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives. 
GEN.8.19	Every animal—every crawling creature, every flying creature, everything that crawls upon the land—came out from the ark in their families. 
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to 
GEN.8.21	When 
GEN.8.22	While all the days of the land remain, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.”
GEN.9.1	God blessed Noah and his sons, and He said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the land. 
GEN.9.2	The fear and terror of you will be on every wild animal, and on every flying creature of the sky, with everything that crawls on the ground and with all the fish of the sea—into your hand they are given. 
GEN.9.3	Every crawling thing that is alive will be food for you, as are the green plants—I have now given you everything. 
GEN.9.4	Only flesh with its life—that is, its blood—you must not eat! 
GEN.9.5	Surely your lifeblood will I avenge. From every animal and from every person will I avenge it. From every person’s brother will I avenge that person’s life. 
GEN.9.6	The one who sheds human blood, by a human will his blood be shed, for in God’s image He made humanity. 
GEN.9.7	But as for you, be fruitful and multiply! Flourish in the land and multiply in it.” 
GEN.9.8	Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
GEN.9.9	“Now I, behold, I am about to establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you, 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you, including the flying creatures, the livestock, and every wild animal with you, of all that is coming out of the ark—every animal of the earth. 
GEN.9.11	I will confirm My covenant with you—never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again will there be a flood to ruin the land.” 
GEN.9.12	Then God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you for all future generations. 
GEN.9.13	My rainbow do I place in the cloud, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the land. 
GEN.9.14	Whenever I bring clouds over the land and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember My covenant that is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
GEN.9.16	When the rainbow is in the cloud, I will look at it, to remember the perpetual covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the land.” 
GEN.9.17	Then God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have confirmed between Me and all flesh that is on the land.”
GEN.9.18	Noah’s sons who came out from the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth, and Ham was the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These three were Noah’s sons, and from these the whole earth dispersed. 
GEN.9.20	Then Noah, a man of the soil, was first to plant a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	He drank some of the wine, got drunk, and was uncovered in his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Then Ham, Canaan’s father, saw his father’s private parts and told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	So Shem and Japheth took the cloak and laid it over both their shoulders and walked backwards and with it covered their father’s private parts. But their faces were turned away, so they did not see their father’s private parts. 
GEN.9.24	When Noah woke up from his wine, he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 
GEN.9.25	So he said, “Cursed is Canaan: the lowest slave will he be to his brothers.” 
GEN.9.26	He also said, “Blessed be 
GEN.9.27	May God enlarge Japheth, may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave.” 
GEN.9.28	Now Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	So all Noah’s days were 950 years. Then he died.
GEN.10.1	And these are the genealogical records of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood. 
GEN.10.2	Japheth’s sons were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	Gomer’s sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	Javan’s sons were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittites and Dodanites. 
GEN.10.5	From these the coastlands of the nations spread out in their lands, each one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 
GEN.10.6	Ham’s sons were Cush, Mizraim, Put and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	Cush’s sons were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And Raamah’s sons were Sheba, and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	Now Cush fathered Nimrod. He started to become mighty in the land. 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before 
GEN.10.10	The beginning of his kingdom included Babel, Erech, Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
GEN.10.11	From that land he went out to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rechovot-ir, Calah 
GEN.10.12	and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah—it is the great city. 
GEN.10.13	Mizraim fathered the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites, 
GEN.10.14	the Pathrusites, the Casluhites—from whom came the Philistines—and the Caphtorites. 
GEN.10.15	Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn, Heth, 
GEN.10.16	the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite, 
GEN.10.17	the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadite, the Zemarite and the Hamathite—and afterwards, the Canaanite families were scattered. 
GEN.10.19	Now the Canaanite border was from Zidon, as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are Ham’s sons according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, in their nations. 
GEN.10.21	Sons were also born to Shem, who was Japheth’s older brother and the father of all the sons of Eber. 
GEN.10.22	Shem’s sons were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	Aram’s sons were Uz, Hul, Gether and Mash. 
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber. 
GEN.10.25	Two sons were born to Eber. The name of the first was Peleg—because in his days the land was divided—and his brother’s name was Joktan. 
GEN.10.26	Joktan fathered Elmodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All of these are Joktan’s sons. 
GEN.10.30	Their dwelling place was from Mesha till you come toward Sephar, the eastern hill country. 
GEN.10.31	These are Shem’s sons, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations. 
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah according to their genealogies in their nations, and from these the nations were dispersed on the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	Now the entire earth had the same language with the same vocabulary. 
GEN.11.2	When they traveled eastward, they found a valley-plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 
GEN.11.3	They said to one another, “Come! Let’s make bricks and bake them until they’re hard.” So they used bricks for stone, and tar for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	Then they said, “Come! Let’s build ourselves a city, with a tower whose top reaches into heaven. So let’s make a name for ourselves, or else we will be scattered over the face of the whole land.” 
GEN.11.5	Then 
GEN.11.6	 said, “Look, the people are one and all of them have the same language. So this is what they have begun to do. Now, nothing they plan to do will be impossible. 
GEN.11.7	Come! Let Us go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand each other’s language.” 
GEN.11.8	So 
GEN.11.9	This is why it is named Babel, because 
GEN.11.10	These are the genealogical records of Shem: Shem was 100 years old when he fathered Arpachshad—two years after the flood. 
GEN.11.11	Shem lived 500 years after he fathered Arpachshad, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.12	Arpachshad lived 35 years when he fathered Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	Arpachshad lived 403 years after he fathered Shelah, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.14	Shelah lived 30 years and he fathered Eber. 
GEN.11.15	Shelah lived 403 years after he fathered Eber, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.16	Eber lived 34 years and he fathered Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	Eber lived 430 years after he fathered Peleg, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.18	Peleg lived 30 years and he fathered Reu. 
GEN.11.19	Peleg lived 209 years after he fathered Reu, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.20	Reu lived 32 years and he fathered Serug. 
GEN.11.21	Reu lived 207 years after he fathered Serug, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.22	Serug lived 30 years and fathered Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	Serug lived 200 years after he fathered Nahor, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.24	Nahor lived 27 years and he fathered Terah. 
GEN.11.25	Nahor lived 119 years after he fathered Terah, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.26	Terah lived 70 years when he fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran. 
GEN.11.27	These are Terah’s genealogies: Terah fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran. Haran fathered Lot. 
GEN.11.28	Haran died before Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah—the daughter of Haran, father of Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Sarai was barren; she did not have a child. 
GEN.11.31	Terah took Abram his son and Lot, Haran’s son, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife, and he took them out of Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there. 
GEN.11.32	Terah’s days were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Then 
GEN.12.2	My heart’s desire is to make you into a great nation, to bless you, to make your name great so that you may be a blessing. 
GEN.12.3	My desire is to bless those who bless you, but whoever curses you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed. 
GEN.12.4	So Abram went, just as 
GEN.12.5	Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the people that they acquired in Haran, and they left to go to the land of Canaan, and they entered the land of Canaan. 
GEN.12.6	Abram passed through the land as far as the place of Shechem, as far as Moreh’s big tree. (The Canaanites were in the land then.) 
GEN.12.7	Then 
GEN.12.8	From there he moved to the mountain to the east of Beth-El and erected his tent (with Beth-El to the west and Ai to the east). There he built an altar to 
GEN.12.9	So Abram kept on journeying southward. 
GEN.12.10	Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to live as an outsider there, because the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.12.11	Just as he was about to enter Egypt he said to Sarai his wife, “Look, please, I know that you are an attractive woman. 
GEN.12.12	So when the Egyptians see you they’ll say, ‘This is his wife.’ And they’ll kill me; but you, they’ll let live. 
GEN.12.13	Please say that you are my sister, so that I’ll be treated well for your sake, and my life will be spared because of you.” 
GEN.12.14	When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians did see that the woman was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	Indeed, Pharaoh’s officials saw her and they raved about her to Pharaoh. Then the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.12.16	But Abram was treated well for her sake, and he got sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male and female slaves, female donkeys and camels. 
GEN.12.17	But 
GEN.12.18	So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What’s this that you did to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she is your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take—and go!” 
GEN.12.20	Then Pharaoh instructed men concerning him, and they expelled him, with his wife, and everything that belonged to him.
GEN.13.1	So Abram went up from Egypt—he and his wife and everything that belonged to him, and Lot with him—to the Negev. 
GEN.13.2	Now Abram was very rich in livestock, silver and gold. 
GEN.13.3	He proceeded by stages from the Negev as far as Beth-El—to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-El and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	to the place of the altar that he had made there at first, and there Abram called on the Name of 
GEN.13.5	Now Lot, who was going with Abram, also had sheep and cattle and tents, 
GEN.13.6	so that the land could not support them living together, because their possessions were many, and they were not able to stay together. 
GEN.13.7	So there was a quarrel between the shepherds of Abram’s livestock and the shepherds of Lot’s livestock. (Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land then.) 
GEN.13.8	So Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between me and you, or between my shepherds and yours, since we are relatives. 
GEN.13.9	Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If to the left, then I’ll go to the right, and if to the right, then I’ll go to the left.” 
GEN.13.10	Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the whole area surrounding the Jordan was well watered in its entirety (before 
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose for himself the whole area surrounding the Jordan. Lot journeyed to the east, and they separated from each other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the valley. And he moved his tent from place to place near Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	But the people of Sodom were evil—very great sinners against 
GEN.13.14	After Lot separated himself from him, 
GEN.13.15	For all the land that you are looking at, I will give to you and to your seed forever. 
GEN.13.16	I will make your seed like the dust of the earth so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then your seed could also be counted. 
GEN.13.17	Get up! Walk about the land through its length and width—for I will give it to you.” 
GEN.13.18	So Abram moved his tent from place to place, and came and dwelt by Mamre’s large trees, which are in Hebron, and there built an altar to 
GEN.14.1	Now it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (this is Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	All of these kings joined forces in the Valley of the Siddim (this is the Salt Sea). 
GEN.14.4	For 12 years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came with the kings who were with him, and they defeated the Rephaim in Ashterot-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiryataim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-Paran, which is beside the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	Then they came again to En-mishpat (this is Kadesh), and they subdued all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who live in Hazazon-tamar. 
GEN.14.8	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (this is Zoar) went out and lined themselves up for battle with them in the Valley of the Siddim, 
GEN.14.9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar: four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the Valley of the Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, and those who remained fled to the hills. 
GEN.14.11	So they took all of Sodom and Gomorrah’s possessions and their food and left. 
GEN.14.12	They also took Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions, and they left (as he was living in Sodom). 
GEN.14.13	Then a survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was dwelling by the large trees belonging to Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eschol and the brother of Aner—they were Abram’s allies. 
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he rallied his trained men, those born in his household, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
GEN.14.15	Then he divided his servants against them at night, and he defeated them and pursued them as far as Hovah, which is north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	He brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot and his possessions, as well as the women and the other people. 
GEN.14.17	Now after he returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (this is the King’s Valley). 
GEN.14.18	Then 
GEN.14.19	He blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram by 
GEN.14.20	and blessed be 
GEN.14.21	Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people—the possessions take for yourself.” 
GEN.14.22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I raise my hand in oath to 
GEN.14.23	Not a thread or even a sandal strap of all that is yours will I take, so you will not say, ‘I’ve made Abram rich!’ 
GEN.14.24	I claim nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me—Aner, Eschol, and Mamre—let them take their share.”
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of 
GEN.15.2	But Abram said, “My Lord 
GEN.15.3	Then Abram said, “Look! You have given me no seed, so a house-born servant is my heir.” 
GEN.15.4	Then behold, the word of 
GEN.15.5	He took him outside and said, “Look up now, at the sky, and count the stars—if you are able to count them.” Then He said to him, “So shall your seed be.” 
GEN.15.6	Then he believed in 
GEN.15.7	Then He said to him, “I am 
GEN.15.8	So he said, “My Lord 
GEN.15.9	Then He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old young cow, a three year old she-goat, a three year old ram, a turtle-dove and a young bird.” 
GEN.15.10	So he brought all these to Him and cut them in half, and put each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. 
GEN.15.11	Then birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
GEN.15.12	When the sun was about to set and a deep sleep fell on Abram, behold, terror of great darkness was falling upon him! 
GEN.15.13	Then He said to Abram, “Know for certain that your seed will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will be enslaved and oppressed 400 years. 
GEN.15.14	But I am going to judge the nation that they will serve. Afterward they will go out with many possessions. 
GEN.15.15	But you, you will come to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	Then in the fourth generation they will return here—for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” 
GEN.15.17	When the sun set and it became dark, behold, there was a smoking oven and a fiery torch that passed between these pieces. 
GEN.15.18	On that day 
GEN.15.19	the Kenite, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Raphaites, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not borne him children. But she had an Egyptian slave-girl—her name was Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, 
GEN.16.3	So Sarai, Abram’s wife, took her slave-girl Hagar the Egyptian—after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan—and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. 
GEN.16.4	Then he went to Hagar and she became pregnant. When she saw that she was pregnant, in her eyes her mistress was belittled. 
GEN.16.5	So Sarai said to Abram, “The wrong done to me is because of you! I myself placed my slave-girl in your embrace. Now that she saw that she became pregnant, so in her eyes I am belittled. May 
GEN.16.6	Abram said to Sarai, “Look! Your slave-girl is in your hand. Do to her what is good in your eyes.” So Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her presence. 
GEN.16.7	Then the angel of 
GEN.16.8	He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave-girl, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.” 
GEN.16.9	The angel of 
GEN.16.10	Then the angel of 
GEN.16.11	Then the angel of 
GEN.16.12	He will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him, and away from all his brothers will he dwell. 
GEN.16.13	So she called 
GEN.16.14	That is why the well is named, the Well of the Living One Who Sees Me. (Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.) 
GEN.16.15	Then Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for Abram.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was 99 years old, 
GEN.17.2	My heart’s desire is to make My covenant between Me and you, and then I will multiply you exceedingly much.” 
GEN.17.3	Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying, 
GEN.17.4	“For My part, because My covenant is with you, you will be the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.5	No longer will your name be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, because I make you the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.6	Yes, I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings will come forth from you. 
GEN.17.7	Yes, I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, in order to be your God and your seed’s God after you. 
GEN.17.8	I will give to you and to your seed after you the land where you are an outsider —the whole land of Canaan—as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.” 
GEN.17.9	God also said to Abraham, “As for you, My covenant you must keep, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. 
GEN.17.10	This is My covenant that you must keep between Me and you and your seed after you: all your males must be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	You must be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and this will become a sign of the covenant between Me and you. 
GEN.17.12	Also your eight-day-olds must be circumcised, every male, throughout your generations, including a house-born slave or a slave bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed. 
GEN.17.13	Your house-born slave and your purchased slave must surely be circumcised. So My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	But the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin—that person will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.” 
GEN.17.15	God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her by the name Sarai. Rather, Sarah is her name. 
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son from her. I will bless her and she will give rise to nations. Kings of the peoples will come from her.” 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to his heart, “Will a son be born to a 100-year-old man? Or will Sarah—who is 90 years old—give birth?” 
GEN.17.18	So Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live before you!” 
GEN.17.19	But God said, “On the contrary, Sarah your wife will bear you a son and you must name him Isaac. So I will confirm My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you. See, I have blessed him and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him very very much. He will father twelve princes and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But My covenant will I establish with Isaac whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	When He finished speaking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
GEN.17.23	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all of his house-born slaves and all his purchased slaves—every male among the men of Abraham’s house—and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on this very same day, just as God had spoken with him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, 
GEN.17.25	and his son Ishmael was 13 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.26	On this very same day Abraham and Ishmael his son were circumcised. 
GEN.17.27	Also all the men of his house, house-born slaves and slaves purchased from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	Then 
GEN.18.2	When he lifted up his eyes to see, suddenly, three men were standing right by him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed down to the ground. 
GEN.18.3	Then he said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant. 
GEN.18.4	Please let a little water be brought so you can wash your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree. 
GEN.18.5	And let me bring a bit of bread so that you can refresh yourselves—then you can pass on—since you have passed by your servant. They said, “Do just as you have said.” 
GEN.18.6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick! Knead three measures of fine flour and prepare bread loaves!” 
GEN.18.7	Then to the herd Abraham ran and took a young ox, tender and good, and he gave it to the servant, who prepared it quickly. 
GEN.18.8	Then he took butter and milk and the young ox that he had prepared and set it before them. While he was standing by them under the tree, they ate. 
GEN.18.9	Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” “There, in the tent,” he said. 
GEN.18.10	Then He said, “I will most surely return to you in about a year’s time, surprisingly, Sarah your wife will have a son.” Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind Him. 
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years—Sarah had stopped having the way of women. 
GEN.18.12	So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I’ve grown decrepit, can I have desire—and my lord so old?” 
GEN.18.13	Then 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too difficult for 
GEN.18.15	Sarah denied it saying, “I didn’t laugh!” For she was afraid. But He said, “No—for you did laugh.”
GEN.18.16	Then the men got up from there and looked down over Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to send them off, 
GEN.18.17	when 
GEN.18.18	seeing that Abraham will most certainly become a great and mighty nation and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed? 
GEN.18.19	For I have made myself known to him so that he will command his sons and his household after him to keep the way of 
GEN.18.20	Then 
GEN.18.21	I want to go down now, and see if they deserve destruction, as its outcry has come to Me. And if not, I will know.” 
GEN.18.22	Then the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham was still standing before 
GEN.18.23	Abraham drew near and said, “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of fifty righteous who are in it? 
GEN.18.25	Far be it from You to do such a thing—to cause the righteous to die with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked share the same fate! Far be it from You! Shall the Judge of the whole world not exercise justice?” 
GEN.18.26	Then 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham answered and said, “Look, pray, I have decided to speak to my Lord, though I am dust and ashes. 
GEN.18.28	Suppose the fifty righteous people are lacking five. Will You destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” 
GEN.18.29	So he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Perhaps forty will be found there?” And He said, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty.” 
GEN.18.30	Then he said, “Please, let my Lord not be angry, so I may speak. Perhaps thirty will be found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” 
GEN.18.31	Then he said, “Look, pray, I have decided to speak to my Lord: Perhaps twenty will be found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.” 
GEN.18.32	Then he said, “Please, let not my Lord be angry, so I may speak once more. Perhaps ten will be found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.” 
GEN.18.33	Now when He had finished speaking to Abraham, 
GEN.19.1	Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, while Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
GEN.19.2	Then he said, “Here, please my lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house, spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can get up early and go on your way.” But they said, “No. We will spend the night in the open plaza.” 
GEN.19.3	But he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and they came into his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked 
GEN.19.4	They had not yet lain down when the men of the city (the men of Sodom) surrounded the house—from youth to elderly, all the people without exception. 
GEN.19.5	And they called out to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have relations with them!” 
GEN.19.6	But Lot went out to them at the doorway and shut the door behind him, 
GEN.19.7	and said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act wickedly. 
GEN.19.8	Look, I have two daughters who haven’t been intimate with a man. Please let me bring them out to you—do to them whatever is good in your eyes! However, do nothing to these men—since they have come under the protection of my roof.” 
GEN.19.9	“Get out of the way!” they said, and they said, “This one came as an outsider and dares to judge! Now we’ll treat you worse than them!” So they strongly pressed against the man, Lot, and moved in close to break the door down. 
GEN.19.10	But the men reached out their hands, brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	Then they struck the men at the doorway of the house with blindness—from youth to elderly—so that they gave up trying to find the doorway. 
GEN.19.12	Then the men said to Lot, “Who else related to you is still here? A son-in-law, your sons and your daughters, whoever else is related to you in the city—bring them out of the place! 
GEN.19.13	For we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before 
GEN.19.14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were going to marry his daughters, “Get up!” he said, “Get out of this place! For 
GEN.19.15	So when morning dawned the angels rushed Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be swept away with the city’s iniquity!” 
GEN.19.16	But he hesitated. So the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand and his two daughters’ hands—because of 
GEN.19.17	When they brought them outside, one said, “Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stop anywhere in the surrounding area! Escape to the hills, or else you’ll be swept away!” 
GEN.19.18	But Lot said to them, “No, my Lord, please! 
GEN.19.19	Look, please, your servant has found favor in Your eyes and You have magnified Your merciful loyalty, which You have shown me by letting me live. But I can’t escape to the hill country—for the disaster will overtake me and I’ll die! 
GEN.19.20	Look, please, this city is close enough to flee there, and it’s little. Please let me escape there. Isn’t it small? And let me live!” 
GEN.19.21	So He said to him, “Behold, I will grant your request concerning this matter too—not to demolish the city of which you have spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Hurry! Flee to safety there, because I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” (This is why the town is named Zoar.) 
GEN.19.23	The moment the sun rose upon the land, Lot entered Zoar, 
GEN.19.24	and 
GEN.19.25	So He demolished these cities and the whole surrounding area, all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground. 
GEN.19.26	But his wife looked behind him and she turned into a pillar of salt. 
GEN.19.27	Now Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood before 
GEN.19.28	and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward the entire land of the surrounding area, and saw, behold, the smoke of the land ascended like smoke from a furnace. 
GEN.19.29	So it was, as God destroyed the cities of the surrounding area, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the upheaval, when He demolished the cities where Lot had dwelt. 
GEN.19.30	Then Lot went up from Zoar and dwelled on the mountain, his two daughters with him, because he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. So he lived in a cave—he and his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come to us as is the custom of the whole land. 
GEN.19.32	Come on! Let’s make our father drink wine so that we can lie with him and keep the seed from our father alive. 
GEN.19.33	So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn came and lay down with her father. Yet he did not know that she lay down and got up. 
GEN.19.34	On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “See! I slept with my father last night. Let’s make him drink wine tonight as well. Come on! Sleep with him so that we’ll keep the seed from our father alive.” 
GEN.19.35	So they made their father drink wine that night as well, and the younger got up and lay down with him and he did not know that she lay down and got up. 
GEN.19.36	So Lot’s two daughters become pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	Then the firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab: he is the ancestor of the Moabites to this day. 
GEN.19.38	The younger also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi: he is the ancestor of the sons of Ammon to this day.
GEN.20.1	Then Abraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was dwelling as an outsider in Gerar, 
GEN.20.2	Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for and took Sarah. 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, “Behold, you are as good as dead, because of the woman whom you have taken—since she is a married woman.” 
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not come near her. So he said, “My Lord, will You slay a nation, even though innocent? 
GEN.20.5	Didn’t he say to me, ‘She’s my sister’? And she herself even said, ‘He’s my brother.’ I did this with integrity of my heart and guiltlessness of my hands.” 
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I myself knew that you did this with integrity of your heart, so I, yes I Myself prevented you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her. 
GEN.20.7	So now, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet. And let him pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will surely die—you and all who are yours.” 
GEN.20.8	Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants and spoke all these words in their ears—and the men were very frightened. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called to Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us, and how have I sinned against you, that you brought great sin upon me and my kingdom? You’ve done to me things that should not be done!” 
GEN.20.10	Abimelech also said to Abraham, “What motivated you to do this thing?” 
GEN.20.11	Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘There is certainly no fear of God in this place, so they’ll kill me, because of my wife.’ 
GEN.20.12	And besides, she really is my sister. She’s my father’s daughter, though not my mother’s daughter. Then she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	So when God made me wander away from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your loyalty that you must show me: in every place we go, say of me, ‘He is my brother.’” 
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech took sheep, cattle, male slaves and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him. 
GEN.20.15	Then Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Dwell wherever it pleases you.” 
GEN.20.16	At the same time he said to Sarah, “Look, I’ve given a thousand shekels to your brother. Look, it is compensation for everything that happened—so to everyone with you, you are vindicated.” 
GEN.20.17	Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his female slaves so that they could bear children. 
GEN.20.18	For 
GEN.21.1	Then 
GEN.21.2	So Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time that God had told him. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham named his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore for him—Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	Then Abraham circumcised Isaac, his eight-day-old son, just as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac his son was born to him. 
GEN.21.6	So Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me! Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” 
GEN.21.7	She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham, ‘Sarah has nursed children’? For I have given birth to a son in his old age!” 
GEN.21.8	The child grew and was weaned—Abraham made a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned. 
GEN.21.9	But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian whom she had born to Abraham—making fun. 
GEN.21.10	So she said to Abraham, “Drive out this female slave and her son, for the son of this female slave will not be an heir with my son—with Isaac.” 
GEN.21.11	Now the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s eyes on account of his son. 
GEN.21.12	But God said to Abraham, “Do not be displeased about the boy and your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For through Isaac shall your seed be called. 
GEN.21.13	Yet I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, because he is your seed.” 
GEN.21.14	So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. She went and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 
GEN.21.15	When the water from the skin was finished, she abandoned the child under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went and sat herself down opposite, about a bowshot away, for she had said, “I can’t bear to see the child dying!” So she sat down opposite and lifted up her voice and wept. 
GEN.21.17	Then God heard the boy’s voice and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and He said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, because God has heard the boy’s voice where he is. 
GEN.21.18	Get up! Lift the boy up, and hold on to him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled the water skin, and gave the boy a drink. 
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy and he grew. He dwelled in the wilderness and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	He dwelled in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	Now it came about at that same time that Abimelech—with Phicol the commander of his army---said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. 
GEN.21.23	So now, make a pledge to me here, by God, that you will not violate your word with me or with my descendants or with my offspring. As I have shown loyalty to you, show the same to me, and to the land in which you have lived as an outsider.” 
GEN.21.24	Abraham said, “I make a pledge.” 
GEN.21.25	Now Abraham had rebuked Abimelech because of the well of water that Abimelech’s servants had seized. 
GEN.21.26	So Abimelech said, “I don’t know who did this thing. Nor did you tell me, nor did I hear about it until today.” 
GEN.21.27	Then Abraham took a flock of sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham set seven young ewe-lambs apart from the flock of sheep by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe-lambs that you’ve set by themselves mean?” 
GEN.21.30	He said, “You are to accept the seven ewe-lambs from my hand, so that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	That is why that place is named Beer-sheba, because there both of them made a pledge, 
GEN.21.32	and they made a covenant in Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech got up, with Phicol the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Then he planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba and called there on the Name of 
GEN.21.34	He lived as an outsider in the land of the Philistines for many days.
GEN.22.1	Now it was after these things that God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham.” “
GEN.22.2	Then He said, “Take your son, your only son whom you love —Isaac—and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains about which I will tell you.” 
GEN.22.3	So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split wood for the burnt offering, and got up and went to the place about which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from a distance. 
GEN.22.5	Abraham said to his young men, “Sit yourselves down here with the donkey. As for me and the young man, we’ll go over there, worship and return to you.” 
GEN.22.6	Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on Isaac his son. In his hand he took the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. 
GEN.22.7	Then Isaac said to Abraham his father, “My father?” Then he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Look. Here’s the fire and the wood. But where’s the lamb for a burnt offering?” 
GEN.22.8	Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself a lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” The two of them walked on together. 
GEN.22.9	Then they came to the place about which God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there, laid out the wood, bound up Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
GEN.22.10	Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 
GEN.22.11	But the angel of 
GEN.22.12	Then He said, “Do not reach out your hand against the young man—do nothing to him at all. For now I know that you are one who fears God—you did not withhold your son, your only son, from Me.” 
GEN.22.13	Then Abraham lifted up his eyes and behold, there was a ram, just caught in the thick bushes by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 
GEN.22.14	Abraham named that place, 
GEN.22.15	The angel of 
GEN.22.16	and said, “By myself I swear—it is a declaration of 
GEN.22.17	I will richly bless you and bountifully multiply your seed like the stars of heaven, and like the sand that is on the seashore, and your seed will possess the gate of his enemies. 
GEN.22.18	In your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed—because you obeyed My voice.” 
GEN.22.19	Then Abraham returned to his young men and they got up and went together to Beer-sheba. Then Abraham dwelled in Beer- sheba. 
GEN.22.20	Now it was after these things that it was told to Abraham, “Look, Milcah has also borne sons to Nahor your brother: 
GEN.22.21	Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Yidlaph and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Then Bethuel fathered Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 
GEN.22.24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Now Sarah’s life was 127 years—the years of Sarah’s life. 
GEN.23.2	Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. 
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham rose from before his dead one and spoke to the sons of Heth saying, 
GEN.23.4	“I am an outsider and a sojourner among you. Give me a gravesite among you so that I may bury my dead from before my presence.” 
GEN.23.5	The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.6	“Listen to us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our graves. None among us will withhold his grave from you, to bury your dead one.” 
GEN.23.7	Then Abraham got up and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth, 
GEN.23.8	and spoke with them saying, “If you are of a mind to let me bury my dead from before my presence, listen to me. Plead with Ephron son of Zophar on my behalf, 
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him, that is at the end of his field. At the full price let him give it to me in your midst for a gravesite.” 
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, all those who enter the gate of his city, saying, 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, listen to me. The field—I hereby give it to you. Also the cave that is in it—I hereby give it to you. In the eyes of the sons of my people, I hereby give it to you. Bury your dead one.” 
GEN.23.12	Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land, 
GEN.23.13	and spoke to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land saying, “But if only you would please listen to me. I hereby give the price of the field. Accept it from me that I may bury my dead one there.” 
GEN.23.14	So Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me. A land worth 400 shekels of silver—what is that between me and you? Bury your dead one.” 
GEN.23.16	Abraham heard Ephron. So Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver that he had spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth—400 shekels of silver at the merchant’s rate. 
GEN.23.17	Now Ephron’s field that is in Machpelah next to Mamre—the field and the cave that is in it, and all the trees that are in the field in all its surrounding territory—was handed over 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham as a purchased possession in the eyes of the sons of Heth, before all those who enter the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	Afterward, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah next to Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	So the field and the cave that was in it were handed over to Abraham as a gravesite from the sons of Heth.
GEN.24.1	Now Abraham was old, advanced in years, and 
GEN.24.2	Then Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household who managed everything that belonged to him, “Now put your hand under my thigh, 
GEN.24.3	so that I may make you take an oath by 
GEN.24.4	On the contrary, to my land and to my relatives you must go and get a wife for my son Isaac. 
GEN.24.5	But the servant said to him, “Suppose the woman were unwilling to follow after me to this land? Should I then have your son go back to the land you came from? 
GEN.24.6	Abraham said to him, “See to it that you don’t return my son there. 
GEN.24.7	, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from my native land and who spoke to me and made a pledge to me saying, ‘To your seed I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you and you will take a wife for my son from there. 
GEN.24.8	If the woman is not willing to follow after you, then you will be free from this oath of mine. Nevertheless, you must not return my son there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and he made a pledge to him concerning this matter. 
GEN.24.10	Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and left with all the best of his master’s things in his hand. Then he arose and went to Aram-Naharaim, to Nahor’s city. 
GEN.24.11	Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time for the going out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	“
GEN.24.13	Look, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please tip your jar so that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink—and I’ll also water your camels’—let her be the one You have appointed for your servant Isaac. So by this I’ll know that You have shown graciousness to my master.” 
GEN.24.15	Now before he had finished speaking, behold there was Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother) going out with her jar on her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	Now the young woman was very good looking, a girl of marriageable age, and she was a virgin. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. 
GEN.24.17	Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me sip a little water from your jar.” 
GEN.24.18	So she said, “Drink, my lord,” and she quickly lowered her jar onto her hand and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	Now when she finished giving him a drink, she said, “I’ll also draw water for your camels until they’ve finished drinking.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly poured out her jug into the trough, ran back to the well to draw water, and drew water for all his camels, 
GEN.24.21	while the man continued to pay close attention to her, keeping silent in order to know whether or not 
GEN.24.22	Now after the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a nose ring of gold weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets on her hands weighing ten shekels of gold. 
GEN.24.23	“Whose daughter are you?” he said. “Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” 
GEN.24.24	She said to him, “I’m the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	She also said to him, “There’s both straw and plenty of feed with us, as well as room to spend the night.” 
GEN.24.26	Then the man bowed down and worshipped 
GEN.24.27	and he said, “Blessed be 
GEN.24.28	Then the young woman ran and told her mother’s house these things. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother and his name was Laban, and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring. 
GEN.24.30	As soon as he saw the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister saying, “Thus the man said to me,” he went to the man. There he was, standing by the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	So he said, “Come in, blessed of 
GEN.24.32	So the man came to the house and he unloaded the camels. Straw and feed were given to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
GEN.24.33	Food was placed before him to eat, but he said, “I won’t eat until I’ve stated my business.” So he said, “Speak.” 
GEN.24.34	“I am Abraham’s servant,” he said. 
GEN.24.35	 has blessed my master very much so that he has become great, and He has given to him flocks of sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male slaves and female slaves, camels and donkeys. 
GEN.24.36	Now Sarah, my master’s wife, gave birth to a son for my master after she was old, and He gave him everything he owns. 
GEN.24.37	Then my master made me take an oath, saying, ‘You must not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I’m dwelling.’ 
GEN.24.38	Instead you must go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	But I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman won’t come back with me?’ 
GEN.24.40	So he said to me, ‘
GEN.24.41	Then you’ll be free from my oath—if you come to my family and if they don’t give her to you—then you’ll be free from my oath.’ 
GEN.24.42	So I came today to the spring and I said, ‘
GEN.24.43	look, I’m standing by the spring of water. So let it be that the unmarried girl who is going out to draw water, to whom I’ll say, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jug,” 
GEN.24.44	and she’ll say to me, “You drink, and I’ll also draw water for your camels”—let her be the woman whom 
GEN.24.45	I had not yet finished speaking to my heart, and behold there was Rebekah going out—her jug was on her shoulder and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	And she quickly lowered her jug off of her and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. 
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ Then I placed the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands. 
GEN.24.48	I bowed down and worshipped 
GEN.24.49	So now, if you’re really going to show loyalty and truth to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me and I’ll turn to the right or to the left.” 
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and they said, “The matter proceeds from 
GEN.24.51	Rebekah is before you. Take her and go, and let her become a wife for our master’s son, just as 
GEN.24.52	Now when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground to 
GEN.24.53	Then the servant brought out articles of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brothers and to her mother. 
GEN.24.54	Then they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me off to my master.” 
GEN.24.55	But her brother with her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days—or ten. Afterwards she may go.” 
GEN.24.56	But he said to them, “Don’t delay me, since 
GEN.24.57	So they said, “We’ll call the young woman and let’s ask her opinion.” 
GEN.24.58	Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.” 
GEN.24.59	So they sent Rebekah their sister off with her nanny, and Abraham’s servant and his men, 
GEN.24.60	and they blessed Rebekah and said to her: “Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your seed possess the gate of those who hate him.” 
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah got up, with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed after the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed. 
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac had come from visiting Beer-lahai-roi and was living in the land of the Negev. 
GEN.24.63	Isaac went out to meditate strolling in the field at dusk. Then he lifted up his eyes and saw, behold, camels were coming. 
GEN.24.64	Rebekah also lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac. Then she fell off her camel. 
GEN.24.65	Then she said to the servant, “Who is that man there who is walking in the field—to meet us?” The servant said, “He is my master.” So she took the veil and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	Then the servant recounted to Isaac all the things he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, took Rebekah and she became his wife—and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after the loss of his mother.
GEN.25.1	Now Abraham took another wife—her name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s sons were Asshurim, Letushim and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All of these were Keturah’s sons. 
GEN.25.5	Now Abraham gave everything that he had to Isaac, 
GEN.25.6	but to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham had given gifts and sent them away from his son Isaac while he was still living, eastward to the land of the east. 
GEN.25.7	Now these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life that he lived: 175 years. 
GEN.25.8	So Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old and satisfied. Then he was gathered to his peoples. 
GEN.25.9	Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, next to Mamre, 
GEN.25.10	the field that Abraham bought from the sons of Heth. There Abraham is buried along with Sarah his wife. 
GEN.25.11	After Abraham’s death, God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac lived near Beer-lahai-roi. 
GEN.25.12	Now these are the genealogies of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian slave-girl, bore to Abraham. 
GEN.25.13	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according to their descendants: Ishmael’s firstborn, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedem. 
GEN.25.16	These are Ishmael’s sons and these are their names, by their unwalled and walled settlements, twelve princes according to their clans. 
GEN.25.17	These are the years of Ishmael’s life: 137 years. He breathed his last, died and was gathered to his peoples. 
GEN.25.18	Then they dwelled from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria. Over against all his brothers he fell.
GEN.25.19	Now these are the genealogies of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham fathered Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	Isaac was 40 years old when he took for himself Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. 
GEN.25.21	Isaac prayed to 
GEN.25.22	But the children struggled with one another inside her, and she said, “If it’s like this, why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of 
GEN.25.23	 said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from your body will be separated. One people will be stronger than the other people, but the older will serve the younger.” 
GEN.25.24	When her time came to give birth, indeed there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	Now the first came out reddish, all of him was like a fur coat, and they named him Esau. 
GEN.25.26	Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding onto Esau’s heel—so he was named Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when he fathered them. 
GEN.25.27	When the boys grew up, Esau became a man knowledgeable in hunting, an outdoorsman, while Jacob was a mild man, remaining in tents. 
GEN.25.28	Now Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
GEN.25.29	Now Jacob cooked a stew. When Esau came in from the field, he was exhausted, 
GEN.25.30	so Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me some of this really red stuff, because I’m exhausted”—that is why he is called Edom. 
GEN.25.31	So Jacob said, “Sell your birthright to me today.” 
GEN.25.32	Esau said, “Look, I’m about to die. Of whatever use is this to me—a birthright?” 
GEN.25.33	Jacob said, “Make a pledge to me now.” So he made a pledge to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	Now there was a famine in the land—aside from the previous famine that happened in Abraham’s days. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines, to Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	Then 
GEN.26.3	Live as an outsider in this land and I will be with you and bless you—for to you and to your seed I give all these lands—and I will confirm my pledge that I swore to Abraham your father. 
GEN.26.4	I will multiply your seed like the stars of the sky and I will give your seed all these lands. And in your seed all the nations of the earth will continually be blessed, 
GEN.26.5	because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My charge, My 
GEN.26.6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	Now the men of the place asked about his wife. So he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “my wife”—“or else the men of the place would kill me on account of Rebekah, because she’s good looking.” 
GEN.26.8	Now after he had been there for a long time, King Abimelech of the Philistines peered down through the window and saw, behold, Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. 
GEN.26.9	So Abimelech called Isaac and said, “So in fact she’s your wife! Now how could you say, ‘She’s my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Or else I might die because of her.’” 
GEN.26.10	Then Abimelech said, “What is it that you’ve done to us? One of the people could have easily slept with your wife and you would’ve brought guilt on us.” 
GEN.26.11	So Abimelech commanded all the people saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely die!”
GEN.26.12	Then Isaac sowed in that land and in that year reaped a hundredfold. 
GEN.26.13	and the man became great and continued to become greater until he became very great. 
GEN.26.14	He acquired livestock of sheep and livestock of cattle, and numerous servants. Then the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	All the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham the Philistines stopped up and filled with dirt. 
GEN.26.16	So Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much more powerful than us.” 
GEN.26.17	So Isaac departed from there, camped in the Valley of Gerar and dwelled there. 
GEN.26.18	Then Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham—the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham’s death. He gave them the same names that his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of living water there. 
GEN.26.20	But the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s shepherds saying, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Quarrel, because they quarreled with him. 
GEN.26.21	Then he dug another well and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Accusation. 
GEN.26.22	Then he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he named it Wide Spaces and said, “Because now 
GEN.26.23	He went up from there to Beer-sheba. 
GEN.26.24	 appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed for the sake of Abraham my servant.” 
GEN.26.25	So he built an altar there and called on the Name of 
GEN.26.26	Now Abimelech went to him from Gerar along with Achuzzat his friend and Phicol the commander of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and sent me away from you?” 
GEN.26.28	They said, “We’ve clearly seen that 
GEN.26.29	that you will do us no harm, just as we haven’t touched you and just as we did nothing to you but good, and sent you away in 
GEN.26.30	Then he made a feast for them and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Then they got up early in the morning and made a pledge, each to his brother. Then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in 
GEN.26.32	Now it happened that on that day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well that they dug, and said to him, “We’ve found water.” 
GEN.26.33	So he called it Pledge. That is why the city’s name is Beer-sheba to this day. 
GEN.26.34	When Esau was 40 years old, he took as wife Judith the daughter of Be-eri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	But they caused a bitterness of spirit for Isaac and Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	Now it was when Isaac grew old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” he said to him. 
GEN.27.2	“Look, I’m old,” he said. “I don’t know the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	So now, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt me some game. 
GEN.27.4	Then prepare me a delicious meal that I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.” 
GEN.27.5	Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac was speaking to Esau his son. So while Esau went to the field to hunt game to bring in, 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to Jacob her son, “Look, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau saying, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me some game and prepare me a delicious meal that I may eat and bless you in 
GEN.27.8	So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I am commanding you. 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock and bring me two good young goats from there, so that I may prepare them as a delicious meal for your father—that he’ll love. 
GEN.27.10	Then you’ll bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.” 
GEN.27.11	But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I’m a smooth man. 
GEN.27.12	Perhaps my father will touch me, and he’ll take me for a mocker, and I’ll bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.” 
GEN.27.13	Then his mother said to him, “Let your curse fall on me, my son. Just listen to me, and go, get them for me.” 
GEN.27.14	So he went and got them, and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a delicious meal that his father would love. 
GEN.27.15	Rebekah also took her elder son Esau’s favorite clothes that were with her in the house, and she put them on her younger son Jacob, 
GEN.27.16	along with the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the hairless part of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	She put the delicious meal and the bread that she had prepared in the hand of Jacob her son. 
GEN.27.18	Then he came to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “I’m here. Who are you, my son?” 
GEN.27.19	Then Jacob said to his father, “I’m your firstborn, Esau. I’ve done just what you said to me. Sit up, please, and eat some of my wild game so that your soul may bless me.” 
GEN.27.20	Then Isaac said to his son, “How in the world were you able to find it so quickly, my son?” He said, “Because 
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can feel you my son—whether or not you really are my son Esau.” 
GEN.27.22	So Jacob came closer to his father Isaac, and he felt him. Then he said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice but the hands are Esau’s hands.” 
GEN.27.23	He did not recognize him because his hands were like the hairy hands of his brother Esau. So he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	But he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” So he said, “I am.” 
GEN.27.25	Then he said, “Bring it to me and I’ll eat some of my son’s wild game, so that my soul may bless you.” So he brought it to him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come closer and kiss me my son.” 
GEN.27.27	So he came closer and kissed him. When he smelled the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that 
GEN.27.28	May God give you— from the dew of the sky and from the fatness of the land— an abundance of grain and new wine. 
GEN.27.29	May peoples serve you and may nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers. May your mother’s sons bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and may those who bless you be blessed.” 
GEN.27.30	No sooner had Isaac finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had just gone out from his father Isaac’s presence, than Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	Then he also prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father, and he said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat of his son’s wild game that your soul may bless me.” 
GEN.27.32	His father Isaac said, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your first-born, Esau.” 
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled with intense trembling and said, “Who was it then that hunted wild game and brought it to me? I ate it all just before you came and I blessed him—and yes, he will be blessed.” 
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard his father’s words, he shouted with an intensely bitter groan. Then he said to his father, “Bless me, me too, my father!” 
GEN.27.35	Then he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” 
GEN.27.36	He said, “Is this why he was named Jacob—since he’s tricked me twice already? My birthright he’s taken. Look! Now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he said, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?” 
GEN.27.37	Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I’ve made him master over you, and all your brothers I’ve given to him as servants. I’ve provided him with grain and new wine. What then can I do for you, my son?” 
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Do you just have one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. 
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father said to him, “Behold, away from the land’s fatness shall your dwelling be, away from the dew of the sky above. 
GEN.27.40	By your sword shall you live, and your brother shall you serve. But when you tear yourself loose, you will tear his yoke off your neck.” 
GEN.27.41	So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, “Let the time for mourning my father draw near, so that I can kill my brother Jacob!” 
GEN.27.42	Now to Rebekah was reported the words of Esau her elder son. So she sent and called for Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself about you with the thought of killing you. 
GEN.27.43	So now my son, listen to my voice. Get up—flee to Laban my brother in Haran! 
GEN.27.44	Then stay with him a few days, until your brother’s rage subsides, 
GEN.27.45	until your brother’s rage turns away from you and he forgets what you’ve done to him. Then I’ll send for you and get you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” 
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these women, from the daughters of the land what is life to me?”
GEN.28.1	So Isaac called for Jacob, blessed him, commanded him and said to him, “Don’t take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Get up, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and take for yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. 
GEN.28.3	Now may 
GEN.28.4	And may he give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you that you may take possession of the land of your sojourn, which God gave to Abraham.” 
GEN.28.5	Then Isaac sent Jacob away and he went toward Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 
GEN.28.6	Now Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob when he sent him to Paddan-aram to take for himself a wife from there, when he blessed him and commanded him saying, “Don’t take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.” 
GEN.28.7	Jacob listened to his father Isaac and to his mother and went toward Paddan-aram. 
GEN.28.8	Then Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were contemptible in his father Isaac’s eyes. 
GEN.28.9	So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, Nebaioth’s sister for his wife, besides his other wives.
GEN.28.10	Then Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	He happened upon a certain place and spent the night there, for the sun had set. So he took one of the stones from the place and put it by his head and lay down in that place. 
GEN.28.12	He dreamed: All of a sudden, there was a stairway set up on the earth and its top reaching to the heavens—and behold, angels of God going up and down on it! 
GEN.28.13	Surprisingly, 
GEN.28.14	Your seed will be as the dust of the land, and you will burst forth to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed—and in your seed. 
GEN.28.15	Behold, I am with you, and I will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land, for I will not forsake you until I have done what I promised you.” 
GEN.28.16	Jacob woke up from his sleep and said, “Undoubtedly, 
GEN.28.17	So he was afraid and said, “How fearsome this place is! This is none other than the House of God—this must be the gate of heaven!” 
GEN.28.18	Early in the morning Jacob got up and took the stone, which he had placed by his head, and set it up as a memorial stone and poured oil on top of it. 
GEN.28.19	He called the name of that place Beth-El (though originally the city’s name was Luz). 
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this way that I am going, and provide me food to eat and clothes to wear, 
GEN.28.21	and I return in 
GEN.28.22	So this stone which I set up as a memorial stone will become God’s House, and of everything You provide me I will definitely give a tenth of it to You.”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob lifted up his feet and went to the land of the peoples of the east. 
GEN.29.2	When he looked, suddenly, there was a well in the field, and there were three herds of sheep resting by it. (For from that well they would water the flocks. The stone on the mouth of the well was large. 
GEN.29.3	When all the herds gathered there, they would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the flocks, and put the stone back to its place over the mouth of the well.) 
GEN.29.4	Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Haran,” they said. 
GEN.29.5	So he said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s son?” They said, “We know.” 
GEN.29.6	He said to them, “Is he well?” “Well,” they said. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock.” 
GEN.29.7	He said, “Since it’s still the middle of the day, it’s not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the flock and let them go and graze.” 
GEN.29.8	But they said, “We can’t, not until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well—then we water the flock.” 
GEN.29.9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock that belonged to her father (for she was a shepherdess). 
GEN.29.10	Now when Jacob saw Rachel (the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother), Jacob stepped forward and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban, his mother’s brother. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. 
GEN.29.12	Then Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was Rebekah’s son. So she ran and told her father. 
GEN.29.13	Now when Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, hugged and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Then he told Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	Laban said to him, “Surely you are my own bone and flesh.” And he stayed with him for a month. 
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you, my relative, serve me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?” 
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said, “Let me serve you for seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.” 
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than I give her to another man! Stay with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, yet in his eyes it was like a few days, because of his love for her. 
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are completed, so I may go to her.” 
GEN.29.22	So Laban gathered all the men of the place and he prepared a feast. 
GEN.29.23	When it was evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him, and he went to her. 
GEN.29.24	Laban also gave her Zilpah his female servant to his daughter Leah as a female servant. 
GEN.29.25	So when it was morning, behold there she was, Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you’ve done to me? Wasn’t it for Rachel that I worked with you? So why have you deceived me?” 
GEN.29.26	But Laban said, “It’s not done so in our place—to give the younger before the first-born. 
GEN.29.27	Complete the bridal week for this one. Then we’ll also give you this other—for work that you’ll do with me—another seven years more.” 
GEN.29.28	So Jacob did; he also completed this one’s bridal week. Then he gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. 
GEN.29.29	Laban also gave his daughter Rachel his female servant Bilhah, to be a servant for her. 
GEN.29.30	Jacob also went to Rachel and indeed loved Rachel more than Leah. So he served with him for yet another seven years. 
GEN.29.31	Now 
GEN.29.32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him Reuben because she said, “For 
GEN.29.33	Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and said, “For 
GEN.29.34	Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will join himself to me because I’ve given birth to three sons for him.” For this reason he was named Levi. 
GEN.29.35	Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son and said, “This time I praise 
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she bore no children for Jacob, Rachel was jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me sons—if there are none, I’ll die!” 
GEN.30.2	But Jacob became furious with Rachel and said, “Am I, instead of God, the one who withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” 
GEN.30.3	So she said, “Here’s my maid-servant Bilhah. Go to her and let her give birth on my knees, so that from her I may also build a family.” 
GEN.30.4	Then she gave her maid-servant Bilhah to him for a wife, and Jacob went to her. 
GEN.30.5	Bilhah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.6	So Rachel said, “God has judged my cause and also heard my voice—and given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan. 
GEN.30.7	Then Rachel’s female servant became pregnant again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.8	So Rachel said, “I’ve surely wrestled greatly with my sister — also I’ve won.” So she named him Naphtali. 
GEN.30.9	Now Leah saw that she stopped having children, so she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Then Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.11	Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad. 
GEN.30.12	Then Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.13	Leah said, “How happy am I, for daughters have called me happy.” So she named him Asher. 
GEN.30.14	Now during the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and he brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.15	But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took my husband away? You’d also take away my son’s mandrakes?” So Rachel said, “That being so, let him lie with you tonight, in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.16	So when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and she said, “You must come to me. For I’ve actually hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that very night. 
GEN.30.17	Moreover, God heard Leah, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.18	Leah said, “God gave me my reward because I gave my female servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	Leah said, “God has presented me a good gift. This time my husband will honor me for I’ve borne six sons for him.” So she named him Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	Afterwards she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. 
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	Then she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. So she said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 
GEN.30.24	She named him Joseph saying, “May 
GEN.30.25	Now it was after Rachel gave birth to Joseph that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away so that I can go to my place and to my land. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I’ve served you, and let me go. For you yourself know my labor—that I’ve served you.” 
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “If I’ve found favor in your eyes—I’ve looked for good omens, and 
GEN.30.28	Moreover he said, “Name your own price and I’ll pay it.” 
GEN.30.29	Then he said to him, “You yourself know how I’ve served you and how your livestock fared with me. 
GEN.30.30	For you had very little before I came, and it has been busting at the seams in abundance. So 
GEN.30.31	Then he said, “What can I pay you?” Jacob said, “You don’t need to pay me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will shepherd your flock again and watch it: 
GEN.30.32	let me pass through your flock today, removing every colorfully spotted lamb from there and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep as well as the colorfully spotted among the goats—and that will be my salary. 
GEN.30.33	So tomorrow my honesty will testify on my behalf when you come to check on my salary you agreed to. Every one that isn’t colorfully spotted among the goats or dark-colored among the sheep with me, it is stolen.” 
GEN.30.34	So Laban said, “All right! May it be according to your word.” 
GEN.30.35	On that day he removed the colorfully striped and colorful billy goats as well as all the colorfully spotted goats—everyone with white on it—and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and he put them in the hand of his sons. 
GEN.30.36	Then he put a three-day’s journey between them and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding Laban’s remaining flocks. 
GEN.30.37	But Jacob took fresh white poplar, almond, and plane tree branches, peeled away white stripped sections on them, exposing the white of the branches. 
GEN.30.38	Then he set the branches he had peeled in front of the flocks in the drinking troughs and watering channels where the flocks come to drink. Since they were in heat when they came to drink, 
GEN.30.39	the flocks mated near the branches, and the flocks gave birth to striped, spotted and colorful ones. 
GEN.30.40	Now Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped ones as well as all the dark-colored ones among Laban’s flocks. Then he set aside the herds for himself and did not put them with Laban’s flocks. 
GEN.30.41	Whenever the strong flocks mated, Jacob put the branches in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flocks, to have them mate near the branches. 
GEN.30.42	But when the flocks were sickly, he did not put the branches down—so the sickly ones became Laban’s and the stronger ones became Jacob’s. 
GEN.30.43	And the man grew exceedingly prosperous and had numerous flocks, along with female and male servants, camels and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	Now Jacob heard the words Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything that belongs to our father, and from what belongs to our father he has made all these riches.” 
GEN.31.2	Then Jacob saw Laban’s face, and he noticed that his expression wasn’t the same as it was just a day or two before. 
GEN.31.3	Then 
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent and called for Rachel and Leah to come to the field, to his flock. 
GEN.31.5	He said to them, “I can see by your father’s face that his expression isn’t the same as it was just a day or two ago. But the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	Now you yourselves know that I’ve served your father with all my strength. 
GEN.31.7	Yet your father has fooled around with me and has changed my salary ten times—but God hasn’t allowed him to harm me. 
GEN.31.8	If he would say, ‘the spotted ones will be your salary,’ then the flocks would give birth to spotted ones. Or if he would say, ‘the striped ones will be your salary,’ then all the flocks would give birth to striped ones. 
GEN.31.9	So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me. 
GEN.31.10	Now it happened when the flocks were in heat that I lifted up my eyes and saw, in a dream, behold, the males going up to the flocks were striped, spotted and speckled. 
GEN.31.11	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘
GEN.31.12	He said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see that all the males going up to the flocks are striped, spotted and speckled. For I have seen everything Laban has done to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Beth-El where you anointed a memorial stone, where you made a vow to Me. Get up now and leave this land, and return to the land of your relatives.’” 
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel answered along with Leah and they said to him, “Is there still a portion and inheritance for us in our father’s house? 
GEN.31.15	Aren’t we considered foreigners to him? For he has sold us and has also completely used up our bridal price. 
GEN.31.16	For all the riches that God has taken away from our father is for us and for our children. So now, everything God said to you, do it!” 
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob got up and put his children and wives on camels. 
GEN.31.18	He drove away all his livestock and all his possessions that he had acquired—the livestock in his possession that he acquired in Paddan-aram—to go to his father Isaac, to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	But while Laban went to shear his flocks, Rachel stole the idols that belonged to her father, 
GEN.31.20	while Jacob stole the heart from Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing. 
GEN.31.21	He himself fled with everything that belonged to him, and he got up and crossed the River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.22	When Laban was told on the third day after Jacob had fled, 
GEN.31.23	he took his relatives with him and pursued him a seven days’ journey. Then he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Watch yourself—lest you say anything to Jacob, good or bad.” 
GEN.31.25	So Laban caught up to Jacob. (Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, so Laban and his brothers pitched their tents in the hill country of Gilead as well). 
GEN.31.26	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you’ve stolen my heart and have driven my daughters away like captives of the sword? 
GEN.31.27	Why did you secretly flee away, and steal from me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and with songs, with tambourines and with lyres? 
GEN.31.28	And you didn’t even let me kiss my sons and daughters! “Now, you’ve behaved foolishly. 
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to do evil with you, but yesterday the God of your fathers spoke to me, saying, ‘Watch yourself—lest you say anything to Jacob, good or bad.’ 
GEN.31.30	So now, when you up and left because you really missed your father’s house, why did you steal my gods?” 
GEN.31.31	In response, Jacob said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought, ‘Suppose you snatch your daughters away from me.’ 
GEN.31.32	Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In front of our relatives, identify whatever is yours that is with me, and take it back.” (But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.) 
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he found nothing. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	(Now Rachel had taken the idols, put them in the camel’s saddlebag and sat on them.) So Laban felt around the entire tent but did not find them. 
GEN.31.35	She said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for I am having the way of women.” So he searched but did not find the idols. 
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob got angry and argued with Laban. Jacob answered and said to Laban, “What’s my crime? What’s my sin that you’ve hotly pursued me? 
GEN.31.37	For you’ve felt through all my things. What did you find? Any of your household things? Put them here, in front of my relatives and yours—so they can decide between the two of us. 
GEN.31.38	These past twenty years I’ve been with you, your ewes and female goats have never miscarried, and I’ve never eaten the rams of your flock. 
GEN.31.39	I didn’t bring you animals torn by wild beasts. I myself would bear the loss. You would require it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
GEN.31.40	I was consumed by heat during the day, consumed by frost during the night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	This is how it’s been for me twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks—and you changed my salary ten times! 
GEN.31.42	Had I not had the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, you would have sent me away empty-handed now. But God saw my misery and the toil of my hands and last night He became the Judge.” 
GEN.31.43	In response Laban said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks. Everything you see is mine. But what can I do for these, my daughters, today, or for their sons to whom they’ve given birth? 
GEN.31.44	So now, come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.” 
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar, 
GEN.31.46	and Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they took the stones and made a pile. Then they ate there on the pile. 
GEN.31.47	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha and Jacob called it Gal-ed. 
GEN.31.48	And Laban said, “This pile is a witness between me and you today.” That is why its name is Gal-ed, 
GEN.31.49	or Mizpah, for he said, “Let 
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters, though no one is with us, look! God is the witness between you and me.” 
GEN.31.51	Laban said further to Jacob, “Behold, this pile, and this pillar which I’ve set up between you and me: 
GEN.31.52	this pile serves as a witness, that I won’t pass by this pillar to go to you, and that you won’t pass by this pile and this pillar to go to me—with evil intent. 
GEN.31.53	May the God of Abraham and the gods of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us.” Jacob also made an oath by the fear of his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and he invited his relatives to eat bread. So they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.
GEN.32.1	Early in the morning Laban got up, kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and returned to his place. 
GEN.32.2	While Jacob left on his way, the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.3	Then Jacob said when he saw them, “This is God’s camp,” and he named that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.4	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 
GEN.32.5	He also commanded them saying, “This is what you should say to my lord, to Esau: ‘This is what your servant Jacob said: I’ve been staying with Laban, and have lingered until now. 
GEN.32.6	Now I’ve come to possess oxen and donkeys, flocks, male servants and female servants. I sent word to tell my lord, in order to find favor in your eyes.’” 
GEN.32.7	The messengers returned to Jacob saying, “We went to your brother, to Esau, and he’s also coming out to meet you—and 400 men with him.” 
GEN.32.8	So Jacob became extremely afraid and distressed. He divided the people with him, along with the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, 
GEN.32.9	for he thought, “If Esau comes to one camp and strikes it, the camp that’s left will escape.” 
GEN.32.10	Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, 
GEN.32.11	I am unworthy of all the proofs of mercy and of all the dependability that you have shown to your servant. For with only my staff I crossed over this Jordan, and now I’ve become two camps. 
GEN.32.12	Deliver me, please, from my brother’s hand, from Esau’s hand, for I’m afraid of him that he’ll come and strike me—the mothers with the children. 
GEN.32.13	You Yourself said, ‘I will most certainly do good with you, and will make your seed like the sand of the sea that cannot be counted because of its abundance.’” 
GEN.32.14	So he stayed overnight there. Then from all that had come into his possession he took an offering for Esau his brother: 
GEN.32.15	 200 female goats, 20 billy goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 
GEN.32.16	 30 milking camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys. 
GEN.32.17	He put them in the hands of his servants, each herd by itself, and he said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a gap between each of the herds.” 
GEN.32.18	Then he commanded the first one saying, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do all these before you belong?’ 
GEN.32.19	then you are to say, ‘To your servant, to Jacob—it’s an offering sent to my lord, to Esau. And look, he’s also behind us.’” 
GEN.32.20	And he also commanded the second one, the third one, and all those who were going behind the flocks, saying, “Say the same exact thing to Esau when you find him. 
GEN.32.21	Then you are to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is also behind us.’” For he thought, “Let me appease him with the offering that goes ahead of me, and afterward see his face, perhaps he’ll lift up my face.” 
GEN.32.22	So the offering passed over ahead of him, while he spent that night in the camp. 
GEN.32.23	Then he got up that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.24	He took them and sent them across the stream, and he sent across whatever he had. 
GEN.32.25	So Jacob remained all by himself. Then a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn. 
GEN.32.26	When He saw that He had not overcome him, He struck the socket of his hip, so He dislocated the socket of Jacob’s hip when He wrestled with him. 
GEN.32.27	Then He said, “Let Me go, for the dawn has broken.” But he said, “I won’t let You go unless You bless me.” 
GEN.32.28	Then He said to him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he said. 
GEN.32.29	Then He said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but rather Israel, for you have struggled with God and with men, and you have overcome.” 
GEN.32.30	Then Jacob asked and said, “Please tell me Your name.” But He said, “What’s this—you are asking My name?” Then He blessed him there. 
GEN.32.31	So Jacob named the place Peniel, “for I’ve seen God face to face, and my life has been spared.” 
GEN.32.32	Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed by Peniel—limping because of his hip. 
GEN.32.33	That is why the children of Israel do not eat the tendon of the hip socket, to this very day, because He struck the socket of Jacob’s thigh on the tendon of the hip.
GEN.33.1	Then Jacob glanced up and saw, behold, there was Esau coming—and 400 men with him. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. 
GEN.33.2	He put the female servants and their children first, then Leah and her children behind them, then Rachel and Joseph behind them. 
GEN.33.3	But he himself passed on ahead of them, and bowed to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother. 
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, fell on his neck and kissed him—and they wept. 
GEN.33.5	His eyes glanced up and he saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” “The children whom God has graciously given your servant,” he said. 
GEN.33.6	Then the female servants approached, they and their children, and bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	Leah also approached, along with her children, and they bowed down, and finally, Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down. 
GEN.33.8	“What do you mean by this whole caravan that I’ve met?” So he said, “To find favor in your eyes, my lord.” 
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I have plenty! O my brother, do keep all that belongs to you.” 
GEN.33.10	Yet Jacob said, “No, please! If I have found favor in your eyes, then you will take my offering from my hand. For this is the reason I’ve seen your face—it is like seeing the face of God—and you’ve accepted me! 
GEN.33.11	Please, take my blessing that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me, and because I have everything.” So he kept urging him until he accepted. 
GEN.33.12	Then he said, “Let’s journey and be on our way, and I’ll go ahead of you. 
GEN.33.13	He continued, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and the cattle in my care are nursing. So if they were pushed hard just one day, all the flocks would die. 
GEN.33.14	Please, let my lord pass on ahead of your servant, and I’ll move on further gradually, at a pace suited to the livestock that are before me and at a pace suited to the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.” 
GEN.33.15	Then Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What’s this? Let me find favor in my lord’s eyes.” 
GEN.33.16	So on that day Esau returned on his way to Seir, 
GEN.33.17	but Jacob journeyed to Sukkot and built a house for himself, and for his livestock he made booths. That is the reason that place is called Sukkot. 
GEN.33.18	So Jacob arrived in 
GEN.33.19	He purchased the portion of the field there where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 pieces of money. 
GEN.33.20	There he set up an altar, and he called it, El is Israel’s God.
GEN.34.1	Now Dinah, Leah’s daughter whom she bore for Jacob, went out to look at the daughters of the land. 
GEN.34.2	When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	But his soul clung to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter, and he loved the young woman and spoke reassuringly to the young woman. 
GEN.34.4	So Shechem said to his father Hamor saying, “Get me this girl for a wife.” 
GEN.34.5	Now Jacob had heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah while his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept quiet until they came in. 
GEN.34.6	Meanwhile Shechem’s father Hamor went out to Jacob in order to speak with him. 
GEN.34.7	Jacob’s sons had already come in from the field when they heard, and the men were deeply grieved and furious, because he had committed a vile deed in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, which ought never to be done. 
GEN.34.8	But Hamor spoke with them saying, “My son Shechem—he’s very attached to your daughter. Please give her to him for a wife. 
GEN.34.9	Intermarry with us. You can give your daughters to us, and you can take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	You can live with us, and the land will be open to you: live in it, move about freely in it, and settle down in it.” 
GEN.34.11	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Would that I find favor in your eyes! Whatever you say to me I’ll give. 
GEN.34.12	Set the dowry and the presents as high as you like and I’ll give whatever you say to me. But give me the young woman as a wife.” 
GEN.34.13	But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully as they spoke, because he had defiled their sister Dinah. 
GEN.34.14	They said to them, “We can’t do this thing—give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised—for this is a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	Only by this will we consent to you: if you will become like us, by circumcising every male. 
GEN.34.16	Then we’ll give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves, and live with you, and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you don’t listen to us and be circumcised, we’ll take our daughter and leave.” 
GEN.34.18	Now their words seemed good to Hamor as well as Hamor’s son Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	So the young man did not hesitate to do it, since he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. Now he was honored above everyone else in his father’s house. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and his son Shechem came into the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying: 
GEN.34.21	“These men are enjoying a peaceful relationship with us and they are living in the land and moving about freely in it. As for the land, look, it’s spread out on both sides before us. We can take their daughters to be our wives, and we can give our daughters to them. 
GEN.34.22	But by this did these men consent to us, to live with us and to become one people—when all our males are circumcised as they are circumcised. 
GEN.34.23	Their livestock and their possessions: won’t they be ours? Only let us consent to them so that they’ll live with us.” 
GEN.34.24	Now everyone who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, every one who went out the gate of his city. 
GEN.34.25	Then on the third day while they were in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came against the city undisturbed and killed every male. 
GEN.34.26	Hamor and his son Shechem they killed with the sword, then took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left. 
GEN.34.27	Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and plundered the city because they defiled their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took their flocks, their cattle and their donkeys, those that were in the city as well as those that were in the field. 
GEN.34.29	All their wealth, their little children, and their wives they captured and plundered, as well as everything that was in the houses. 
GEN.34.30	But Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You’ve brought trouble on me, making me a stench among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am but a few men—they’ll gather against me and strike me—then I’ll be destroyed, my household and I.” 
GEN.34.31	But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”
GEN.35.1	Then God said to Jacob, “Get up! Go up to Beth-El and stay there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” 
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his household and to everyone who was with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Cleanse yourselves and change your clothes. 
GEN.35.3	Now let’s get up and go up to Beth-El so that I can make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and has been with me in the way that I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods in their hand and the rings in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak tree near Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	Then they journeyed, and the terror of God was on the cities that were around them, so they did not pursue Jacob’s sons. 
GEN.35.6	Then Jacob arrived at Luz in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-El), he and all the people who were with him. 
GEN.35.7	He built an altar there and called the place El-Beth-El because God had revealed Himself to him there when he fled from the presence of his brother. 
GEN.35.8	Then Rebekah’s nurse Deborah died, and was buried below Beth-El, under the oak—so it was named Oak of Weeping. 
GEN.35.9	God appeared to Jacob again, after he returned from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	God said to him: “Your name was Jacob. No longer will your name be Jacob, for your name will be Israel.” So He named him Israel. 
GEN.35.11	God also said to him: “I am 
GEN.35.12	The land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac— I give it to you, and to your seed after you I will give the land.” 
GEN.35.13	Then God went up from him at the place where He had spoken with him. 
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a memorial stone in the place where He had spoken with him—a stone pillar—and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	Jacob named the place where God spoke with him Beth-El.
GEN.35.16	Then they traveled from Beth-El, and while they were still a distance from entering Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, but her labor was difficult. 
GEN.35.17	While she was struggling to give birth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for this is also a son for you.” 
GEN.35.18	Now as her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Ben-Oni, but his father named him Benjamin. 
GEN.35.19	Then Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a memorial stone over her grave. (It is the memorial stone over Rachel’s grave to this day.)
GEN.35.21	Then Israel journeyed on and set up his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
GEN.35.22	While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Now Jacob had twelve sons. 
GEN.35.23	Leah’s sons were Jacob’s firstborn Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. 
GEN.35.24	Rachel’s sons were Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.35.25	The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s female servant, were Dan and Naphtali, 
GEN.35.26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, were Gad and Asher. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Paddan-aram. 
GEN.35.27	Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriat-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
GEN.35.28	Now Isaac’s days were 180 years. 
GEN.35.29	Then Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his peoples, old and full of days. So his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	Now these are the genealogies of Esau (that is, Edom). 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Tzivion the Hivite, 
GEN.36.3	and Basemath daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were Esau’s sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.36.6	Now Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters and all the people of his household, as well as his livestock, all his cattle, and all his possessions that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their possessions were too numerous for them to dwell together, and the land where they were residing was unable to support them because of their livestock. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau lived in Mount Seir (Esau is Edom). 
GEN.36.9	So these are the genealogies of Esau, the father of Edom in the hill country of Seir. 
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz son of Esau’s wife Adah and Reuel son of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
GEN.36.11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	Now Timna was a concubine to Esau’s son Eliphaz, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah. 
GEN.36.13	These are Reuel’s sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
GEN.36.14	These were the sons of Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, daughter of Esau’s wife Zibion—she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam and Korah. 
GEN.36.15	These are the chiefs from Esau’s sons. The sons of Eliphaz, Esau’s firstborn were chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs from Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	These are the sons of Esau’s son Reuel: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are chiefs from Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
GEN.36.18	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs from Oholibamah, daughter of Esau’s wife Anah. 
GEN.36.19	These are Esau’s sons, and these are their chiefs (that is, Edom). 
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister is Timna. 
GEN.36.23	These are Shobal’s sons: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	These are Zibeon’s sons: Aiah and Anah (that is, the Anah who found the hot springs in the desert while he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon). 
GEN.36.25	These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, Anah’s daughter. 
GEN.36.26	These are Dishon’s sons: Hemdan, Eshban, Itran and Cheran. 
GEN.36.27	These are Ezer’s sons: Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	These are Dishan’s sons: Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	These are the chiefs of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Tzivion, chief Anah, 
GEN.36.30	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan—these are the chiefs of the Horites according to their chiefly divisions in the land of Seir. 
GEN.36.31	Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel. 
GEN.36.32	Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom—the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.35	When Husham died, Haddad son of Bedad, who struck down the Midianites in the field of Moab, reigned in his place—the name of his city was Avit. 
GEN.36.36	When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.37	When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehovot by the River reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.38	When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.39	When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place—the name of his city is Pau, and his wife’s name is Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, daughter of Me-zehab. 
GEN.36.40	Now these are the names of the chiefs from Esau according to their family divisions, according to their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom according to their places of residence in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of Edom.
GEN.37.1	Now Jacob dwelled in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	These are the genealogies of Jacob. When Joseph was 17 years old (he was a youth), he was shepherding the flocks with his brothers—with the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah. Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father. 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age. So he had made him a long-sleeved tunic. 
GEN.37.4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak to him in 
GEN.37.5	Then Joseph dreamed a dream and told his brothers—and they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Please listen to this dream I dreamed. 
GEN.37.7	There we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field. All of a sudden, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 
GEN.37.8	“Will you truly be a king over us?” his brothers said to him. “Will you really rule over us?” So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of his words. 
GEN.37.9	But then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “I have just dreamed another dream. Suddenly, there was the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowing down to me!” 
GEN.37.10	He told it to his father as well as his brothers. Then his father rebuked him and said to him, “What’s this dream you dreamed? Will we really come—your mother and I with your brothers—to bow down to the ground to you?” 
GEN.37.11	So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the speech in mind.
GEN.37.12	Then his brothers went to graze their father’s flocks at Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers grazing the flocks in Shechem? Come, let me send you to them.” “Here I am,” he said to him. 
GEN.37.14	Then he said to him, “Go now, and check on the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flocks and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron and he went to Shechem. 
GEN.37.15	A man found him there, wandering in the field, and the man asked him, “What are you looking for?” 
GEN.37.16	“I’m looking for my brothers,” he said. “Please tell me where they’re grazing.” 
GEN.37.17	The man said, “They moved on from here. For I heard them saying, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	Now they saw him from a distance. Before he was close to them they plotted together against him in order to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Here comes the master of dreams! 
GEN.37.20	Come on now! Let’s kill him and throw him into one of those pits, so we can say that an evil animal devoured him. Then let’s see what becomes of his dreams.” 
GEN.37.21	But Reuben heard and rescued him out of their hands, saying, “We must not beat him to death.” 
GEN.37.22	In order to rescue him from their hand and to return him to his father, Reuben said to them, “Don’t shed blood! Throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him!” 
GEN.37.23	So as soon as Joseph came up to his brothers they stripped Joseph of his tunic (the long sleeved tunic that he had on). 
GEN.37.24	Then they took him and threw him into the pit. (Now the pit was empty, with no water in it.) 
GEN.37.25	Then they sat down to eat bread. When they looked up, behold, there was a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balsam, and myrrh—going to bring them down to Egypt. 
GEN.37.26	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come on! 
GEN.37.27	Let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let’s not lay our hand on him—since he’s our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers listened to him. 
GEN.37.28	When some men, Midianite merchants, passed by, they dragged Joseph up and out of the pit and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver, and they brought Joseph to Egypt. 
GEN.37.29	When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes. 
GEN.37.30	Then he returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! And I—where should I go?” 
GEN.37.31	So they took Joseph’s tunic, slaughtered a billy goat, and they dipped the tunic into the blood. 
GEN.37.32	Then they sent the long-sleeved tunic, and it was brought to their father, and they said, “We found this. Do you recognize whether or not it is your son’s tunic?” 
GEN.37.33	He did recognize it and said, “My son’s tunic! An evil animal has devoured him! Joseph must be torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	Jacob tore his clothing and put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	All his sons got up along with all his daughters to console him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to 
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile the Midianites sold him into Egypt, to Potiphar an official of Pharaoh, the commander of the bodyguards.
GEN.38.1	About that time Judah went down from his brothers and he camped near an Adullamite man, whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man whose name was Shua, and he took her as wife and slept with her. 
GEN.38.3	Then she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er. 
GEN.38.4	She became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	She gave birth to yet another son and she called him Shelah. He was in Chezib when she gave birth to him. 
GEN.38.6	Then Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan, go to your brother’s wife to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up a seed for your brother. 
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the seed would not be his. So every time he went to his brother’s wife he would destroy it on the ground so as not to provide a seed for his brother. 
GEN.38.10	What he did was evil in 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Stay as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up,” because he thought, “Otherwise he too might die, like his brothers.” So Tamar went and stayed in her father’s house. 
GEN.38.12	Now the days became many, and Shua’s daughter, Judah’s wife, died. After Judah consoled himself, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
GEN.38.13	Then Tamar was told, “Look! Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his flocks.” 
GEN.38.14	And she removed her widow’s clothes from herself, covered herself with a veil, wrapped herself, and sat by the entrance to the springs on the way to Timnah (for she saw that Shelah had grown up and she had not been given to him as a wife). 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	So he turned aside to her along the way and said, “Please let me sleep with you” (for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law). “What,” she asked, “will you give me to sleep with me?” 
GEN.38.17	“I will send you a young goat from the flock,” he said, “Provided you give a pledge until you send it,” she said. 
GEN.38.18	“What kind of pledge shall I give you?” he asked. “Your seal, and your cord, and your staff in your hand,” she said. So he gave them to her and he slept with her, and she got pregnant by him. 
GEN.38.19	After she got up and left, she removed her veil from herself and put on her widow’s clothes. 
GEN.38.20	When Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman’s hand, he could not find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked the men of her area saying, “Where is the cult prostitute? She was at the springs along the way.” But they said, “There hasn’t been a cult prostitute here.” 
GEN.38.22	So he returned to Judah and said, “I couldn’t find her, and the people of that place also said, ‘There hasn’t been a cult prostitute here.’” 
GEN.38.23	Then Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, or we’ll be held in contempt. Behold, I did send this young goat, but you couldn’t find her.” 
GEN.38.24	About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been a prostitute—look, she’s even pregnant by prostitution.” “Bring her out!” Judah said, “and let her be burned.” 
GEN.38.25	As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law saying, “I’m pregnant by the man to whom these things belong.” Then she said, “Do you recognize whose these are—the seal, the cords and the staff?” 
GEN.38.26	Then Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I didn’t give her to my son Shelah.” He was not intimate with her again. 
GEN.38.27	Now when it was time for her to give birth, behold there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	While she was giving birth, one stuck out his hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it to his hand saying, “This one came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	But as he was pulling his hand back in, behold, his brother came out. So she said, “How you have broken through! The breach is because of you.” And he named him Perez. 
GEN.38.30	Afterward his brother, on whose hand was the scarlet thread, came out. And he named him Zerah.
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, commander of the bodyguards, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there. 
GEN.39.2	But 
GEN.39.3	His master saw that 
GEN.39.4	Joseph found favor in his eyes, so he served him as a personal servant and he made him an overseer over his household; everything that was his he entrusted into his hand. 
GEN.39.5	From the time that he made him an overseer in his house and over everything that belonged to him, 
GEN.39.6	So he released everything he owned into Joseph’s hand. With him in charge, he did not think about anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance. 
GEN.39.7	Now after these things, the master’s wife lifted up her eyes at Joseph and said, “Come, lie down with me!” 
GEN.39.8	But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “my master doesn’t think about anything in the house with me in charge, and everything that belongs to him he’s entrusted into my hand. 
GEN.39.9	No one in this house is greater than I, and he has withheld nothing from me—except you, because you are his wife. So how could I commit this great evil and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	So whenever she spoke to Joseph, day after day, he did not listen to her invitation to lie down beside her, to be with her. 
GEN.39.11	Now on one such day, he came into the house to do his work, and none of the people of the house were there in the house. 
GEN.39.12	Then she grabbed him by his garment saying, “Come, lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand, fled and went outside. 
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside, 
GEN.39.14	she screamed to the men of her house and said to them, “Look! Someone brought a Hebrew man to us to fool with us. He approached me to lie with me so I screamed out loud. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me raise my voice and scream, he left his garment with me, fled and went outside.” 
GEN.39.16	Then she kept the garment with her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	She spoke the same words to him saying, “The Hebrew slave that you brought us approached me to fool with me. 
GEN.39.18	When I raised my voiced and screamed, he left his garment with me and fled outside.” 
GEN.39.19	Now when his master heard the words his wife spoke to him saying, “Such are the things your slave did to me,” his anger burned. 
GEN.39.20	Then Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So there he was, in the prison. 
GEN.39.21	But 
GEN.39.22	The commander of the prison entrusted into Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison, so that everything that was done there, he was responsible for it. 
GEN.39.23	The commander of the prison did not concern himself with anything at all under his care, because 
GEN.40.1	Now it was after these things that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, with the chief of the cupbearers and with the chief of the bakers. 
GEN.40.3	So he put them in custody of the house of the commander of the bodyguards—in the prison, the place where Joseph was confined. 
GEN.40.4	The commander of the bodyguards assigned Joseph to be with them and served them as their personal servant. They were in custody for some time. 
GEN.40.5	Then the two of them each dreamed a dream on the same night. The dream of each man—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each had its own interpretation. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he observed them, and there they were, looking miserable. 
GEN.40.7	So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in the custody of the house of his master saying, “Why are your faces so sad today?” 
GEN.40.8	They said to him, “We dreamed a dream and there is no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell me.” 
GEN.40.9	So the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph, saying to him, “In my dream, suddenly, there was a vine in front of me. 
GEN.40.10	On the vine were three branches, and as it was budding, its blossoms came out, its clusters ripened into grapes. 
GEN.40.11	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand and I took the grapes, pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm.” 
GEN.40.12	“This is its interpretation,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches: they are three days. 
GEN.40.13	In another three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. Then you’ll put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand just as you used to do before when you were his cupbearer. 
GEN.40.14	But if you remember me, that I was with you, when it goes well with you, please show me kindness and mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. 
GEN.40.15	For I was forcibly kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing at all that they should put me in this pit.” 
GEN.40.16	When the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream. Expectantly, there were three baskets of white bread on my head. 
GEN.40.17	In the top basket was food for Pharaoh—all kinds of baked goods. But the birds were eating them from the basket on my head.” 
GEN.40.18	Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets: they are three days. 
GEN.40.19	In another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—off of you—and will hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat your flesh off of you.” 
GEN.40.20	Then it happened on the third day—Pharaoh’s birthday—that he held a banquet for all his servants. He lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants. 
GEN.40.21	He restored the chief of the cupbearers as his cupbearer, and he put the cup on the palm of Pharaoh’s hand. 
GEN.40.22	But the chief of the bakers he hung. It was just as Joseph had interpreted for them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph—indeed, he forgot him.
GEN.41.1	Now at the end of two whole years, Pharaoh was dreaming. Behold, there he was standing by the Nile. 
GEN.41.2	Then behold, there were seven cows, good-looking and beefy, and they grazed in the reeds. 
GEN.41.3	Then behold, there were seven other cows coming up after them from the Nile, ugly and emaciated, and they stood beside the cows at the edge of the Nile. 
GEN.41.4	Then the ugly emaciated cows ate the seven good-looking beefy cows—and Pharaoh woke up. 
GEN.41.5	Then he slept and dreamed a second time: behold, there were seven ears of corn coming up on one stalk, plump and good. 
GEN.41.6	Then behold, there were seven ears of corn, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouting up after them. 
GEN.41.7	Then the seven thin ears of corn swallowed up the seven plump and full ears of corn. Then Pharaoh woke up—it was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	But in the morning he was disturbed in his spirit. So he sent and called for the fortune-telling priests of Egypt and all its wise men and Pharaoh told them his dream. But no one could interpret them for Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.9	Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh saying, “I am reminded of my sins today. 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh had been angry with his servants and put me in the custody of the house of the commander of the bodyguards—me and the chief of the bakers. 
GEN.41.11	Then we each dreamed a dream on the same night, he and I, we both dreamed, yet each dream had its own interpretation. 
GEN.41.12	Now there with us was a Hebrew youth—a slave belonging to the commander of the bodyguards. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams for us, each man’s dream he interpreted. 
GEN.41.13	Then it came about, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. Me he restored to my position, but him he hung. 
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph. So they quickly fetched him from the pit. He shaved, changed his clothes, and came to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream and there’s no one to interpret it. I heard about you— it’s said that you can listen to a dream to interpret it.” 
GEN.41.16	Then Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, “It’s not within me. God will answer with 
GEN.41.17	So Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream, there I was, standing by the bank of the Nile. 
GEN.41.18	And to my surprise, out of the Nile seven cows were coming up, beefy and good-looking, and they grazed in the reeds. 
GEN.41.19	Then all of a sudden, there were seven other cows coming up after them, feeble, very ugly and emaciated. I’ve never seen the likes of these in the whole land of Egypt for ugliness. 
GEN.41.20	Then the emaciated and ugly cows ate the first seven beefy cows. 
GEN.41.21	When they were devoured, one couldn’t tell that they had been devoured. Their appearance was as ugly as it was at first. Then I woke up. 
GEN.41.22	Then I saw in my dream, there were seven ears of corn coming up on one stalk, plump and good. 
GEN.41.23	Then suddenly, there were seven ears of corn, dried up, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouting up after them. 
GEN.41.24	Then the thin ears of corn swallowed up the seven good ears of corn. So I told the fortune-telling priests, but no one could provide me with an explanation.” 
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dream is one. God has told Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows: they are seven years. Also the seven ears of corn: they’re seven years. It is one dream. 
GEN.41.27	The seven emaciated and ugly cows coming up after them: they’re seven years. Also the seven empty ears of corn scorched by the east wind: there will be seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	It is the word that I have already said to Pharaoh: what God is about to do, he has shown to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.29	Seven years of abundance are about to come in the whole land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	Then seven years of famine will come up after them and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten and the famine will consume the land. 
GEN.41.31	So the abundance in the land will be unknown because of the famine that follows, for it will be a very oppressive famine. 
GEN.41.32	“Now as for repeating Pharaoh’s dream twice: it’s because the matter has been settled by God and God will quickly make it happen. 
GEN.41.33	So now, let Pharaoh select a man discerning and wise and set him in authority over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh act by appointing administrators over the land and take a fifth portion from the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
GEN.41.35	Then let them gather all the food from these good years that are coming, and let them store up grain under Pharaoh’s hand as food for the cities, so they may preserve it. 
GEN.41.36	Let the food be held in reserve for the land for the seven years of famine that is coming upon the land of Egypt. Then the land will not be annihilated by the famine.” 
GEN.41.37	Now the plan seemed good in the eyes of Pharaoh as well as all his servants. 
GEN.41.38	Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can a man like this be found, one in whom is God’s Spirit?” 
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. 
GEN.41.40	You! You will be over my house, and all my people will pay homage to you . Only in relation to the throne will I be greater than you.” 
GEN.41.41	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I appoint you over the whole land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, clothed him with fine linen garments, and put a chain of gold around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	Then he had him ride in the chariot as second-in-command, the one that belonged to him, and they called out before him, “Kneel down!” So he appointed him over the whole land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one will lift up his hand or his foot in the whole land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.45	Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. Then Joseph went out, in charge of the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.46	Now Joseph was 30 years old when he began serving as representative of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and passed throughout the whole land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	During the seven years of abundance, the land produced in heaps. 
GEN.41.48	So he gathered all the food in the land of Egypt during the seven years, and put food in the cities; the food from the city fields surrounding the cities he put in each city. 
GEN.41.49	So Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, vast amounts, until he stopped keeping record because it was beyond counting. 
GEN.41.50	Two sons also had been born to Joseph before the year of famine came, born to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph named his first-born Manasseh, “because God has caused me to forget all my trouble and all my father’s house.” 
GEN.41.52	And the second he named Ephraim, “because God has made me fruitful in the land of my oppression.” 
GEN.41.53	Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end, 
GEN.41.54	and the seven years of famine started to come—just as Joseph had said. So there was famine in all the lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was bread. 
GEN.41.55	When the whole land of Egypt suffered famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, and Pharaoh said to all of Egypt, “Go to Joseph. Do whatever he tells you.” 
GEN.41.56	The famine was over all the entire land, so Joseph opened up all that was among them and sold grain to Egypt. Then the famine became severe in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	Yet the whole world came to Egypt to buy grain—to Joseph—because the famine was severe in the whole world.
GEN.42.1	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, so Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you looking at each other?” 
GEN.42.2	Then he said, “Look! I’ve heard that there’s grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some grain for us there so that we’ll live and not die.” 
GEN.42.3	So Joseph’s brothers went down, ten of them, to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob did not send, for he said, “An accident might happen to him.” 
GEN.42.5	The sons of Israel went to buy grain among the others who were coming, because the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was the ruler over the land. He was the provider of grain for all the people of the earth. 
GEN.42.7	Then Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with faces to the ground. When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he made himself unrecognizable to them. Then he spoke harshly and said to them, “Where have you come from?” “From the land of Canaan,” they said, “to buy grain as food.” 
GEN.42.8	Though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	Then Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them. He said to them, “You’re spies! You’ve come to see the undefended places in the land.” 
GEN.42.10	“No, my lord!” they said to him. “Your servants came to buy grain as food. 
GEN.42.11	All of us—we are sons of one man. We’re honest. Your servants have never been spies.” 
GEN.42.12	“Not so,” he said to them. “Rather, you’ve come to see the undefended places in the land.” 
GEN.42.13	But they said, “We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan. Look, the youngest is with our father today and the other one is no more.” 
GEN.42.14	Joseph said to them, “It’s just like I told you when I said, ‘You’re spies.’ 
GEN.42.15	By this you’ll be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you’ll not leave from here until your youngest brother comes here! 
GEN.42.16	Send one from among yourselves to get your brother, while you remain confined, in order to test your words, to see whether the truth is with you. If not, by the life of Pharaoh, you’re definitely spies!” 
GEN.42.17	So he put them together in custody for three days. 
GEN.42.18	Then Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and you will live. I fear God. 
GEN.42.19	If you’re honest, let one of your brothers remain as a prisoner in the guardhouse where you’ve been, while you, go and bring grain for the hunger in your homes. 
GEN.42.20	And your youngest brother, bring to me so that your words can be verified—and you won’t die.” So they did. 
GEN.42.21	Then each man said to his brother, “We’re truly guilty for our brother. We saw the distress of his soul when he begged us for mercy, but we didn’t listen. That’s why this distress has come to us.” 
GEN.42.22	Reuben answered them and said, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t sin against the boy’? But you didn’t listen. Now, see how his blood is now being accounted for.” 
GEN.42.23	They did not know that Joseph was listening, since there was an interpreter between them. 
GEN.42.24	He turned away from them and wept. When he turned back to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and tied him up before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. So it was done for them. 
GEN.42.26	Then they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left from there. 
GEN.42.27	As one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodge, he saw his money—behold, it was in the opening of his bag. 
GEN.42.28	So he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! Look, it’s in my bag.” Their hearts sank. Trembling, each one turned to his brother and said, “What is this that God has done to us?” 
GEN.42.29	When they came to their father Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	“The man, the lord of the land, spoke with us harshly, and took us as spies of the land. 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him, ‘We’re honest. We’ve never been spies. 
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’ 
GEN.42.33	Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I’ll know if you’re honest: leave one of your brothers with me. As for the hunger of your homes: take and go! 
GEN.42.34	Then bring your youngest brother to me, so that I may know you are not spies, but you are honest. I’ll give you back your brother and you can move about freely in the land.’” 
GEN.42.35	Now as they were emptying their sacks, behold, there was each man’s bundle of money in his sack. When they saw their money bundles, they and their father, they were afraid. 
GEN.42.36	Then their father Jacob said to them, “You’ve made me childless! Joseph is no more. Now Simeon is gone, and next you’ll take Benjamin! Everything is against me!” 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “You can put my two sons to death if I don’t bring him back to you. Put him in my hand and I—I will return him to you.” 
GEN.42.38	But he said, “My son will not go down with you—for his brother is dead and he alone remains. And if harm should happen to him along the way you’re going, you’ll bring my grey hair down to 
GEN.43.1	Now the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.43.2	When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt their father said to them, “Go back. Buy us a little food.” 
GEN.43.3	But Judah said to him, “The man warned us firmly saying, ‘You won’t see my face unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy grain for you for food. 
GEN.43.5	But if you won’t send him, we won’t go down, because the man said to us, ‘You won’t see my face unless your brother is with you.’” 
GEN.43.6	Then Israel said, “Why did you do evil to me by telling the man that you have another brother?” 
GEN.43.7	They said, “The man questioned particularly about us and about our relatives saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?’ So we spoke to him on the basis of these words. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’”? 
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Please, send the boy with me and we’ll get up and go, so that we’ll live and not die—we and you, and our children. 
GEN.43.9	I myself will be his pledge. You can demand him back from my own hand. If I don’t bring him back to you and place him before you, then you can blame me all my days. 
GEN.43.10	If we had not delayed, we could have returned twice by now.” 
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and bring an offering down to the man—a little balsam and a little honey, gum and myrrh, pistachios and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	Also take in your hand a double portion of silver, and bring back in your hand the silver that had been returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother too—now, get up, go back to the man! 
GEN.43.14	May 
GEN.43.15	Then the men took this offering. They also took the double portion of silver in their hand, as well as Benjamin. So they got up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the one over his house, “Bring the men into the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me this afternoon. 
GEN.43.17	So the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house. 
GEN.43.18	But the men were afraid, because they had been brought into Joseph’s house. They said, “It’s because of the silver that was returned to our sacks the first time that we are being brought in—to pounce on us and fall on us and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” 
GEN.43.19	So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house. 
GEN.43.20	“I beg your pardon, my lord!” they said. “We indeed came down on the previous occasion to buy grain for food. 
GEN.43.21	When we came to the lodge and opened our sacks, behold, there was each man’s money at the opening of the sack, the full amount of our money. So we’ve returned it in our hand. 
GEN.43.22	Moreover, we’ve brought down other money in our hand to buy grain for food. We didn’t know who put our money into our sacks.” 
GEN.43.23	“Be at peace,” he replied. “Don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. Your money had come to me.” Then he brought Simeon out to them, 
GEN.43.24	and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water and they washed their feet. He also provided fodder for their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	So they prepared the offering for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were going to eat there. 
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they brought him the offering in their hand into the house, and they bowed down to the ground to him. 
GEN.43.27	Then he asked if they were well, and said, “Is he well—your elderly father that you told me about? Is he still alive?” 
GEN.43.28	“Your servant, our father, is well,” they said. “He’s still alive.” Then they knelt and bowed down. 
GEN.43.29	Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother whom you mentioned to me?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph hurried out because his compassion grew warm and tender toward his brother so that he wanted to cry. So he went into an inner room and wept there. 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face, came out, and controlled himself. “Serve the food,” he said. 
GEN.43.32	So they served him by himself, them by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves (for Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews because it was an abomination to Egyptians). 
GEN.43.33	They were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. The men looked at each other in astonishment. 
GEN.43.34	Then portions were brought to them from before him—and Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of their portions. Yet they drank and made merry with him.
GEN.44.1	Then he commanded the one over his household saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they are able to carry and put money in the opening of each man’s sack. 
GEN.44.2	Put my cup, the silver cup, in the opening of the sack of the youngest along with his grain money.” So he did as Joseph told him. 
GEN.44.3	When the morning dawned, the men were sent off, they and their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	They left the city and did not get far, when Joseph said to the one over his household, “Get up, go after the men. When you catch up to them, say to them, “Why have you repaid evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	Isn’t this the one from which my lord drinks? He even uses it especially to discern by divination. What you’ve done is evil!” 
GEN.44.6	So he caught up to them and spoke these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	They said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing as this. 
GEN.44.8	Look, the money we found in the opening of our bags, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. So how could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? 
GEN.44.9	Whoever among your servants is found with it, let him die! And we, we’ll also be my lord’s slaves.” 
GEN.44.10	“Even now let it be according to your words,” he said. “The one with whom it is found shall be my slave. But the rest of you shall be innocent.” 
GEN.44.11	Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and each man opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	He searched them beginning with the eldest and finishing with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they tore their clothing, and each one loaded up his donkey and they returned to the city. 
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers entered Joseph’s house, he was still there. They fell to the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	“What’s this deed you’ve done?” Joseph said to them, “Didn’t you know that a man like me can discern by divination?” 
GEN.44.16	Then Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we as well as the one in whose hand the cup was found.” 
GEN.44.17	But he said, “Far be it from me to do this. The one in whose hand the cup was found—he will be my slave. But you, go up to your father in peace.” 
GEN.44.18	Then Judah approached him and said, “I beg your pardon, my lord. Please let your servant say a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t be angry with your servant, since you are like Pharaoh. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants saying, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	So we said to my lord, ‘We have a father who is old, a child born to him of his old age is young. Now his brother is dead, so he is the only one of his mother’s children left, and his father loves him.’ 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can look at him.’ 
GEN.44.22	But we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave his father, he would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you won’t see my face again.’ 
GEN.44.24	“Now when we went up to your servant, my father, we told him my lord’s words. 
GEN.44.25	Then our father said, ‘Go back, buy us a little grain for food.’ 
GEN.44.26	So we said, ‘We won’t go down unless we have our youngest brother with us—then we’ll go down. For we won’t see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
GEN.44.27	“Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You yourselves know that my wife bore me two sons. 
GEN.44.28	One went out from me, so I said, “He must have been torn to shreds,” and I haven’t seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	And if you also take this one away from before me and an accident happens to him, then you’ll bring my grey hair down to the evil of 
GEN.44.30	“Now if I come to your servant my father and the boy isn’t with us, since his life is bound to his life, 
GEN.44.31	when he sees that the boy is no more, he’ll die. Then your servants will bring the grey hair of your servant our father down to 
GEN.44.32	For your servant became pledge for the boy with my father saying, ‘If I don’t bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before my father all my days.’ 
GEN.44.33	So now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave in the boy’s place, and let the boy go up with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how can I go up to my father and the boy is not with me? Else I must see the evil that would come upon my father!”
GEN.45.1	Now Joseph could no longer restrain himself in front of all those who were standing by him, so he cried out, “Get everyone away from me!” So no one stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
GEN.45.2	But he gave his voice to weeping so that the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh’s household heard. 
GEN.45.3	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” And his brothers were unable to answer him because they were terrified at his presence. 
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near me.” So they came near. “I’m Joseph, your brother—the one you sold to Egypt,” he said. 
GEN.45.5	“So now, don’t be grieved and don’t be angry in your own eyes that you sold me here—since it was for preserving life that God sent me here before you. 
GEN.45.6	For there has been two years of famine in the land, and there will be five more years yet with no plowing or harvesting. 
GEN.45.7	But God sent me ahead of you to ensure a remnant in the land and to keep you alive for a great escape. 
GEN.45.8	So now, it wasn’t you, you didn’t send me here, but God! And He made me as a father to Pharaoh, lord over his whole house and ruler over the entire land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	“Go up quickly to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son, Joseph: God has made me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t delay. 
GEN.45.10	Then you’ll live in the land of Goshen, and be close to me, you and your children and your children’s children, your flocks and your cattle, and everything that belongs to you. 
GEN.45.11	I’ll provide food for you there—for the famine will last another five years—otherwise you’ll lose everything, you and your household, and everything that belongs to you.’ 
GEN.45.12	And look, you and my brother Benjamin can see with your own eyes that it’s my mouth that’s speaking to you. 
GEN.45.13	You must tell my father about all my honor in Egypt, and about all that you’ve seen. And you must quickly bring my father down here.” 
GEN.45.14	Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept while Benjamin wept upon his neck, 
GEN.45.15	and he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. Finally after this, his brothers talked with him. 
GEN.45.16	When the commotion was heard in Pharaoh’s house—“Joseph’s brothers have come!”—it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, 
GEN.45.17	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers: ‘Do this! Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Then get your father, your households, and come to me. I’ll give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	You are also commanded to say: “Do this! Take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little children and for your wives, and pick up your father and come. 
GEN.45.20	Don’t be concerned about your goods, because the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’” 
GEN.45.21	So the sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them carts by Pharaoh’s command and he gave them provisions for the journey. 
GEN.45.22	To each of them he gave a change of clothes, while to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five sets of clothes. 
GEN.45.23	Also to his father he sent the following: ten donkeys carrying from the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys carrying grain and food and provisions for his father’s journey. 
GEN.45.24	Then he sent his brothers off, and as they departed, he said to them, “Don’t be anxious on the way.” 
GEN.45.25	Then they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. 
GEN.45.26	They told him saying, “Joseph is still alive and he is ruler of the whole land of Egypt!” His heart went numb, for he did not believe them. 
GEN.45.27	But they told him all of Joseph’s words that he had told them. When he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to pick him up, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 
GEN.45.28	Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I must go and see him, before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Israel set out, along with everything that belonged to him. When he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	In visions of the night God said to Israel, “Jacob, Jacob.” “
GEN.46.3	“I am God, the God of your father,” He said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will turn you into a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I Myself will go down with you to Egypt and I Myself will also most certainly bring you up. Joseph will put his hands on your eyes.” 
GEN.46.5	Then Jacob arose from Beersheba and Israel’s sons carried Jacob their father, their little children, and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	They also took their livestock and their possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan and they came to Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him. 
GEN.46.7	His sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his offspring, he brought with him to Egypt. 
GEN.46.8	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn, Reuben, 
GEN.46.9	and Reuben’s sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	Simeon’s sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zochar and Shaul the son of the Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	Judah’s sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah. Er died along with Onan in the land of Canaan. Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	Issachar’s sons: Tola, Puvah, Iob and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	Zebulun’s sons: Sered, Elon and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are Leah’s sons whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, along with his daughter Dinah. The tally of all of his sons and daughters was 33 people. 
GEN.46.16	Gad’s sons: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	Asher’s sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. Beriah’s sons: Heber and Malchiel. 
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. She bore these to Jacob: 16 people. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt—Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore them to him. 
GEN.46.21	Benjamin’s sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These are Rachel’s sons who were born to Jacob. The tally of all the people was 14. 
GEN.46.23	The sons of Dan: Hushim 
GEN.46.24	Naphtali’s sons: Yachzeel, Guni, Yezer and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter and she bore these to Jacob. The tally of all the people was seven. 
GEN.46.26	All the people belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt—those coming from his loins (not counting the wives of Jacob’s sons)—the tally of all the people was 66. 
GEN.46.27	The sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt was a tally of two people. The tally of all the people belonging to Jacob’s house who came to Egypt was 70. 
GEN.46.28	Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph to show him the way to Goshen. When they came to the land of Goshen, 
GEN.46.29	Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as he appeared before him, he fell upon his neck, and wept on his neck for some time. 
GEN.46.30	Then Israel said to Joseph, “At this time I am ready to die, after seeing your face in person—for you’re still alive!” 
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I’ll go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 
GEN.46.32	The men are shepherds, for they’ve been men who handle livestock, who have brought their flocks and cattle and everything that they possess.’ 
GEN.46.33	So when Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	you must say, ‘Your servants have been men who handle livestock since the time of our youth until now, both we and our fathers,’ so that you can live in the land of Goshen, because every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph came and informed Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers and their flocks and their cattle and everything that belongs to them have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	From among his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” So they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.” 
GEN.47.4	Then they said to Pharaoh, “We came to dwell temporarily in the land, since there is no pasture for the flocks that belong to your servants, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.5	Pharaoh said to Joseph saying, “Your father and your brothers came to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is before you—settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any capable men among them, make them overseers of the livestock—over those that are mine.” 
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	 Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How many days are the years of your life?” 
GEN.47.9	Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourn are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life. Moreover, the days of the years of my life have not attained the days of the years of the lives of my fathers, in the days of their sojourn.” 
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from Pharaoh’s presence. 
GEN.47.11	Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh commanded. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph supported his father and his brothers and his father’s entire household with food for the mouths of the little ones. 
GEN.47.13	Now there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe. Both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain that they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.47.15	Then the money of the land of Egypt and of the land of Canaan ran out and all of Egypt came to Joseph saying, “Give us food. Why should we die in front of you because the money is gone?” 
GEN.47.16	Joseph said, “Give your livestock and I’ll give it to you for your livestock, if the money is gone.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph and Joseph gave them food in exchange for horses, for flocks of sheep, for herds of cattle and for donkeys. He provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 
GEN.47.18	When that year came to an end, they came to him in the second year and said to him, “We won’t hide from my lord that the money has run out and the livestock and the domestic animals are my lord’s. There is nothing left in my lord’s sight except our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your eyes—both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food—we and our land will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Provide seed so that we may live and not die, and the land won’t be deserted.” 
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh because the Egyptians, each one, sold his field, for the famine overcame them. Thus the land became Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.21	He made the people slaves from one end of Egypt’s border to the other. 
GEN.47.22	Only he did not buy the land belonging to the priests, because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they ate their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, so that you can sow the land. 
GEN.47.24	During the harvest you must give a fifth part to Pharaoh and four-fifths will be for you, for seed for the field and for your food, and for those in your houses, and for food for your little ones.” 
GEN.47.25	“You’ve saved our lives,” they said. “We find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we’ll be Pharaoh’s slaves.” 
GEN.47.26	So Joseph set it as a statute until this very day concerning the land of Egypt: a fifth-part goes to Pharaoh. Only the priests’ land did not become Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.27	Meanwhile, Israel settled in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen, acquired property in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.
GEN.47.28	Now Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for 17 years, so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years. 
GEN.47.29	As the time of Israel’s death drew near, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh and show me faithful kindness. Please do not bury me in Egypt. 
GEN.47.30	When I lie down with my fathers, you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” So he said, “I myself will do according to your word.” 
GEN.47.31	“Swear to me,” he said. So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed down in worship on the head of his staff.
GEN.48.1	After these things, someone told Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him. 
GEN.48.2	When someone told Jacob, saying, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel summoned his strength and sat up in the bed. 
GEN.48.3	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “
GEN.48.4	He said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and multiply you and turn you into an assembly of peoples, and I will give this land to your seed after you as an everlasting possession.’ 
GEN.48.5	So now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just like Reuben and Simeon. 
GEN.48.6	Any descendent of yours whom you father after them will be yours; they will be identified by the names of their brothers for their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	“Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way, in the land of Canaan, while we were still a distance from entering Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” 
GEN.48.8	Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons and said, “Who are these?” 
GEN.48.9	Joseph said to his father, “They’re my sons, whom God has given me here.” Then he said, “Please bring them to me, so I may bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Now Israel’s eyes had grown heavy with old age—he could not see. So he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and hugged them. 
GEN.48.11	Then Israel said to Joseph, “To see your face, I didn’t expect—and look, God has let me see your offspring as well!” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph took them from his knees and bowed with his face down to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	Then Joseph took the two of them—Ephraim with his right hand across from Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand across from Israel’s right—and brought them close to him. 
GEN.48.14	But Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it upon Ephraim’s head (though he was the younger), and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, crossing his hands (though Manasseh was the firstborn). 
GEN.48.15	Then he blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has shepherded me throughout my life to this day, 
GEN.48.16	The Angel who redeemed me from all evil, May He bless the boys, and may they be called by my name, and by the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. May they multiply to a multitude in the midst of the land.” 
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand upon Ephraim’s head, it was wrong in his eyes. So his took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to his father, “Not like that, my father, because this one’s the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.” 
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will become great. But his younger brother will become greater than he and his seed will be the fullness of the nations.” 
GEN.48.20	Then he blessed them that day saying, “In you shall Israel bless by saying: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die. But God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	Now I myself give you one portion more than your brothers, that which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”
GEN.49.1	Jacob called his sons and said to them: Gather together so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the last days. 
GEN.49.2	Be assembled and listen, sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father. 
GEN.49.3	Reuben, my firstborn are you, my vigor and firstborn of my power, endowed with extra dignity, endowed with extra strength— 
GEN.49.4	like water boiling over you will not have extra, for you got up into your father’s bed, when you defiled a maid’s couch. 
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brothers, instruments of violence are their knives. 
GEN.49.6	In their secret counsel may my soul not enter. In their contingent may my honor never be united. For in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they maimed oxen. 
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger for it was strong and their rage for it was cruel— I will disperse them in Jacob, I will scatter them in Israel. 
GEN.49.8	Judah, so you are— your brothers will praise you: Your hand will be on your enemies’ neck. Your father’s sons will bow down to you. 
GEN.49.9	A lion’s cub is Judah— from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He crouches, lies down like a lion, or like a lioness— who would rouse him? 
GEN.49.10	The scepter will not pass from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs will come. To him will be the obedience of the peoples. 
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, he washes his garments in wine, and in the blood of grapes his robe. 
GEN.49.12	His eyes are darker than wine, and teeth that are whiter than milk. 
GEN.49.13	Zebulun will dwell by the seashore, and be by a harbor for ships— his distant border reaches Sidon. 
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong-boned donkey, lying down between two saddlebags. 
GEN.49.15	He saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant. He leaned his shoulder to bear a burden, and became a forced laborer. 
GEN.49.16	Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 
GEN.49.17	Let Dan be a serpent beside a road, a viper beside a path, who strikes a horse’s heels, so that its rider falls backward. 
GEN.49.18	For your salvation I wait, 
GEN.49.19	Gad—attackers will attack him, but he will attack their heels. 
GEN.49.20	Asher—rich is his food— he will provide delicacies fit for a king. 
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a doe let loose, who offers words of beauty. 
GEN.49.22	A fruitful son is Joseph, a fruitful son beside a spring— daughters walk along a wall. 
GEN.49.23	The archers were bitter and shot arrows and were hostile towards him. 
GEN.49.24	Yet his bow was always filled, and his arms quick-moving— by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From there a Shepherd, the Stone of Israel, 
GEN.49.25	from the God of your father who helps you, and 
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father surpassed the blessings of the ancient mountains, the desire of the everlasting hills. May they be upon Joseph’s head, upon the crown of the one set apart from his brothers. 
GEN.49.27	Benjamin is a ravening wolf— in the morning he devours spoils, and in the evening divides plunder. 
GEN.49.28	These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this is what their father spoke to them. He blessed them, each one he blessed with a suitable blessing. 
GEN.49.29	Then he charged them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, that is next to Mamre in the land of Canaan—the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a property for burial. 
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, and there I buried Leah. 
GEN.49.32	The field was purchased along with the cave in it from the sons of Het.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, then breathed his last and was gathered to his peoples.
GEN.50.1	Joseph fell upon his father’s face, wept over him and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	Then Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father, so the physicians embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	They took 40 days for him, because that is how long embalming takes, and Egypt wept 70 days. 
GEN.50.4	When the days of formal weeping passed, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s house saying, “If I’ve found favor in your eyes, please say in Pharaoh’s ears, 
GEN.50.5	“My father made me take an oath saying, ‘Behold, I am about to die. In my tomb—which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan—there you must bury me.’ So now, please allow me to go up and bury my father, and then return.” 
GEN.50.6	Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father just as he made you swear on oath.” 
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father. Also all of Pharaoh’s servants, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt went up with him, 
GEN.50.8	along with all of Joseph’s house, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and cattle were left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	Chariots and horsemen also went up with him—it was a very impressive company. 
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing floor of the bramble on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned there—a very great and solemn lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father. 
GEN.50.11	When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning ritual at the threshing floor of the prickly bush, they said, “A solemn mourning ritual this is for the Egyptians.” That is why it is named Abel-Mizraim, which is on the other side of the Jordan. 
GEN.50.12	So Jacob’s sons did for him just as he commanded them. 
GEN.50.13	His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, the field that Abraham bought as a property for burial from Ephron the Hittite, next to Mamre. 
GEN.50.14	After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all those who went up with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father had died, they said, “Maybe Joseph will be hostile towards us and pay us back in full for all the evil we showed him. 
GEN.50.16	So they charged Joseph saying, “Before his death, your father gave a command, saying, 
GEN.50.17	“Thus you must say to Joseph: ‘Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin because they treated you wrongly.’ Therefore, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Then Joseph wept when they spoke to him, 
GEN.50.18	and his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your slaves!” 
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. For am I in the place of God? 
GEN.50.20	Yes, you yourselves planned evil against me. God planned it for good, in order to bring about what it is this day—to preserve the lives of many people. 
GEN.50.21	So now, don’t be afraid. I myself will provide food for you and your little ones.” So he reassured them, speaking kindly to them. 
GEN.50.22	Joseph remained in Egypt—he and his father’s household—and Joseph lived 110 years. 
GEN.50.23	Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s sons. Also the sons of Machir, Manasseh’s son, were born upon Joseph’s knees. 
GEN.50.24	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I’m about to die. But God will surely take notice of you and will bring you up from this land to the land that He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph made Israel’s sons swear an oath saying, “When God takes notice of you, you will bring my bones up from here.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died at 110 years old, and they embalmed him and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	The souls that came out of the line of Jacob numbered 70 in all, while Joseph was already in Egypt. 
EXO.1.6	Then Joseph died, as did all his brothers and all that generation. 
EXO.1.7	Yet 
EXO.1.8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “Look, the people of 
EXO.1.10	Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, or else they will grow even more numerous, so that if war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and then escape from the land.” 
EXO.1.11	So they set slave masters over them to afflict them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Raamses as storage cities for Pharaoh. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread. So the Egyptians dreaded the presence of 
EXO.1.13	They worked them harshly, 
EXO.1.14	and made their lives bitter with hard labor with mortar and brick, doing all sorts of work in the fields. In all their labors they worked them with cruelty. 
EXO.1.15	Moreover the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, 
EXO.1.16	and said, “When you help the Hebrew women during childbirth, look at the sex. If it’s a son, then kill him, but if it’s a daughter, she may live.” 
EXO.1.17	Yet the midwives feared God, so they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this—let the boys live?” 
EXO.1.19	The midwives told Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women. They are like animals, and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” 
EXO.1.20	So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, growing very numerous. 
EXO.1.21	Because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own. 
EXO.1.22	But Pharaoh charged all his people saying, “You are to cast every son that is born into the river, but let every daughter live.”
EXO.2.1	Now a man from the house of Levi took as his wife a daughter of Levi. 
EXO.2.2	The woman conceived and gave birth to a son. Now when she saw that he was delightful, she hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could no longer hide him, she took a basket of papyrus reeds, coated it with tar and pitch, put the child inside, and laid it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 
EXO.2.4	His sister stood off at a distance to see what would happen to him. 
EXO.2.5	Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe, while her maidens walked along by the riverside. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaiden to fetch it. 
EXO.2.6	When she opened it, she saw the child—look, a baby boy crying! She had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.” 
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?” 
EXO.2.8	Pharaoh’s daughter told her, “Go!” So the girl went and called the child’s mother. 
EXO.2.9	Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	After the boy grew older she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. So she named him Moses saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.” 
EXO.2.11	Now it happened in those days, after Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He noticed an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
EXO.2.12	So he looked around and when he saw that there was nobody, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	Then he went out the following day, and saw two Hebrew men fighting. So he said to the guilty one, “Why are you beating your companion?” 
EXO.2.14	But the man answered, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you saying you’re going to kill me—just as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “For sure the deed had become known.” 
EXO.2.15	When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well. 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters who came and drew water. They filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
EXO.2.17	But shepherds came and drove them away, so Moses stood up, helped them and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	When they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How come you’ve returned so soon today?” 
EXO.2.19	So they told him, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds. He also drew water for us and watered the flock.” 
EXO.2.20	“Where is he then?” he said to his daughters. “Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have some food to eat!” 
EXO.2.21	Moses was content to stay on with the man. Later he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah. 
EXO.2.22	She gave birth to a son and he named him Gershom, saying, “I have been an outsider in a foreign land.” 
EXO.2.23	Now it came about over the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died. 
EXO.2.24	God heard their sobbing and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	God saw 
EXO.3.1	Now Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. So he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness, coming to the mountain of God, Horeb. 
EXO.3.2	Then the angel of 
EXO.3.3	Moses thought, “I will go now, and see this great sight. Why is the bush not burnt?” 
EXO.3.4	When 
EXO.3.5	Then He said, “Come no closer. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	Moreover He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” So Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. 
EXO.3.7	Then 
EXO.3.8	So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up out of that land into a good and large land, a land flowing with milk and honey, into the place of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
EXO.3.9	Now behold, the cry of 
EXO.3.10	Come now, I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people 
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring 
EXO.3.12	So He said, “I will surely be with you. So that will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt: you will worship God on this mountain.” 
EXO.3.13	But Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to 
EXO.3.14	God answered Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. ” Then He said, “You are to say to 
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses: “You are to say to 
EXO.3.16	“Go now, gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them: ‘
EXO.3.17	So I promise I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’ 
EXO.3.18	“They will listen to your voice. So you will go, you along with the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and say to him: ‘
EXO.3.19	Nevertheless, I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except by a mighty hand. 
EXO.3.20	So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders that I will do in the midst of it. After that, he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	“Then I shall grant these people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. So it will happen that when you go, you will not leave empty-handed. 
EXO.3.22	Every woman is to ask her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing. You will put them on your sons and your daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Then Moses said, “But look, they will not believe me or listen to my voice. They will say, ‘
EXO.4.2	So 
EXO.4.3	Then He said, “Cast it on the ground.” When he cast it to the ground, it became a serpent, so Moses fled from before it. 
EXO.4.4	Then 
EXO.4.5	“This is so that they may believe 
EXO.4.6	 also said to him, “Now put your hand within your cloak.” So he put his hand inside, and when he took it out, his hand had 
EXO.4.7	Then He said, “Put your hand back into your cloak.” So he put his hand back in, and when he took it out it was restored again as the rest of his skin. 
EXO.4.8	Then He said, “If they do not believe you, or listen to the voice of the first sign, they will believe the message of the latter sign. 
EXO.4.9	But if they do not believe even these two signs nor listen to your voice, you are to take the water of the river and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the ground.” 
EXO.4.10	But Moses said to 
EXO.4.11	So 
EXO.4.12	Now go! I will be with your mouth and teach you what to say.” 
EXO.4.13	But he said, “Please, please, send it by another hand.” 
EXO.4.14	Then the anger of 
EXO.4.15	You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his, and teach you what to do. 
EXO.4.16	He will be your spokesman to the people, so that he may act as a mouthpiece for you, and it will be as if you were as God for him. 
EXO.4.17	Now then, you must take this staff in your hand to do the signs.”
EXO.4.18	So Moses went, returned to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me go, so I may return to my kinsmen who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
EXO.4.19	Then 
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and his sons, set them on a donkey and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took the staff of God in his hand. 
EXO.4.21	 said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in your hand. Still, I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go. 
EXO.4.22	You are to say to Pharaoh, “This is what 
EXO.4.23	So I have said to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me, but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay your son, your firstborn.’” 
EXO.4.24	It happened along the way, at a lodging place, that 
EXO.4.25	But Zipporah took a flint, cut off the foreskin of her son, and threw it at his feet, saying, “You are surely a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
EXO.4.26	She said, “A bridegroom of blood” because of the circumcision. Then He let him alone. 
EXO.4.27	Now 
EXO.4.28	Then Moses told Aaron all the words of 
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of 
EXO.4.30	Aaron spoke all the words that 
EXO.4.31	So the people believed. When they heard that 
EXO.5.1	Afterward, Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “This is what 
EXO.5.2	But Pharaoh said, “Who is 
EXO.5.3	They answered, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so we may sacrifice to 
EXO.5.4	But the king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, make the people break loose from their work? Go to your labors!” 
EXO.5.5	Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now so numerous, yet you would have them rest from their labors?” 
EXO.5.6	Then on the same day Pharaoh commanded the slave masters of the people and their foremen saying, 
EXO.5.7	“You are not to give the people any more straw to make bricks, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	But impose on them the quota of bricks that they made previously; don’t reduce it. For they are lazy—that’s why they cry out saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Let even heavier work be laid upon the men, so that they must labor, paying no attention to deceptive words.” 
EXO.5.10	Then the slave masters of the people went out, along with their officers, and they spoke to the people saying: “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, for there will be no reduction of your work.” 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	But the slave masters pressured, saying, “Fulfill your work, your daily amount, just as when there was straw.” 
EXO.5.14	Moreover the foremen of 
EXO.5.15	The foremen of 
EXO.5.16	No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and look, your servants are beaten. But it is your own people at fault.” 
EXO.5.17	But he said, “Lazy! You’re lazy! That’s why you were saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to 
EXO.5.18	So go now and work! No straw will be given to you—but you must deliver the quota of bricks.” 
EXO.5.19	So the foremen of 
EXO.5.20	Then they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them as they came from Pharaoh. 
EXO.5.21	So they said to them, “May 
EXO.5.22	So Moses returned to 
EXO.5.23	Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your Name, he has brought evil on these people. You have not delivered Your people at all.”
EXO.6.1	 said to Moses, “Now you will see what I am going to do to Pharaoh. By way of a strong hand he will let them go, and drive them out of his land.”
EXO.6.2	God spoke further to Moses and said to him, “I am 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob, as 
EXO.6.4	I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage where they journeyed. 
EXO.6.5	Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of 
EXO.6.6	Therefore say to 
EXO.6.7	I will take you to Myself as a people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am 
EXO.6.8	So I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob, and give it to you as an inheritance. I am 
EXO.6.9	Moses spoke this way to 
EXO.6.10	So 
EXO.6.11	“Go, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that will he let 
EXO.6.12	But Moses said to 
EXO.6.13	Then 
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their father’s houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. 
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families of Simeon. 
EXO.6.16	These are the names of the sons of Levi ­according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
EXO.6.20	Amram married Jochebed, his father’s sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri. 
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba daughter of Amminadav, sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites. 
EXO.6.25	Eleazar, Aaron’s son, married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the ancestral houses of the Levites according to their families. 
EXO.6.26	These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom 
EXO.6.27	These are the ones that spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring 
EXO.6.28	So it happened on the day when 
EXO.6.29	that 
EXO.6.30	But Moses said to 
EXO.7.1	So 
EXO.7.2	You are to speak all that I command you and Aaron your brother is to speak to Pharaoh, so that he will let 
EXO.7.3	Yet I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and bring forth My armies, My people 
EXO.7.5	The Egyptians will know that I am 
EXO.7.6	So Moses and Aaron did as 
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
EXO.7.8	 told Moses and Aaron, 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh speaks to you saying, ‘Prove yourselves with a miracle,’ then you are to say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a serpent.’” 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and did as 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they too, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts. 
EXO.7.12	For each man threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 
EXO.7.13	Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. So he did not listen to them— just as 
EXO.7.14	Then 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is coming out to the water, and stand ready to meet him by the bank of the Nile. Take the staff that was transformed into a serpent in your hand. 
EXO.7.16	You are to say to him: 
EXO.7.17	This is what 
EXO.7.18	The fish that are in the river will die, the river will become foul, and the Egyptians will hate to drink water from the Nile.”’ 
EXO.7.19	 said to Moses, “Say to Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, over their pools and over all their ponds, so that they become blood. There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.” 
EXO.7.20	So Moses and Aaron did as 
EXO.7.21	When the fish that were in the river died, the river became so foul that the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. The blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them—just as 
EXO.7.23	Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and did not even take it to heart. 
EXO.7.24	So all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink of the water from the Nile. 
EXO.7.25	Seven days were fulfilled after 
EXO.7.26	 Then 
EXO.7.27	If you refuse to let them go, see, I will strike all your territory with frogs. 
EXO.7.28	The river will swarm with frogs. They will go up and enter your house, into your bedroom, upon your bed, into the houses of your servants, upon your people, into your ovens, and in your kneading bowls. 
EXO.7.29	The frogs will climb up on you, your people and all your servants.’”
EXO.8.1	Then 
EXO.8.2	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. 
EXO.8.3	But the magicians did the same with their secret arts and brought up frogs over the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.4	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to 
EXO.8.5	Moses answered Pharaoh, “Boast about me after I pray for you. When am I to pray for you, your servants and your people, that the frogs would be cut off from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile?” 
EXO.8.6	“Tomorrow,” he said. So he said, “Let it happen according to your word, so that you may know that there is none like 
EXO.8.7	The frogs will depart from you, from your houses, from your servants and from your people. They will remain only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.8	After Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, Moses cried out to 
EXO.8.9	So 
EXO.8.10	They piled them together in large heaps, and the land stank. 
EXO.8.11	But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them—just as 
EXO.8.12	So 
EXO.8.13	So they did. When Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, there were gnats on men and animals. All the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.14	When the magicians attempted the same with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, they could not. There were gnats on men and animals. 
EXO.8.15	So the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them—just as 
EXO.8.16	Then 
EXO.8.17	Or else, if you do not let My people go, I will send the swarm of flies on you and on your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of the swarm of flies including the ground that they stand on. 
EXO.8.18	“But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are dwelling—except no swarm of flies will be there—so that you may know that I, 
EXO.8.19	I will make a distinction between My people and your people. By tomorrow this sign will happen.” 
EXO.8.20	 did just so. A massive swarm of flies went into the house of Pharaoh and into his servant’s houses. All the land of Egypt was ruined because of the swarm of flies. 
EXO.8.21	So Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, “Go! Sacrifice to your God—in the land.” 
EXO.8.22	But Moses said, “That would not be right. For the offerings we intend to sacrifice to 
EXO.8.23	We must walk a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to 
EXO.8.24	Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, so that you may sacrifice to 
EXO.8.25	So Moses said, “See, I am leaving you, and I will pray to 
EXO.8.26	Then Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to 
EXO.8.27	 acted according to the word of Moses, and removed the swarm of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people. Nothing remained. 
EXO.8.28	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then 
EXO.9.2	For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still, 
EXO.9.3	behold, the hand of 
EXO.9.4	But 
EXO.9.5	Also 
EXO.9.6	Then the next day, 
EXO.9.7	When Pharaoh inquired, there was not so much as one of the cattle of 
EXO.9.8	Then 
EXO.9.9	It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils erupting with sores on both men and animals throughout all the land.” 
EXO.9.10	So they took soot from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. When Moses threw it heavenward, it became boils erupting with sores on both men and animals. 
EXO.9.11	Moreover, the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, because they were on the magicians, as on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	But 
EXO.9.13	Then 
EXO.9.14	For this time I will send all My plagues to your heart, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like Me in all the earth. 
EXO.9.15	Surely by now I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. 
EXO.9.16	However, I have let you stand for this reason: to show you My power, and that My Name might be proclaimed throughout all the earth. 
EXO.9.17	Yet still you exalt yourself over My people, by not letting them go. 
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow at about this time, I will cause it to rain a very severe hailstorm, the likes of which has not occurred in Egypt since the day it was founded until now. 
EXO.9.19	Send word, shelter your cattle and all that you have in the field. For every person and animal found in the field and not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, they will die.’” 
EXO.9.20	Whoever feared the word of 
EXO.9.21	but whoever disregarded the word of 
EXO.9.22	Then 
EXO.9.23	So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and 
EXO.9.24	The hail fell very severely, with fire flashing up amidst the hail, the likes of which had not occurred in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	The hail struck down everything that was in the fields, both men and animals, all throughout the land of Egypt. It also struck every plant of the field and broke down every tree. 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where 
EXO.9.27	So Pharaoh sent, called for Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time. 
EXO.9.28	Pray to 
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to 
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear 
EXO.9.31	(The flax and the barley were destroyed, because the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed, because they ripen later.) 
EXO.9.33	Moses went out of the city, away from Pharaoh, and stretched out his hands to 
EXO.9.34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail and the thunder had ceased, he increased his sin and hardened his heart, both he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he did not let 
EXO.10.1	Then 
EXO.10.2	and so you may tell your son and your grandchildren what I have done in Egypt, as well as My signs that I did among them, so you may know that I am 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what 
EXO.10.4	Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your borders. 
EXO.10.5	Then they will cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the ground. They will eat the remainder of what escaped—whatever is left from the hail—and eat every tree that grows for you out in the field. 
EXO.10.6	Your houses will be filled, as will the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they were on the earth until today!” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh. 
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Send the men, so they may serve 
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought to Pharaoh again. “Go, serve 
EXO.10.9	Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our elderly, our sons and our daughters. We will go with our flocks and our herds—for we must have 
EXO.10.10	But he said to them, “So may 
EXO.10.11	Not so! Go now—the men—and serve 
EXO.10.12	Then 
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and 
EXO.10.14	The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and rested on the entire territory of Egypt. So dense—there was nothing like it before them, nor will there ever be again. 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened, and they ate every plant in the land and all the fruit from the trees that the hail had left. No green thing remained, not a tree or a plant of the field throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against 
EXO.10.17	Now forgive my sin, only this once, please! So pray to 
EXO.10.18	So he went out from Pharaoh and prayed to 
EXO.10.19	Then 
EXO.10.20	But 
EXO.10.21	Then 
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	They could not see one another, nor could anyone rise from his place for three days. Yet all 
EXO.10.24	Pharaoh called Moses and said, “Go, serve 
EXO.10.25	But Moses said, “You must also put sacrifices and burnt offerings into our hand, then we will do it for 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle must also go with us—not a hoof may be left behind. We must take from them to serve 
EXO.10.27	But 
EXO.10.28	So Pharaoh said to him, “Go away from me! Take heed never to see my face again, because on the day you do, you will die!” 
EXO.10.29	“Right!” Moses said. “You said it! May I never see your face again!”
EXO.11.1	Now 
EXO.11.2	Speak now into the ears of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and gold.” 
EXO.11.3	 gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Indeed, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people. 
EXO.11.4	So Moses said, “This is what 
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die—from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant behind the mill, along with all the firstborn cattle. 
EXO.11.6	There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, the likes of which has never been before nor will ever be again. 
EXO.11.7	But not so much as a dog will growl against any of 
EXO.11.8	All these servants of yours will come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will go.” Then he went out from Pharaoh hot with anger. 
EXO.11.9	 had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” 
EXO.11.10	So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, yet 
EXO.12.1	Now 
EXO.12.2	“This month will mark the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you. 
EXO.12.3	Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family one lamb for the household. 
EXO.12.4	But if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor are to take one according to the number of the people. According to each person eating, you are to make your count for the lamb. 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb is to be without blemish, a year old male. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
EXO.12.6	You must watch over it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight. 
EXO.12.7	They are to take the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the crossbeam of the houses where they will eat it. 
EXO.12.8	They are to eat the meat that night, roasted over a fire. With 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of it raw or boiled with water, but only roasted with fire—its head with its legs and its innards. 
EXO.12.10	So let nothing of it remain until the morning. Whatever remains until the morning you are to burn with fire. 
EXO.12.11	Also you are to eat it this way: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in haste. It is 
EXO.12.12	“For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night and strike down every firstborn, both men and animals, and I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am 
EXO.12.13	The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. So there will be no plague among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. 
EXO.12.14	“This day is to be a memorial for you. You are to keep it as a feast to 
EXO.12.15	For seven days you are to eat 
EXO.12.16	The first day is to be a holy assembly for you as well as the seventh day. No manner of work is to be done on those days, except what is to be eaten by every person—that alone may be prepared by you. 
EXO.12.17	So you are to observe the Feast of Matzot, for on this very same day have I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you are to observe this day throughout your generations as an eternal ordinance. 
EXO.12.18	During the first month in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, you are to eat 
EXO.12.19	For seven days no 
EXO.12.20	You are to eat no 
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select lambs for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
EXO.12.22	You are to take a bundle of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply it to the crossbeam and two doorposts with the blood from the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning. 
EXO.12.23	 will pass through to strike down the Egyptians, but when He sees the blood on the crossbeam and the two doorposts, 
EXO.12.24	Also you are to observe this event as an eternal ordinance, for you and your children. 
EXO.12.25	“When you come into the land which 
EXO.12.26	 Now when it happens that your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ 
EXO.12.27	 You are to say, ‘It is the sacrifice of 
EXO.12.28	Then 
EXO.12.29	So it came about at midnight that 
EXO.12.30	Then Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt. For there was not a house where someone was not dead. 
EXO.12.31	So he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Rise up, go out from my people, both you and 
EXO.12.32	Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone! But bless me, too.” 
EXO.12.33	Now the Egyptians urged the people, sending them out of the land quickly, for they thought, “We will all be dead!” 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	So 
EXO.12.36	 gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians and let them have what they asked for. So they plundered the Egyptians. 
EXO.12.37	Then 
EXO.12.38	Also a mixed multitude went up with them, along with the flocks, herds and heavy livestock. 
EXO.12.39	They had baked 
EXO.12.40	Now the time that 
EXO.12.41	So it happened at the end of 430 years, to the very day, that all the armies of 
EXO.12.42	It was a night of watching for 
EXO.12.43	Then 
EXO.12.44	but every man’s servant that is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. 
EXO.12.45	Nor should a visitor or hired servant eat it. 
EXO.12.46	It is to be eaten inside a single house. You are not to carry the meat out of the house, nor are you to break any of its bones. 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel must keep it. 
EXO.12.48	But if an outsider dwells with you, who would keep the Passover for 
EXO.12.49	The same 
EXO.12.50	So all 
EXO.12.51	It was on that very day that 
EXO.13.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
EXO.13.2	“Consecrate to Me all the firstborn, from every womb of 
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, on which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage. For by a strong hand 
EXO.13.4	This day, in the month of Aviv, you are going out. 
EXO.13.5	When 
EXO.13.6	For seven days you are to eat 
EXO.13.7	Matzot is to be eaten throughout the seven days, and no 
EXO.13.8	“You are to tell your son on that day saying, ‘It is because of what 
EXO.13.9	So it will be like a sign on your hand and a reminder between your eyes, so that the 
EXO.13.10	You are to keep this ordinance as a 
EXO.13.11	“Now when 
EXO.13.12	you are to set apart to 
EXO.13.13	Every firstborn donkey you are to redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you are to break its neck. But you are to redeem every firstborn male among your sons. 
EXO.13.14	“So when your son asks you in times to come, ‘What is this?’ say to him, ‘By a strong hand 
EXO.13.15	and when Pharaoh refused to let us go, 
EXO.13.16	So it will be like a sign on your hand and like frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand 
EXO.13.17	After Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them along the road to the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby, for God said, “The people might change their minds if they see war and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds, and 
EXO.13.19	Moses also took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made 
EXO.13.20	So they journeyed from Succoth and encamped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	 went before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead the way and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light. So they could travel both day and night. 
EXO.13.22	The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never departed from the people.
EXO.14.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
EXO.14.2	“Speak to 
EXO.14.3	Pharaoh will say concerning 
EXO.14.4	I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so he will follow after them. Then I will be glorified over Pharaoh along with all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we let Israel go from serving us?” 
EXO.14.6	So he prepared his chariots and took his people with him. 
EXO.14.7	He took 600 of the finest chariots, along with all other chariots of Egypt, and captains over them. 
EXO.14.8	 hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so he pursued 
EXO.14.9	But the Egyptians pursued them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, as well as his charioteers and his army, and overtook them as they were encamped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth opposite Baal-zephon. 
EXO.14.10	When Pharaoh drew near, 
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses, “Have you taken us away to die in the wilderness because there were no graves in Egypt? Why have you dealt this way with us, to bring us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians?’ It was better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness!” 
EXO.14.13	But Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid! Stand still, and see the salvation of 
EXO.14.14	 will fight for you, while you hold your peace.” 
EXO.14.15	Then 
EXO.14.16	Lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it. Then 
EXO.14.17	Then I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them, so that I will be glorified over Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	Then the Egyptians will know that I am 
EXO.14.19	Then the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. Also the pillar of cloud moved from in front and stood behind them, 
EXO.14.20	and so came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel—there was the cloud and the darkness over here, yet it gave light by night over there—neither one came near the other all night long. 
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. 
EXO.14.22	Then 
EXO.14.23	But the Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.24	Now it came about during the morning watch that 
EXO.14.25	He took off their chariot wheels and caused them to drive heavily, so that the Egyptians said, “Get away from the presence of Israel! For 
EXO.14.26	Then 
EXO.14.27	So Moses stretched his hand out over the waters, and the sea returned to its strength at the break of dawn. The Egyptians were fleeing from it, but 
EXO.14.28	The waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen and the entire army of Pharaoh that went after them into the sea. Not one of them remained. 
EXO.14.29	But 
EXO.14.30	So 
EXO.14.31	When Israel saw the great work that 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and 
EXO.15.2	 is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will glorify Him, my father’s God, and I will exalt Him. 
EXO.15.3	 is a warrior—
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has hurled into the sea, and his chosen captains have sunk into the Sea of Reeds. 
EXO.15.5	The deeps cover them. They sank to the depths like a stone. 
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.7	In the greatness of Your excellency You overthrow those who resist You. You send forth Your wrath— it consumes them as stubble. 
EXO.15.8	With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps became firm ground in the heart of the sea. 
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My lust shall gorge on them! I will draw my sword— my hand will destroy them.” 
EXO.15.10	You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
EXO.15.11	Who is like You, 
EXO.15.12	You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them. 
EXO.15.13	You in Your lovingkindness led the people You have redeemed. You guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation. 
EXO.15.14	When the peoples hear, they will tremble—anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia. 
EXO.15.15	Then the chiefs of Edom are terrified. Trembling grips Moab’s mighty men. All of Canaan’s inhabitants will melt away. 
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread will fall on them. By the greatness of Your arm they become still as a stone, till Your people cross over, 
EXO.15.17	You bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place, 
EXO.15.18	 will reign forever and ever! 
EXO.15.19	For Pharaoh’s horses with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, but 
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing, 
EXO.15.21	as Miriam sang to them: Sing to 
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led Israel onward from the Sea of Reeds. They went out into the wilderness of Shur. But they travelled three days in the wilderness and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	When they came to Marah, they could not drink from the waters because they were bitter. On account of this it was called Marah. 
EXO.15.24	So the people complained to Moses saying, “What are we going to drink?” 
EXO.15.25	So he cried out to 
EXO.15.26	He said, “If you diligently listen to the voice of 
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. So they camped there by the waters.
EXO.16.1	They journeyed on from Elim, and the entire community of 
EXO.16.2	But the whole congregation of 
EXO.16.3	 said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of 
EXO.16.4	Then 
EXO.16.5	So on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather day by day.” 
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all 
EXO.16.7	and in the morning, then you will see the glory of 
EXO.16.8	Then Moses said, “
EXO.16.9	Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of 
EXO.16.10	Then, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of 
EXO.16.11	 spoke to Moses saying, 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the complaining of 
EXO.16.13	So when evening fell, quails came up and covered the camp. Moreover, in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the layer of dew was gone, on the surface of the desert was a thin, flake-like frost, as fine as the frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	When 
EXO.16.16	This is the word that 
EXO.16.17	 did so, and some gathered more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	When they measured it with an omer, those who gathered more had nothing left over, and those that gathered less did not lack at all. Every man gathered according to his appetite. 
EXO.16.19	Also Moses said to them, “Let no one save any of it until the morning.” 
EXO.16.20	However, they did not listen to Moses. Some of them preserved it until the morning—but it bred worms and rotted. So Moses was angry with them. 
EXO.16.21	So they gathered it morning by morning, each man according to his needs, and as the sun became hot it melted. 
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each individual. So all the leaders of the community came and informed Moses. 
EXO.16.23	But he said to them, “This is what 
EXO.16.24	So they set it aside until the morning, just as Moses instructed, and it did not rot nor were there any worms. 
EXO.16.25	Then Moses said, “Eat that today, because today is a 
EXO.16.26	You are to gather it for six days, but the seventh day is the Shabbat, and there will be none.” 
EXO.16.27	Yet on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather and they found none. 
EXO.16.28	 said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My 
EXO.16.29	See, 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day. 
EXO.16.31	The house of Israel named it 
EXO.16.32	Then Moses said, “This is what 
EXO.16.33	Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put a full omer of 
EXO.16.34	Just as 
EXO.16.35	 ate the 
EXO.16.36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
EXO.17.1	All the congregation of 
EXO.17.2	So the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test 
EXO.17.3	But the people thirsted for water there, and they complained against Moses and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt? To kill us with thirst, along with our children and cattle?” 
EXO.17.4	So Moses cried out to 
EXO.17.5	 said to Moses, “Walk before the people, and take of the elders of Israel with you, along with your staff with which you struck the river. Take it in your hand and go. 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before you, there upon the rock in Horeb. You are to strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people can drink.” Then Moses did just so in the eyes of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	The name of the place was called Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of 
EXO.17.8	Then the Amalekites came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men, go out, and fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses said, and fought the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. But when he let down his hand, the Amalekites prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	Moses’ hands grew heavy, so they took a stone, put it under him, and he sat down. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on each side. So his hands were steady until the sun went down. 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua overpowered the Amalekites and his army with the edge of the sword. 
EXO.17.14	 said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the hearing of Joshua, for I will utterly blot out the memory of the Amalekites from under heaven.” 
EXO.17.15	Then Moses built an altar, and called the name of it 
EXO.17.16	Then he said, “By the hand upon the throne of 
EXO.18.1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and Moses’ father-in-law, heard about everything God had done for Moses and for His people Israel, and how 
EXO.18.2	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken in Moses’ wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away 
EXO.18.3	with her two sons. One was named Gershom because he said, “I have been an outsider in a foreign land,” 
EXO.18.4	and the name of the other was Eliezer because he said, “For my father’s God is my help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”) 
EXO.18.5	So Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	He had told Moses, “I, Jethro your father-in-law, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons.” 
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, then bowed down and kissed him. They asked each other about their welfare, and went into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law all that 
EXO.18.9	Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness that 
EXO.18.10	Jethro said, “Blessed be 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that 
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, presented a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. Aaron also came along with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God. 
EXO.18.13	The next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and they stood around Moses from morning till evening. 
EXO.18.14	When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What’s this you’re doing to the people? Why sit by yourself, alone, with all the people standing around from morning until evening?” 
EXO.18.15	Moses answered his father-in-law, “It’s because the people come to me to inquire of God. 
EXO.18.16	When they have an issue, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, so I make them understand God’s statutes and His laws.” 
EXO.18.17	But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you’re doing is no good. 
EXO.18.18	You will surely wear yourself out, as well as these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You cannot do it alone, by yourself. 
EXO.18.19	Now listen to my voice—I will give you advice, and may God be with you! You, represent the people before God, and bring their cases to God. 
EXO.18.20	Enlighten them as to the statutes and the laws, and show them the way by which they must walk and the work they must do. 
EXO.18.21	But you should seek out capable men out of all the people—men who fear God, men of truth, who hate bribery. Appoint them to be rulers over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
EXO.18.22	Let them judge the people all the time. Then let every major case be brought to you, but every minor case they can judge for themselves. Make it easier for yourself, as they bear the burden with you. 
EXO.18.23	If you do this thing as God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people will go to their places in 
EXO.18.24	So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
EXO.18.25	Moses chose capable men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
EXO.18.26	They judged the people all the time. The hard cases they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
EXO.18.27	Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went on his way to his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month after 
EXO.19.2	They travelled from Rephidim, came into to the wilderness of Sinai, and set up camp in the wilderness. Israel camped there, right in front of the mountain. 
EXO.19.3	Moses went up to God, and 
EXO.19.4	‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagle’s wings and brought you to Myself. 
EXO.19.5	Now then, if you listen closely to My voice, and keep My covenant, then you will be My own treasure from among all people, for all the earth is Mine. 
EXO.19.6	So as for you, you will be to Me a kingdom of 
EXO.19.7	So Moses went, called for the elders of the people, and put before them all these words that 
EXO.19.8	All the people answered together and said, “Everything that 
EXO.19.9	 said to Moses, “I am about to come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.” Then Moses told the words of the people to 
EXO.19.10	 said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow. Let them wash their clothing. 
EXO.19.11	Be ready for the third day. For on the third day 
EXO.19.12	You are to set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Be very careful not to go up onto the mountain, or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death. 
EXO.19.13	Not a hand is to touch it, but he will surely be stoned or shot through. Whether it is an animal or a man, it will not live.’ When the 
EXO.19.14	Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, consecrated them, and then, they washed their clothing. 
EXO.19.15	He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not draw near your wives.” 
EXO.19.16	In the morning of the third day, there was thundering and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and the blast of an exceedingly loud 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the lowest part of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	Now the entire Mount Sinai was in smoke, because 
EXO.19.19	When the sound of the 
EXO.19.20	Then 
EXO.19.21	Then 
EXO.19.22	Even the 
EXO.19.23	Moses said to 
EXO.19.24	Then 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them.
EXO.20.1	Then God spoke all these words saying, 
EXO.20.2	“I am 
EXO.20.3	“You shall have no other gods before Me. 
EXO.20.4	Do not make for yourself a graven image , or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth below or in the water under the earth. 
EXO.20.5	Do not bow down to them, do not let anyone make you serve them. For I, 
EXO.20.6	but showing lovingkindness to the thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My 
EXO.20.7	“You must not take the Name of 
EXO.20.8	“Remember Yom Shabbat, to keep it holy. 
EXO.20.9	You are to work six days, and do all your work, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a 
EXO.20.11	For in six days 
EXO.20.12	“Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long upon the land which 
EXO.20.13	“Do not murder. 
EXO.20.14	“Do not commit adultery. 
EXO.20.15	“Do not steal. 
EXO.20.16	“Do not bear false witness against your neighbor. 
EXO.20.17	“Do not covet your neighbor’s house, your neighbor’s wife, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.” 
EXO.20.18	All the people witnessed the thundering and the lightning, and the sound of the 
EXO.20.19	So they said to Moses, “You, speak to us, and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.” 
EXO.20.20	So Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that His fear may be in you, so that you do not sin.” 
EXO.20.21	The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was. 
EXO.20.22	Then 
EXO.20.23	Do not make gods of silver alongside Me, and do not make gods of gold for yourselves. 
EXO.20.24	You are to make an altar of earth for Me, and there you will sacrifice your burnt offerings, your fellowship offerings—your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you. 
EXO.20.25	When you make for Me an altar of stones, do not build it from cut stone, for if you use a tool on it, you will have profaned it. 
EXO.20.26	Nor are you to go up to My altar on steps, so that your nakedness would not be uncovered while on it.”
EXO.21.1	“Now these are the ordinances which you will set before them. 
EXO.21.2	“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve for six years, and in the seventh he is to go free, without payment. 
EXO.21.3	If he comes in by himself, he is to go out by himself. If he was married, then his wife will go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gave him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will be her master’s, and he will go free by himself. 
EXO.21.5	“But if the servant plainly states, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children, and I will not go out free,’ 
EXO.21.6	then his master is to bring him to God, then take him to a door or to a doorpost. His master is to pierce his ear through with an awl, and he will serve him forever. 
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant, she is not to go free as the male servants do. 
EXO.21.8	If she does not please her master who has selected her for himself, then he is to allow her to be redeemed. He will have no power to sell her to a foreign people, seeing as he has dealt deceitfully toward her. 
EXO.21.9	If he betroths her to his son, he must give her the rights of a daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If he takes another wife, he is not to diminish her food, her clothing, or her marriage rights. 
EXO.21.11	If he does not provide these three to her, then she is to go free without payment. 
EXO.21.12	“Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.13	But if he did not hunt him down, yet God caused it to happen, then I will appoint for you a place where he may run. 
EXO.21.14	If a man presumes to kill his neighbor with craftiness, you are to take him from My altar and put him to death. 
EXO.21.15	“Anyone who strikes his father or his mother must surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.16	“Anyone who steals a person and sells him, or is found with him under his hand, must surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.17	“Whoever curses his father or his mother must surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.18	“If people quarrel, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and the other does not die but lies in bed, 
EXO.21.19	if he rises again and walks around on his staff, then the one that struck him he will be cleared. But he must pay for the loss of his time and help him to be thoroughly healed. 
EXO.21.20	“If a man strikes his male or female servant with a staff, who dies by his hand, he must surely be punished. 
EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if the servant gets up in a day or two he will not be punished, for he is his property. 
EXO.21.22	“If men fight, and hit a pregnant woman so that her child is born early, yet no harm follows, the one who hit her is to be strictly fined, according to what the woman’s husband demands of him. He must pay as the judges determine. 
EXO.21.23	But if any harm follows, then you are to penalize life for life, 
EXO.21.24	eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burn for burn, wound for wound, blow for blow. 
EXO.21.26	“If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave and destroys it, he must let him go free for the sake of his eyesight. 
EXO.21.27	If he strikes out his slave’s tooth, he must let him go free for the sake of his tooth. 
EXO.21.28	“If an ox gores a man or a woman so that they die, the ox must surely be stoned, and its meat is not to be eaten, but the owner of the ox will be cleared. 
EXO.21.29	If the ox was given to goring in times past, and a warning has been given to its owner, yet he has not kept it pent up, and it has killed a man or a woman, then the ox must be stoned and its owner must also be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	If instead a ransom is placed on him, then he is to pay for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded. 
EXO.21.31	Whether it has gored a son or daughter, this rule is to be applied to him. 
EXO.21.32	If the ox gores a male or female slave, he is to pay 30 shekels of silver to their master, and the ox is to be stoned. 
EXO.21.33	“If one uncovers a pit or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls in, 
EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit must pay compensation. He is to give money to the owner, and the dead animal will be his. 
EXO.21.35	“If one man’s ox hurts another’s ox so that it dies, they are to sell the live ox and divide the price. They are also to divide the dead one. 
EXO.21.36	Or if it becomes known that the ox was given to violence in times past, and its owner has not kept it pent up, he must surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his own. 
EXO.21.37	 If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he is to pay five oxen for one ox or four sheep for one sheep.
EXO.22.1	“If a thief found breaking in is struck so that he dies, there is no bloodguilt for him. 
EXO.22.2	But if the sun has risen, there is bloodguilt, and he is to make full restitution. If he has nothing, then he must be sold for his theft. 
EXO.22.3	If the item is found in his hand alive—whether ox, donkey or sheep—he is to pay double. 
EXO.22.4	“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten by letting his animal loose, and it feeds in another man’s field, then he is to make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard. 
EXO.22.5	“If fire breaks out and spreads among thorns, so that stalks of grain, standing grain or the fields themselves are consumed, then the one who lit the fire must make full restitution. 
EXO.22.6	“If a man entrusts his neighbor with money or items for safekeeping, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, when the thief is found, he must pay double. 
EXO.22.7	If the thief is not found, then the master of the house is to present himself to God, to see whether he has laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods. 
EXO.22.8	For any transgression—whether ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or anything else lost—when someone says, ‘This is mine!’ the case of both parties is to be brought before God. The one whom God convicts is to pay double to his neighbor. 
EXO.22.9	“If a man entrusts his neighbor with a donkey, ox, sheep or any animal to care for, and it dies, is hurt or taken away with no one seeing, 
EXO.22.10	then there must be an oath before 
EXO.22.11	But if indeed it was stolen from him, he is to make restitution to the owner. 
EXO.22.12	If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it as evidence. He is not required to pay for what has been torn to pieces. 
EXO.22.13	“If a man borrows anything belonging to his neighbor, and it is harmed or dies in the absence of the owner, he must make full restitution. 
EXO.22.14	But if the owner is present, he is not required to pay restitution. If it was rented, it is covered by the rental fee. 
EXO.22.15	“If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 
EXO.22.16	But if her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he must weigh out silver equal to the dowry for virgins. 
EXO.22.17	“You must not permit a sorceress to live. 
EXO.22.18	“Anyone who lies with an animal must surely be put to death. 
EXO.22.19	“Anyone who sacrifices to the gods, except to 
EXO.22.20	“You must not exploit or oppress an outsider, for you were outsiders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.22.21	“You must not mistreat any widow or orphan. 
EXO.22.22	If you mistreat them in any way, and they cry out to Me, I will surely hear their cry. 
EXO.22.23	My wrath will burn hot, and I will kill you with the sword. So your wives will become widows and your children will become orphans. 
EXO.22.24	“If you lend money to any of My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act like a debt collector with him, and you are not to charge him interest. 
EXO.22.25	If you ever take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun goes down, 
EXO.22.26	for that is his only covering, his cloak for his skin. What will he sleep in? When he cries out to Me I will hear, because I am gracious. 
EXO.22.27	“Do not despise God, or curse a ruler of your people. 
EXO.22.28	“Do not hold back the fullness of your crops or your vintage. You are to present the firstborn of your sons to Me. 
EXO.22.29	“Do the same with your cattle and with your sheep. For seven days it is to be with its mother, and on the eighth day you are to give it to Me. 
EXO.22.30	“You are to be a holy people for Me. You must not eat any flesh torn by beasts in the field. You may throw it out to the dogs.
EXO.23.1	“Do not to spread a false report. Do not join hands with the wicked by becoming a malicious witness. 
EXO.23.2	“Do not follow a crowd to do evil. Nor are you to testify in a case, to follow a crowd and pervert justice. 
EXO.23.3	On the other hand, nor should you takes sides with a poor man in his case. 
EXO.23.4	“If you find your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you must surely bring it back to him again. 
EXO.23.5	If you see the donkey of the one that hates you lying down under its burden, do not leave it. Rather, you are to release it with him. 
EXO.23.6	“You are not to pervert justice to your poor in his dispute. 
EXO.23.7	Stay far away from a false charge. Do not kill the innocent and the righteous, for I will not justify the guilty. 
EXO.23.8	Take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have sight, and perverts the words of the righteous. 
EXO.23.9	“Do not oppress an outsider, for you know the heart of an outsider, since you were outsiders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.23.10	“For six years you are to sow your land and gather the increase. 
EXO.23.11	But during the seventh year you are to let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat. Whatever they leave behind, the animals of the field may eat. You are to deal with your vineyard and your olive grove in the same way. 
EXO.23.12	“You are to do your work for six days, but on the seventh day you will rest, so that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and also the son of your handmaid and the outsider may be refreshed. 
EXO.23.13	“With all the things that I have said to you, take heed. Make no mention of the names of other gods, and do not let them be heard in your mouth.
EXO.23.14	“Three times in the year you are to ce­lebrate a festival for Me. 
EXO.23.15	You are to observe the Feast of Matzot. For seven days you will eat 
EXO.23.16	Also you are to observe the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors that you sow in the field, as well as the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your crops from the field. 
EXO.23.17	Three times in the year all your men are to appear before 
EXO.23.18	“Do not offer the blood of My sacrifice with 
EXO.23.19	Bring the choicest firstfruits of your land into the House of

EXO.23.21	Watch for Him and listen to His voice. Do not rebel against Him because He will not pardon your transgression, for My Name is in Him. 
EXO.23.22	But if you listen closely to His voice, and do everything I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. 
EXO.23.23	For My angel will go before you, and bring you to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and the Jebusites, and I will cut them off. 
EXO.23.24	You are not to bow down to their gods or serve them, or do what they do. Rather, you are to utterly overthrow them, and break their pillars in pieces. 
EXO.23.25	You are to serve 
EXO.23.26	None will miscarry nor be barren in your land, and I will fill up the number of your days. 
EXO.23.27	“I will send My terror before you and throw all the people to whom you will come into panic, and make all your enemies turn their backs to you. 
EXO.23.28	I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites and the Hittites, from before you. 
EXO.23.29	I will not drive them out from before you in a single year. Otherwise the land would become desolate, and the animals of the field will multiply against you. 
EXO.23.30	But little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you are fruitful. Then you will possess the land. 
EXO.23.31	“I will set your border from the Sea of Reeds to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you are to drive them out before you. 
EXO.23.32	Make no covenant with them or with their gods. 
EXO.23.33	They must not dwell in your land and cause you to sin against Me, for if you worship their gods, they will be a snare to you.”
EXO.24.1	Then to Moses He said, “Come up to 
EXO.24.2	Moses alone is to approach 
EXO.24.3	So Moses came and told the people all the words of

EXO.24.7	He took the Scroll of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. Again they said, “All that

EXO.24.9	Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up. 
EXO.24.10	They saw the God of Israel, and under His feet was something like a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the very heavens. 
EXO.24.11	Yet He did not raise His hand against the nobles of 
EXO.24.12	Then 
EXO.24.13	So Moses rose up along with his attendant Joshua, and Moses went up onto the mountain of God. 
EXO.24.14	To the elders he said, “Wait for us here until we come back to you. See, Aaron and Hur are with you—whoever has a dispute should go to them.” 
EXO.24.15	When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it.

EXO.25.2	“Tell 
EXO.25.3	These are the contributions which you are to receive from them: gold, silver and bronze; 
EXO.25.4	blue, purple and scarlet cloth; fine linen and goat hair; 
EXO.25.5	ram skins dyed red, sealskins, acacia wood; 
EXO.25.6	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense; 
EXO.25.7	onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastplate. 
EXO.25.8	“Have them make a Sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them. 
EXO.25.9	You are to make it all precisely according to everything that I show you—the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the furnishings within—just so you must make it. 
EXO.25.10	“Now they are to make an Ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits in length, one and a half cubits wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
EXO.25.11	You are to overlay it with pure gold, inside and out, and make a crown of gold around it. 
EXO.25.12	You are to cast four rings of gold for it, and place them in its four feet. Two rings will be on one side, and two rings on the other side. 
EXO.25.13	Also make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.25.14	You are to put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark, in order to carry the Ark. 
EXO.25.15	The poles are to remain in the rings of the Ark, and not be taken from it. 
EXO.25.16	You are to put the Testimony, which I will give you, into the Ark. 
EXO.25.17	“Then you are to make an atonement cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long, one cubit and a half wide.

EXO.25.25	Make a border a single handwidth wide around it and a golden crown for the border all around. 
EXO.25.26	Also make four gold rings for it, and put the rings in the four corners that are on its four feet. 
EXO.25.27	The rings are to be close to the borders, as holders for the poles to carry the table.

EXO.31.1	Then 
EXO.31.2	“See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
EXO.31.3	and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship, 
EXO.31.4	to make ingenious designs, to forge with gold, silver and bronze, 
EXO.31.5	as well as cutting stones for setting and carving wood, to work in all manner of craftsmanship. 
EXO.31.6	Also look, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. Within the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed skill, so that they may make everything that I have commanded you:

EXO.31.11	the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place. They are to make them just as how I commanded you.”
EXO.31.12	Then 
EXO.31.13	“Speak now to 
EXO.31.14	Therefore you are to keep the Shabbat, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it will die, for whoever does any work during Shabbat, that soul will be cut off from the midst of his people. 
EXO.31.15	Work is to be done for six days, but on the seventh day is a 
EXO.31.16	So 
EXO.31.17	It is a sign between Me and 
EXO.31.18	When He had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave the two tablets of the Testimony to Moses—tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
EXO.32.1	Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Get up, make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what’s become of him!” 
EXO.32.2	So Aaron said to them, “Break off the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters, and bring them to me.” 
EXO.32.3	So all the people broke off the golden rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	He received them from their hand, and made a molten calf, fashioned with a chiseling tool. Then they said, “This is your god, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” 
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. Then Aaron made a proclamation saying, “Tomorrow will be a feast to

EXO.32.7	Then 
EXO.32.8	They quickly turned aside from the path that I commanded for them. They have made a molten calf, worshipped it, and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’” 
EXO.32.9	 said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people. 
EXO.32.10	Now therefore, leave Me alone, so My wrath may burn hot against them, and so I may consume them—and make from you a great nation!” 
EXO.32.11	Then Moses sought 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out to do evil, to slay them in the mountains, and to annihilate them from the face of the earth?’ Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this destruction against Your people. 
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they will inherit it forever.’” 
EXO.32.14	So 
EXO.32.15	Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides, on one and on the other. 
EXO.32.16	The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. 
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war within the camp.” 
EXO.32.18	But Moses said: “It is not the voice of a shout of victory, nor is it the voice of crying from defeat, but I hear the sound of singing.” 
EXO.32.19	Then it happened, as soon as Moses came near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing, and his anger burned hot. So he threw the tablets out of his hands, and smashed them at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	Then he took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the surface of the water and made 
EXO.32.21	Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, to make you bring such a great sin upon them?” 
EXO.32.22	Aaron said, “Don’t be angry, my lord! You know these people yourself, and how they are set on evil. 
EXO.32.23	They said to me, ‘Make gods for us, to go before us! As for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what happened to him.’ 
EXO.32.24	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them break it off.’ So they gave it to me and I threw it into the fire—and out came this calf!” 
EXO.32.25	When Moses saw that the people were unrestrained, because Aaron had let them run wild, to become a joke among their enemies, 
EXO.32.26	Moses stood at the gate of the camp and said, “Whoever is on 
EXO.32.27	He said to them, “This is what 
EXO.32.28	So the sons of Levi did as Moses said, and that day from among the people there fell about 3,000 men. 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said, “Consecrate your hands today to 
EXO.32.30	So it happened the following day, Moses said to the people, “You have committed a horrendous sin. So now I will go up to 
EXO.32.31	Then Moses returned to 
EXO.32.32	Yet now, please forgive their sin. But if not, please blot me out of Your book that You have written.” 
EXO.32.33	 said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book. 
EXO.32.34	Now go, lead the people to the place that I told you about. My angel will go before you. Nevertheless, on the day when I take account, I will hold them accountable for their sin.” 
EXO.32.35	So 
EXO.33.1	Then 
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel before you. I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and the Jebusites. 
EXO.33.3	Head up into a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not move within the midst of you, so that I do not destroy you along the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.” 
EXO.33.4	When the people heard these dreadful words, they mourned, and no one put on any ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	 said to Moses, “Say to 
EXO.33.6	So 
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the Tent of Meeting. So it happened, everyone who sought 
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would arise and stand, everyone at the door of his own tent, and look after Moses, until he had gone into the Tent. 
EXO.33.9	After Moses entered, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door, and He would speak with Moses. 
EXO.33.10	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the Tent, they all rose up and worshipped, every man at the entrance of his own tent. 
EXO.33.11	So 
EXO.33.12	So Moses said to 
EXO.33.13	Now then, I pray, if I have found grace in Your eyes, show me Your ways, so that I may know You, so that I might find favor in Your sight. Consider also that this nation is Your people.” 
EXO.33.14	“My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest,” He answered. 
EXO.33.15	But then he said to Him, “If Your presence does not go with me, don’t let us go up from here! 
EXO.33.16	For how would it be known that I or your people have found favor in Your sight? Isn’t it because You go with us, that distinguishes us from all the people on the face of the earth?” 
EXO.33.17	 answered Moses, “I will also do what you have said, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.” 
EXO.33.18	Then he said, “Please, show me Your glory!” 
EXO.33.19	So He said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass before you, and call out the Name of 
EXO.33.20	But He also said, “You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live.” 
EXO.33.21	Then 
EXO.33.22	While My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and cover you with My hand, until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take away My hand, and you will see My back, but My face will not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	 said to Moses, “Carve for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write upon them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
EXO.34.2	Be ready by the morning, come up to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No one is to come up with you, and do not let anyone be seen throughout the entire mountain. Even the flocks and herds must not graze in front of that mountain.” 
EXO.34.4	So he carved two tablets of stone like the first. Then Moses rose up early in the morning, went up onto Mount Sinai as 
EXO.34.5	Then 
EXO.34.6	Then 
EXO.34.7	showing mercy to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, yet by no means leaving the guilty unpunished, but bringing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, to the third and fourth generation.” 
EXO.34.8	Then Moses quickly bowed his head down to the earth and worshipped. 
EXO.34.9	 He said, “If now I have found grace in Your eyes, my Lord, let my Lord please go within our midst, even though this is a stiff-necked people. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own inheritance.”
EXO.34.10	Then He said, “I am cutting a covenant. Before all your people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, or in any nation. All the people you are among will see the work of 
EXO.34.11	Obey what I am commanding you today. Behold, I am going to drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites before you. 
EXO.34.12	Watch yourself, and make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, or they will become a snare among you. 
EXO.34.13	Instead you must break down their ­altars, smash their pillars and cut down their Asherah poles. 
EXO.34.14	For you are to bow down to no other god, because 
EXO.34.15	“See that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land. Otherwise when they prostitute themselves with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone will invite you, and you will eat from their sacrifice. 
EXO.34.16	Do not take their daughters for your sons, for their daughters will prostitute themselves with their own gods, and cause your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods. 
EXO.34.17	“You are not to make for yourselves metal gods. 
EXO.34.18	“You are to keep the Feast of Matzot. For seven days you are eat 
EXO.34.19	“Every firstborn of the womb is Mine, and from all your cattle you are to sanctify the males, the firstborn of the ox and sheep. 
EXO.34.20	A firstborn donkey you are to redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you are to break its neck. You must redeem all your firstborn sons. No one should appear before Me empty-handed. 
EXO.34.21	“For six days you will work, but on the seventh day you will rest. During plowing time and harvest you must rest. 
EXO.34.22	“You are to observe the Feast of 
EXO.34.23	Three times during the year all your males are to appear before 
EXO.34.24	For I am going to cast out nations before you, then enlarge your territory. So no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before 
EXO.34.25	“You are not to offer the blood of My sacrifice with 
EXO.34.26	“You are to bring the choicest firstfruits of your land to the House of 
EXO.34.27	Then 
EXO.34.28	So he stayed there with 
EXO.34.29	Now it happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand when he came down from the mountain, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant, because God had spoken with him. 
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and all 
EXO.34.31	But Moses called out to them, so Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all 
EXO.34.33	When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
EXO.34.34	But when Moses went before 
EXO.34.35	 saw the face of Moses and that the skin of his face glistened. So Moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with Him.
EXO.35.1	Then Moses assembled all the congregation of 
EXO.35.2	Work is to be done for six days, but the seventh day is a holy day for you, a 
EXO.35.3	Do not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on Yom Shabbat.” 
EXO.35.4	Moses also said to all the congregation of 
EXO.35.5	Take from among you an offering for 
EXO.35.6	blue, purple and scarlet cloth; fine linen and goat hair; 
EXO.35.7	ram skins dyed red, sealskins and acacia wood; 
EXO.35.8	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense; 
EXO.35.9	onyx stones, and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastplate. 
EXO.35.10	“Let every wise-hearted man among you come and make everything that 
EXO.35.11	the Tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its clasps and its boards, its crossbars, its pillars and its bases; 
EXO.35.12	the Ark and the poles, the atonement cover and the curtain screen; 
EXO.35.13	the table and its poles with all of its utensils, along with the bread of the Presence; 
EXO.35.14	also the 
EXO.35.15	the altar of incense and its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the screen for the entrance of the Tabernacle; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering with its grating of bronze, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand; 
EXO.35.17	the hangings of the courtyard, the pillars and their bases, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard; 
EXO.35.18	the pegs of the Tabernacle and of the courtyard, along with their cords; 
EXO.35.19	the woven garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the 
EXO.35.20	Then all the congregation of 
EXO.35.21	Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit was willing came and brought 
EXO.35.22	So they came, both men and women, everyone whose heart compelled him, and brought nose rings, earrings, signet rings, bracelets, and all kinds of golden jewels—everyone who brought a wave offering of gold to 
EXO.35.23	Everyone who had blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red or sealskins brought them. 
EXO.35.24	Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought 
EXO.35.25	Also all the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought what they had woven—the blue, purple, scarlet and fine linen. 
EXO.35.26	All the women whose heart stirred them up with wisdom spun the goat hair. 
EXO.35.27	Also the leaders brought onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastplate, 
EXO.35.28	along with the spice, the oil for the light and for anointing and for the sweet incense. 
EXO.35.29	Every man and woman whose heart made them willing gave toward all the work that 
EXO.35.30	Then Moses said to 
EXO.35.31	He has filled him with the 
EXO.35.32	to make ingenious designs, to work in gold, silver and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	as well as cutting gemstones for setting, wood carving, to make all kinds of skillful craftsmanship. 
EXO.35.34	He has also placed in his heart the ability to teach—both he and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with wisdom of heart to forge all the works of an engraver, an artisan, and an embroiderer in blue, purple, scarlet and in fine linen, as well as weaving—they can perform every craft and ingenious designs.
EXO.36.1	“So Bezalel and Oholiab are to work, along with every wise-hearted man in whom 
EXO.36.2	Then Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab and all the wise-hearted men in whose minds 
EXO.36.3	They received from Moses the entire offering that 
EXO.36.4	Then all the skilled men who were doing all the work of the Sanctuary came, one by one from the work he was doing, 
EXO.36.5	and said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for the work of this construction that 
EXO.36.6	So Moses gave an order, and they proclaimed it throughout the camp saying, “Let neither man nor woman make anything else as an offering for the Sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing more. 
EXO.36.7	For the work material they had was sufficient for all the work, with much left over. 
EXO.36.8	So all the wise-hearted men among them did the work. They made the Tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen, along with blue, purple and scarlet, with 
EXO.36.9	The length of each curtain was 28 cubits and the width of each curtain was four cubits. All the curtains had one measure. 
EXO.36.10	Then he coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he also coupled together. 
EXO.36.11	He made blue loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost within the first set. He did the same along the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. 
EXO.36.12	He made 50 loops in one curtain and 50 loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set, so that the loops were opposite to one another. 
EXO.36.13	Also he made 50 clasps of gold and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps, so the Tabernacle was one. 
EXO.36.14	Then he made curtains from goat hair for a tent over the Tabernacle. He made 11 curtains. 
EXO.36.15	The length of each curtain was 30 cubits, and the width of each was four cubits. The 11 curtains had one measure. 
EXO.36.16	He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six other curtains by themselves. 
EXO.36.17	He made 50 loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the first set and 50 loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. 
EXO.36.18	Also he made 50 bronze clasps to couple the tent together, so that it would be one. 
EXO.36.19	Then he made a covering for the tent of ram skins, dyed red, along with a covering of sealskins above. 
EXO.36.20	He also made the framework of boards for the Tabernacle from acacia wood, standing upright. 
EXO.36.21	The length of a board was ten cubits, the width was a cubit and a half. 
EXO.36.22	Each board had two supports, joined one to another. He did this for all the boards of the Tabernacle. 
EXO.36.23	So he built the boards for the Tabernacle, 20 boards from the south side southward. 
EXO.36.24	And he made 40 silver bases under the 20 boards, two bases under one board for its two supports, and two bases under another board for its two supports. 
EXO.36.25	Also for the second side of the Tabernacle, on the north side, he made 20 boards, 
EXO.36.26	along with their 40 silver bases, two under one board and two under the next. 
EXO.36.27	For the back part of the Tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
EXO.36.28	He also made two boards for the corners of the Tabernacle in the back, 
EXO.36.29	so that they could be doubled underneath, and in same way to be fixed to the top, at the first ring. He did this for both of them at the two corners. 
EXO.36.30	So there were eight boards, along with their silver bases, 16 in all, two under each board. 
EXO.36.31	Then he made crossbars from acacia wood, five for the boards on one side of the Tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	five for the boards on the other side of the Tabernacle, and five crossbars for the boards of the Tabernacle for the back part, westward. 
EXO.36.33	He built the middle crossbar to pass through, in the center of the boards, from one end to the other. 
EXO.36.34	He overlaid the boards with gold and made golden rings for them, as holders for the crossbars, and overlaid the crossbars with gold. 
EXO.36.35	Then he made the curtain of blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen, along with the 
EXO.36.36	He made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold, having golden hooks, and he cast four silver bases for them. 
EXO.36.37	Then he made a 
EXO.36.38	Also he made the five pillars with their hooks, and overlaid their capitals and bands with gold, along with their five bronze bases.
EXO.37.1	Bezalel also made the Ark from acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
EXO.37.2	He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a crown of gold for it all around. 
EXO.37.3	He cast four golden rings for it, in the four feet, two rings on the one side, and two on the other. 
EXO.37.4	He also made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	Then he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark, to carry the Ark. 
EXO.37.6	He made an atonement cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide. 
EXO.37.7	Then he forged two 
EXO.37.8	one 
EXO.37.9	So the 
EXO.37.10	Then he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
EXO.37.11	He overlaid it with pure gold and made a golden crown all around. 
EXO.37.12	Also he made a border for it, a hand-width around, and made a golden crown for the border all around. 
EXO.37.13	He cast four golden rings for it, and put the rings into the four corners that were on the four feet. 
EXO.37.14	The rings were close to the borders, as holders for the poles to carry the table. 
EXO.37.15	He also made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. 
EXO.37.16	He forged the articles that were on the table, the dishes, pans, bowls and jars, with which to pour, out of pure gold. 
EXO.37.17	Then he made the 
EXO.37.18	There were six branches going out of the sides, three branches out of one side, and three branches out of the other. 
EXO.37.19	Three cups made like almond blossoms were in one branch, a bulb within a flower, and three cups made like almond blossoms in the next branch, another bulb within a flower. It was just so for the six branches going out of the 
EXO.37.20	Also within the 
EXO.37.21	with a bulb under two branches of one piece, a second bulb under two branches of another piece, and a bulb under two branches of a third piece, for six branches extending out of it. 
EXO.37.22	Their bulbs and their branches were one piece with it, an entire hammered work of pure gold. 
EXO.37.23	He also made the seven lamps, along with tongs and censers of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	He made them from a talent of pure gold, along with all the pieces. 
EXO.37.25	He made the altar of incense from acacia wood, a cubit long, a cubit wide, squared, and two cubits high. The horns were one piece with it. 
EXO.37.26	Then he overlaid it with pure gold on top, on the sides all around and over its horns. Also he made a crown of gold for it all around. 
EXO.37.27	He made two golden rings for it underneath the crown, on two sides as holders for poles in order to carry it. 
EXO.37.28	He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.29	Then he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, the blend of a perfumer.
EXO.38.1	He then made the altar for burnt offering from acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
EXO.38.2	He also made the horns on the four corners from one piece, and overlaid it with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	Then he made all the utensils for the altar—the pots and the shovels, the basins, the forks and the fire pans. He made all the utensils from bronze. 
EXO.38.4	He also made a bronze grating net for the altar, under the ledge around it, reaching halfway up. 
EXO.38.5	He cast four rings for the four ends of the bronze grating, to be holders for the poles. 
EXO.38.6	He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	Then he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it, and he made it hollow, out of boards. 
EXO.38.8	He made the basin and the base from bronze, with mirrors from the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
EXO.38.9	Then he made the courtyard. For the south side the hangings of the courtyard were finely twisted linen, 100 cubits long. 
EXO.38.10	There were 20 pillars and 20 bronze bases. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver. 
EXO.38.11	Likewise, for the north side, 100 cubits long, with 20 bronze pillars and bases, and the hooks for the pillars and their bands were silver. 
EXO.38.12	For the west side the hangings were 50 cubits, with ten pillars and their ten bases, as well as the hooks for the pillars and their silver bands. 
EXO.38.13	Likewise, for the east side, 50 cubits long. 
EXO.38.14	The hangings for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with three pillars and their bases. 
EXO.38.15	Similarly for the other side, on either side of the gate of the courtyard were hangings of 15 cubits, with their three pillars and three bases. 
EXO.38.16	All the hangings of the courtyard all around were of finely twisted linen. 
EXO.38.17	The bases for the pillars were bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver, the overlaying of their capitals were silver, and all the pillars of the courtyard were ringed with silver. 
EXO.38.18	The curtain for the gate of the courtyard was the work of a color weaver, of blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen. It was 20 cubits long and five cubits high, like the hangings of the courtyard. 
EXO.38.19	Their four pillars and four bases were bronze. Their hooks along with the overlaying of their capitals and their bands were silver. 
EXO.38.20	All the pegs of the Tabernacle and the courtyard all around were bronze.
EXO.38.21	These are the accounts of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were recorded according to the commandment of Moses, by the service of the Levites, under the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the 
EXO.38.22	Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur of the tribe of Judah made all that 
EXO.38.23	Along with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman, a skillful workman, and a weaver of colors, in blue, purple, scarlet and fine linen. 
EXO.38.24	The entirety of the gold that was used for the work of the Sanctuary, including the gold of the offering, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the Sanctuary shekel. 
EXO.38.25	The silver from those numbered from the congregation was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the Sanctuary shekel—
EXO.38.26	that is, a beka, or half a shekel per head, according to the shekel of the Sanctuary, for everyone who was recorded, from 20 years old and upward, for 603,550 men. 
EXO.38.27	The 100 talents of silver were for casting the bases of the Sanctuary, and the bases for the inner curtain, 100 bases for 100 talents, a talent for each base. 
EXO.38.28	The 1,775 shekels he made into hooks for the pillars, overlaid their capitals, and made bands for them. 
EXO.38.29	The bronze from the offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels. 
EXO.38.30	With it he made the bases for the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grating, all the utensils for the altar, 
EXO.38.31	along with the bases of the courtyard all around, the bases for the gate of the courtyard, as well as all the pegs of the Tabernacle and the pegs for the courtyard all around.
EXO.39.1	Next they made woven garments of blue, purple and scarlet, for ministering in the holy place. They made the holy garments for Aaron, as 
EXO.39.2	He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen. 
EXO.39.3	They hammered the gold into thin plates, and cut it into threads, to work it in with the blue, purple and scarlet, within the fine linen, the work of a skillful craftsman. 
EXO.39.4	Then they made shoulder pieces for it, joined together at the two ends. 
EXO.39.5	The artfully woven band on the ephod, with which to gird it, was of the same piece and the same kind of workmanship of gold, blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen, as 
EXO.39.6	They placed the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, etched with the engravings of a signet seal, according to the names of 
EXO.39.7	He put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, to be memorial stones for 
EXO.39.8	He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful craftsman, like the work of the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen. 
EXO.39.9	It was square and folded doubled, a span long and a span wide. 
EXO.39.10	They mounted within it four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz and emerald were the first row. 
EXO.39.11	In the second row were a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond. 
EXO.39.12	In the third row were a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst, 
EXO.39.13	and in the fourth row were a beryl, an onyx and a jasper. They were enclosed in fittings of gold within their settings. 
EXO.39.14	The stones corresponded to the names of 
EXO.39.15	They attached braided chains to the breastplate, of wreathed work from pure gold. 
EXO.39.16	They made two settings of gold, and two golden rings, and set the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
EXO.39.17	They attached the two golden chains to the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
EXO.39.18	The other two ends of the chains they placed on the two settings, and fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, in the front. 
EXO.39.19	They also made two golden rings, and set them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge that was toward the side of the ephod facing inward. 
EXO.39.20	They made two more rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod underneath, in the front, enclosed by their coupling, above the artfully woven band of the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	Then they bound the breastplate by the rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue thread, so that it would rest on the artfully woven band and not be loosened from the ephod, as 
EXO.39.22	He also made the robe of the ephod from woven work, all of blue, 
EXO.39.23	with a hole in the center of the robe, and a binding woven around the hole as a collar, so that it would not be torn. 
EXO.39.24	They also made, on the hem of the robe, pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet and twisted linen. 
EXO.39.25	Then they made bells of pure gold and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around, between the pomegranates, 
EXO.39.26	a bell and a pomegranate, then another bell and a pomegranate, all around on the hem of the robe, to minister in, as 
EXO.39.27	Then they made the sashes of fine linen, woven work for Aaron and for his sons, 
EXO.39.28	the turban of fine linen, the headwear, the linen undergarments of finely twisted linen, 
EXO.39.29	along with the tunic of checkered work, in blue, purple and scarlet, the work of a color weaver, as 
EXO.39.30	Finally they made the plate of the holy coronet from pure gold, and wrote an inscription on it, like the engraving of a signet seal: HOLY TO 
EXO.39.31	They tied to it a blue thread, to fasten onto the turban above, as 
EXO.39.32	So all the work of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was finished. 
EXO.39.33	Then they brought the Tabernacle to Moses, along with the tent and all of its furnishings, its clasps, its boards, its crossbars, its pillars, and its bases; 
EXO.39.34	along with the covering of ram skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, the veil of the curtain; 
EXO.39.35	as well as the Ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the atonement cover; 
EXO.39.36	the table and all of its utensils, the showbread; 
EXO.39.37	the pure 
EXO.39.38	the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the curtain for the entrance of the tent; 
EXO.39.39	the bronze altar, its grating and its poles along with all of its utensils, and the basin and its base; 
EXO.39.40	the hangings for the courtyard, with its pillars, its bases and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, with its cords and its pegs, along with all the instruments for the service of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting; 
EXO.39.41	as well as the woven garments for ministering in the Sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the 
EXO.39.42	According to everything that 
EXO.39.43	When Moses saw the entire work, and that they had done it just as 
EXO.40.1	Then 
EXO.40.2	“On the first day of the first month, you will set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
EXO.40.3	You are to put the Ark of the Testimony there, and screen off the Ark with the curtain. 
EXO.40.4	Then bring in the table, and set in order the bread that is on it. Bring in the 
EXO.40.5	Set the golden incense altar in front of the Ark of the Testimony, and hang the curtain over the entrance of the Tabernacle. 
EXO.40.6	“Set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. 
EXO.40.7	Set up the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 
EXO.40.8	Set up the courtyard all around, and hang the curtain of the gate of the courtyard. 
EXO.40.9	“Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle, and everything within it, and consecrate it, along with all of its furnishings, and it will be holy. 
EXO.40.10	Also you are to anoint the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils and consecrate the altar. The altar will be most holy. 
EXO.40.11	Then you are to anoint the basin along with its base and sanctify it. 
EXO.40.12	“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water. 
EXO.40.13	Put the holy garments on Aaron, anoint him and consecrate him, so that he may minister to Me as a 
EXO.40.14	Also bring his sons and put tunics upon them. 
EXO.40.15	You are to anoint them, as you did their father, so that they too may minister to Me as 
EXO.40.16	Moses did so, just as 
EXO.40.17	Now it happened during the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the Tabernacle was raised up. 
EXO.40.18	Moses raised the Tabernacle, and laid its bases, set up the framework of boards, put in the crossbars and set up its pillars. 
EXO.40.19	Then he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on it, just as 
EXO.40.20	He placed the Testimony into the Ark, set the poles on the Ark, and put the atonement cover on top of the Ark. 
EXO.40.21	He brought the Ark into the Tabernacle, set up the curtain as a screen, and screened off the Ark of the Testimony, just as 
EXO.40.22	Then he set up the table inside the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the Tabernacle northward, outside the curtain. 
EXO.40.23	He set a row of bread in order upon it before 
EXO.40.24	Then he placed the 
EXO.40.25	Then he lit the lamps before 
EXO.40.26	Next he placed the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the curtain, 
EXO.40.27	and he burned sweet spices of incense there, just as 
EXO.40.28	He hung the curtain over the entrance of the Tabernacle. 
EXO.40.29	Then he set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as 
EXO.40.30	Next he set up the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, 
EXO.40.31	so that Moses, Aaron and his sons could wash their hands and their feet there. 
EXO.40.32	When they went into the Tent of Meeting and when they came near to the altar, they washed, just as 
EXO.40.33	He set up the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar and set up the screen at the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.34	Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of 
EXO.40.35	Moses was unable to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud resided there and the glory of 
EXO.40.36	Now whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, 
EXO.40.37	But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not move out until the day that it was.

LEV.2.5	If your sacrifice is a grain offering from the pan, it is to consist of fine flour, mixed with oil, 
LEV.2.6	You shall cut it in pieces and pour oil on it. It is a grain offering. 
LEV.2.7	“Now if your sacrifice is a grain offering of the pan, it is to be made of fine flour with oil. 
LEV.2.8	When you bring the grain offering that is made of these things to 
LEV.2.9	The 
LEV.2.10	What is left of the grain offering is for Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion of the offerings to 
LEV.2.11	“Every grain offering which you present to 
LEV.2.12	As a gift of firstfruits you may offer them to 
LEV.2.13	Also you are to season with salt every sacrifice of your grain offering. You are never to allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your sacrifices you must offer salt. 
LEV.2.14	“If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to 
LEV.2.15	You are then to put oil and frankincense on it. It is a grain offering.

LEV.3.5	Aaron’s sons are to burn it up as smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering, which is over the wood that is on the fire. It is an offering made by fire—a soothing aroma to

LEV.3.14	From it he is to offer as his sacrifice an offering made by fire to 
LEV.3.15	the two kidneys and the fat that is over them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, which he must remove with the kidneys. 
LEV.3.16	The 
LEV.3.17	“It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you must eat neither fat nor blood.”
LEV.4.1	 spoke to Moses, saying: 
LEV.4.2	“Speak to 
LEV.4.3	—or if the anointed 
LEV.4.4	He is to bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before 
LEV.4.5	The anointed

LEV.4.9	the two kidneys and the fat that is over them which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys, 
LEV.4.10	just as it is removed from the bull of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings. The 
LEV.4.11	The bull’s hide, all its flesh, with its head, along with its legs, its innards and its dung— 
LEV.4.12	the entire bull—he is to carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the fat ashes are poured out, and burn it over wood in the fire. It is to be burned on top of the place of pouring fat ashes. 
LEV.4.13	“Now if the whole congregation of Israel sins, but the deed is hidden from the eyes of the community, yet they have done one of 
LEV.4.14	When the sin that they committed becomes known, then the community is to offer a young bull for a sin offering, and bring it before the Tent of Meeting. 
LEV.4.15	The elders of the congregation are to lay their hands on the head of the bull before 
LEV.4.16	The anointed 
LEV.4.17	Then the 
LEV.4.18	He is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before

LEV.4.20	He is also to do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering—he must do the same with it. So the 
LEV.4.21	Then he is to carry the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is the sin offering for the community. 
LEV.4.22	“When a ruler sins and unwittingly does one of the 
LEV.4.23	When his sin that he committed is made known to him, he is to bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish. 
LEV.4.24	He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before 
LEV.4.25	The 
LEV.4.26	He is to burn all its fat on the altar, just like the fat of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings. So the 
LEV.4.27	“When anyone of the common people sins unwittingly by doing one of

LEV.4.29	He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and then slaughter it at the place of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.30	The 
LEV.4.31	He is to take away all its fat, just like the fat is taken away from off of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings. And the 
LEV.4.32	“Now if he brings a lamb as his sacrifice for a sin offering, he is to bring a female without blemish. 
LEV.4.33	He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the burnt offering. 
LEV.4.34	The 
LEV.4.35	He must remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of fellowship offerings. Then the 
LEV.5.1	“If a soul sins—after hearing a charge of an oath, and he is a witness whether he has seen or otherwise known—if he fails to report it, then he will bear his guilt. 
LEV.5.2	“Or if a person touches any unclean thing—whether it is the carcass of an unclean animal or the carcass of unclean livestock or the carcass of unclean creeping things, though it is hidden from him, still he is unclean and he will be guilty. 
LEV.5.3	“Or if he touches some human uncleanness, whatever his filth is by which he is unclean, though it is hidden from him, when he knows of it, then he will be guilty. 
LEV.5.4	“Or if a person swears rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good—about anything that one might utter rashly by an oath, though it is hidden from him, when he realizes it, then he will be guilty of one of these. 
LEV.5.5	“So it will be, when one becomes guilty of one of these things, he shall confess about what he has sinned. 
LEV.5.6	Then he is to bring his trespass offering to 
LEV.5.7	“But if one cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring, as his trespass offering for the sin he committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, to 
LEV.5.8	He is to bring them to the

LEV.5.10	He is to make the second a burnt offering, according to the regulation. So the 
LEV.5.11	“But if one cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he is to bring as his offering for the sin he has committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He is to put no oil on it nor put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering. 
LEV.5.12	He is to bring it to the 
LEV.5.13	The 
LEV.5.14	 spoke to Moses, saying: 
LEV.5.15	“If anyone commits a faithless act and sins unwittingly against the holy things of 
LEV.5.16	He is to make restitution for that which he has done wrong in regard to the holy thing, and is required to add a fifth part to it, and give it to the

LEV.5.20	Then 
LEV.5.21	“Suppose anyone sins and commits a faithless act against 
LEV.5.22	or has found what was lost and lied about it, swearing falsely—so sinning in one of any of these things that a man may do. 
LEV.5.23	Then it will be, when he has sinned and has become guilty, that he must restore what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit that was committed to him, or what was lost that he found, 
LEV.5.24	or any thing about which he has sworn falsely, he is to restore it in full, and add a fifth part more to it. He must give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day of presenting his trespass offering. 
LEV.5.25	He is to bring his trespass offering to 
LEV.5.26	The 
LEV.6.1	 spoke to Moses, saying: 
LEV.6.2	“Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the 
LEV.6.3	The 
LEV.6.4	Then he is to take off his garments, put on other ones, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. 
LEV.6.5	The fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it—it must not go out. Each morning the 
LEV.6.6	Fire is to be kept burning on the altar continually—it must not go out. 
LEV.6.7	“Now this is the 
LEV.6.8	So he is to lift up from it his handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with some of its oil and all the frankincense which is on the grain offering, and burn it up as smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma, as its memorial portion to 
LEV.6.9	Then what is left from it Aaron and his sons are to eat. It is to be eaten as 
LEV.6.10	It must not be baked with 
LEV.6.11	Every male among the children of Aaron may eat it, as their portion forever throughout your generations from the offerings of

LEV.6.15	The anointed 
LEV.6.16	Thus every grain offering of a

LEV.6.18	“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: ‘This is the

LEV.6.20	Whatever touches its flesh will be holy. When any of its blood is splattered on a garment, you are to wash it in a holy place. 
LEV.6.21	But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled is to be broken, and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it is to be scoured, then rinsed in water. 
LEV.6.22	Every male among the 
LEV.6.23	But no sin offering from which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place is to be eaten—it must be burned up with fire. 
LEV.7.1	“This is the 
LEV.7.2	In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering, he is to slaughter the trespass offering. And he is to splash its blood around on the altar. 
LEV.7.3	He should offer all of its fat, the fat tail and the fat that covers the innards, 
LEV.7.4	along with the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, plus the cover on the liver that he is to remove with the kidneys. 
LEV.7.5	Then the 
LEV.7.6	Every male among the 
LEV.7.7	“As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering, there is one 
LEV.7.8	The 
LEV.7.9	Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is prepared on the flat plate and on the pan, is to belong to the 
LEV.7.10	Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all the sons of Aaron equally. 
LEV.7.11	“Now this is the 
LEV.7.12	If he brings it for a thanksgiving, then he is to present with the sacrifice of thanksgiving 
LEV.7.13	He is to present his offering with the sacrifice of his fellowship offerings for thanksgiving along with cakes of bread with 
LEV.7.14	From each he is to offer one out of every offering as a gift to 
LEV.7.15	The meat of the sacrifice of his fellowship offerings for thanksgiving is to be eaten on the day of his offering. He is not to leave any of it until the morning. 
LEV.7.16	“But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it is to be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice. On the next day what remains of it may be eaten. 
LEV.7.17	But what remains of the meat of the sacrifice on the third day is to be burned up with fire. 
LEV.7.18	If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his fellowship offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, nor will it be credited to him who offers it. It will be a foul thing—and the soul who eats any from it will bear his own iniquity. 
LEV.7.19	“The meat that touches any unclean thing is not to be eaten. It is to be burned up with fire. As for the meat, everyone who is clean may eat it, 
LEV.7.20	but the soul who eats of the meat of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings belonging to 
LEV.7.21	If anyone touches any unclean thing, whether the uncleanness of man, or an unclean animal or any unclean detestable thing, and eats some of the meat of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings belonging to 
LEV.7.22	 spoke to Moses, saying: 
LEV.7.23	“Speak to 
LEV.7.24	The fat of a dead animal and the fat of a torn animal may be used for any other service, but you must not eat it. 
LEV.7.25	For if anyone eats the fat of the animal from which an offering is made by fire to 
LEV.7.26	“You are not to eat any blood, whether it is from a bird or an animal, in any of your dwellings. 
LEV.7.27	Whoever it is who consumes any blood, that soul is to be cut off from his people.’” 
LEV.7.28	Then 
LEV.7.29	“Speak to 
LEV.7.30	With his own hands he is to bring 
LEV.7.31	The 
LEV.7.32	The right thigh you are to give to the 
LEV.7.33	The one among Aaron’s sons who offers the blood of the fellowship offerings and the fat is to have the right thigh for a portion. 
LEV.7.34	For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh contribution I have taken from 
LEV.7.35	This is the anointed portion of Aaron and the anointed portion of his sons out of the offerings of 
LEV.7.36	 commanded these to be given to them from 
LEV.7.37	This is the 
LEV.7.38	which 
LEV.8.1	Then 
LEV.8.2	“Take Aaron and his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams and the basket of 
LEV.8.3	Then assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.” 
LEV.8.4	So Moses did as 
LEV.8.5	Moses said to the congregation, “This is what 
LEV.8.6	Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. 
LEV.8.7	He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and tied the skillfully decorated sash of the ephod around him and fastened it on him. 
LEV.8.8	He then placed the breastplate on Aaron, and inside the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. 
LEV.8.9	He set the turban on his head, and on front of the turban he set the golden plate, the holy crown, just as 
LEV.8.10	Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and all that was in it, and so consecrated them. 
LEV.8.11	He sprinkled the oil on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. 
LEV.8.12	He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. 
LEV.8.13	Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, tied sashes on them, and fastened headbands on them, as 
LEV.8.14	Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	Moses then slaughtered it, took the blood and dabbed it onto the horns of the altar with his finger, and so purified the altar. Then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it. 
LEV.8.16	He then took all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and burned it up as smoke on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bull and its hide, its flesh and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as 
LEV.8.18	He then presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	Then Moses slaughtered it and splashed the blood around on the altar. 
LEV.8.20	After he cut the ram into its pieces, Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat. 
LEV.8.21	He washed the innards and the legs with water. Then Moses burned the whole ram up in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to 
LEV.8.22	Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.23	Moses slaughtered it, took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot. 
LEV.8.24	Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet. Then Moses splashed the blood around on the altar. 
LEV.8.25	He took the fat, the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the innards, as well as the cover of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh. 
LEV.8.26	Then out of the basket of 
LEV.8.27	He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave offering before 
LEV.8.28	Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were a consecration for a soothing aroma. It was an offering by fire to 
LEV.8.29	Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before 
LEV.8.30	Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him. So he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons and his sons’ garments with him. 
LEV.8.31	Moses then said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and eat it there, along with the bread that is in the basket of ordination, as I commanded, saying: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ 
LEV.8.32	What remains of the meat and of the bread you should burn with fire. 
LEV.8.33	You are not to go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are fulfilled, for he will be filling your hands for seven days. 
LEV.8.34	What has been done this day, 
LEV.8.35	You are to stay at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days, and keep 
LEV.8.36	Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things that 
LEV.9.1	Now it happened on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel. 
LEV.9.2	Then he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before 
LEV.9.3	You are to speak to 
LEV.9.4	plus a bull and a ram for fellowship offerings, to sacrifice before 
LEV.9.5	So they brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and the entire congregation drew near and stood before 
LEV.9.6	Moses said, “This is what 
LEV.9.7	Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and bring your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Then present the offering for the people, and make atonement for them, as 
LEV.9.8	So Aaron drew near to the altar, and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
LEV.9.9	The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him. Then he dipped his finger in the blood, dabbed it onto the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. 
LEV.9.10	But the fat, the kidneys and the cover from the liver of the sin offering he burned up as smoke on the altar, as 
LEV.9.11	The flesh and the hide he burned in a fire outside the camp. 
LEV.9.12	Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering, then his sons presented the blood to him and he splashed it around on the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They handed the burnt offering to him piece by piece, along with the head, and he burned them up as smoke on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	He washed the innards and the legs and he offered them in smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar. 
LEV.9.15	Then he presented the people’s gift, took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, just like the first one. 
LEV.9.16	He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the decree. 
LEV.9.17	Then Aaron presented the grain offering, filling his hand with some of it and burning it up as smoke on the altar, alongside the burnt offering of the morning. 
LEV.9.18	He also slaughtered the bull and the ram as the sacrifice of fellowship offerings for the people. Then his sons brought him the blood, which he splashed around on the altar, 
LEV.9.19	as well as the fat from the bull and the ram, the fat tail, and the layer over the innards along with the kidneys and the covering of the liver. 
LEV.9.20	They put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned it on the altar. 
LEV.9.21	But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before 
LEV.9.22	Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. Then he stepped down from presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. 
LEV.9.23	Moses and Aaron then went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came back out and blessed the people, the glory of 
LEV.9.24	Fire came out from the presence of 
LEV.10.1	Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his own censer, put fire in it, laid incense over it, and offered unauthorized fire before 
LEV.10.2	So fire came out from the presence of 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what 
LEV.10.4	Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come near, carry your relatives away from the front of the Sanctuary to outside of the camp.” 
LEV.10.5	So they drew near and carried them, still in their tunics, outside of the camp, as Moses had said. 
LEV.10.6	Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons: “Do not uncover your heads or tear your clothes, so you may not die and He will not be angry with the entire congregation. But let your kinsmen—the whole house of Israel—mourn over the burning that 
LEV.10.7	You must not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of 
LEV.10.8	 spoke to Aaron saying: 
LEV.10.9	“Do not drink wine or fermented drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, so that you do not die. This is to be a statute forever throughout your generations. 
LEV.10.10	You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean. 
LEV.10.11	And you are to teach 
LEV.10.12	Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Itamar his surviving sons: “Take the grain ­offering left over from 
LEV.10.13	You are to eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion and your sons’ portion of the offerings of 
LEV.10.14	You are to eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented in a clean place—you, your sons and your daughters with you—for they are given as your portion, and your children’s portion, out of the sacrifices of the fellowship offerings of 
LEV.10.15	They are to bring the thigh that is presented and the breast that is waved with fat portions scorched by fire, to wave it as a wave offering before 
LEV.10.16	Then Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering and noticed it had been burned up. So he snapped at Eleazar and Itamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying: 
LEV.10.17	“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the Sanctuary, since it is most holy, and He gave it to you in order to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before 
LEV.10.18	Look, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly shall have eaten it in the Sanctuary, as I commanded.” 
LEV.10.19	But Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before 
LEV.10.20	When Moses heard this, it was good in his eyes.
LEV.11.1	 spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, 
LEV.11.2	“Speak to 
LEV.11.3	Whatever has a split, divided hoof and chews cud among the animals—that you may eat. 
LEV.11.4	“Nevertheless, you should not eat of those that only chew cud, or have a split hoof. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof, is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.5	The coney, though it chews the cud yet does not have a divided hoof, so it is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.6	The hare, though it chews the cud, does not split the hoof, so it is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.7	The pig, though it has a split, divided hoof, does not chew cud, so it is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.8	You are not to eat meat from them, nor are you to touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you. 
LEV.11.9	“From all that are in the waters, you may eat whatever has fins and scales, within the waters, in the seas and in the rivers. Those you may eat. 
LEV.11.10	But any that do not have fins and scales in the seas or the rivers, among those that swarm on the waters, or among any of the living creatures that are in the waters, they are loathsome to you. 
LEV.11.11	They are to be detestable to you. You should not eat meat from them and you should detest their carcasses. 
LEV.11.12	Whatever has neither fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing to you. 
LEV.11.13	“Among the birds you should detest the following—they are not to be eaten—they are loathsome: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, 
LEV.11.14	the red kite, any kind of black kite, 
LEV.11.15	any kind of raven, 
LEV.11.16	the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 
LEV.11.17	the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, 
LEV.11.18	the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, 
LEV.11.19	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
LEV.11.20	“All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you. 
LEV.11.21	Yet you may eat from all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to hop on the earth. 
LEV.11.22	You may eat from any kind of locust, any kind of katydid, any kind of cricket and any kind of grasshopper. 
LEV.11.23	But all winged creeping things that have four feet are loathsome to you. 
LEV.11.24	“Moreover, by these also you will become unclean: whoever touches their carcasses should be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.25	Whoever carries any part of their carcass is to wash his clothes, and will be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.26	“Every animal with a separating hoof but not split, or does not chew cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them will become unclean. 
LEV.11.27	So whatever moves on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, is unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.28	Whoever carries their carcasses, is to wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you. 
LEV.11.29	“Among the creeping things that creep on the earth, the following are unclean to you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard, 
LEV.11.30	the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon. 
LEV.11.31	Among all that creep these are the ones that are unclean to you. Whoever touches them when they are dead, will be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.32	Whatever falls on them when they are dead will become unclean, whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sackcloth. Whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it will be unclean until the evening, then it will be clean. 
LEV.11.33	“Now if any of them falls into a clay pot, everything that is in it will become unclean, and you are to break it. 
LEV.11.34	Any food that may be eaten but has water on it from such a pot will become unclean. Also any drink that may be drunk in any such pot will become unclean. 
LEV.11.35	Everything on which part of their carcass falls will become unclean. An oven or stove for pots is to be broken in pieces. They are unclean and will be unclean to you. 
LEV.11.36	Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern for collecting water will be clean, though anyone who touches their carcass will become unclean. 
LEV.11.37	If part of a carcass falls on any seed for sowing that has yet to be sown, it is clean. 
LEV.11.38	But if water is put on the seed, and part of a carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.39	“If any animal that you may eat dies, the one who touches its carcass will become unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.40	He who eats of its carcass is to wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. Also, the one who carries its carcass is to wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.41	“Every creeping thing that crawls on the earth is detestable—it shall not be eaten. 
LEV.11.42	Whatever moves on its belly or crawls on all fours or has many feet among all the creeping things that crawl on the earth, these you are not to eat, for they are detestable. 
LEV.11.43	You are not to contaminate yourselves with any creeping thing that crawls nor make yourselves unclean with them or defiled by them.

LEV.16.16	So he is to make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the ­uncleanness of 
LEV.16.17	No one is to be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out, and has made atonement for himself and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.

LEV.20.17	If a man takes his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and sees her nakedness, and she his, it is a shameful thing. They are to be cut off in the sight of the children of their people, for he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness, and will bear his iniquity. 
LEV.20.18	If a man lies with a woman during her

LEV.25.11	That fiftieth year will be your Jubilee. You are not to sow, or reap that which grows by itself, or gather from the untended vines. 
LEV.25.12	Since it is a Jubilee, it is to be holy to you. You will eat from its increase out of the field. 
LEV.25.13	“In this Year of Jubilee each of you will return to his property. 
LEV.25.14	“If you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you are not to wrong one another. 
LEV.25.15	Corresponding to the number of years after the Jubilee you are to purchase land from your neighbor’s hand. He is to sell it to you based on the number of years of crops. 
LEV.25.16	In proportion to the extent of years you may increase its price, or decrease its price in proportion to the fewness of years, because he is selling a number of harvests to you. 
LEV.25.17	You are not to cheat one another, but fear your God, for I am 
LEV.25.18	“Therefore you are to keep My statutes and observe My ordinances, and carry them out, so that you may live securely in the land. 
LEV.25.19	Then the land will yield its fruit, and you may eat your fill and live there in safety. 
LEV.25.20	Now if you ask: What are we to eat during the seventh year if, see, we are not to sow, nor gather in our increase? 
LEV.25.21	Now I will command My blessing to you in the sixth year, so that it will yield a harvest sufficient for three years. 
LEV.25.22	When you sow during the eighth year, you will still be eating the old, stored harvest until the harvest of the ninth year comes in. 
LEV.25.23	“Moreover, the land is not to be sold ­permanently, because the land is Mine. For you are sojourners with Me. 
LEV.25.24	For any land you possess, you are to provide for redemption of the land. 
LEV.25.25	“If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his property, then his nearest kinsman may come and redeem what his brother has sold. 
LEV.25.26	If a man has no kinsman-redeemer, but he himself recovers and finds sufficient means to redeem it, 
LEV.25.27	then let him reckon the years since its sale and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it. Then he will return to his property. 
LEV.25.28	But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold is to remain in the hand of the one who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee. Then in the Jubilee it shall be released, so he may return to his property. 
LEV.25.29	“If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he has the right of redemption. 
LEV.25.30	But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city will belong permanently to the one who bought it throughout his generations. It will not be released in the Jubilee. 
LEV.25.31	But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them are to be considered as open country. They have redemption rights and are to be released in the Jubilee. 
LEV.25.32	“But as for the towns of the Levites, the Levites may have a permanent right of redemption for the houses in the towns of their possession. 
LEV.25.33	The Levites may redeem a house sold in the town of its possession. Also it shall be released in the Jubilee, for the houses of the Levitical towns are their possession among 
LEV.25.34	But the fields in the pasturelands of their cities may not be sold, for it is their permanent possession. 
LEV.25.35	“If your brother has become poor and his hand cannot support himself among you, then you are to uphold him. He may live with you like an outsider or a temporary resident. 
LEV.25.36	Take no excessive interest from him, but fear your God, so that your brother can live with you. 
LEV.25.37	You are not to lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. 
LEV.25.38	I am 
LEV.25.39	“If your brother has grown poor among you and sells himself to you, you must not subject him to slave labor. 
LEV.25.40	Let him stay with you as a hired worker or as a temporary resident. He will work for you until the Year of Jubilee, 
LEV.25.41	then he is to be released from you—he and his children with him—and may return to his own family and to the property of his fathers. 
LEV.25.42	For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They are not to be sold in a slave sale. 
LEV.25.43	You are not to rule over him with harshness, but fear your God. 
LEV.25.44	“As for your male and female slaves whom you may acquire out of the nations that are around you—from them you may buy male and female slaves. 
LEV.25.45	You may also acquire from among the children of the foreigners dwelling among you, as well as from their families who are with you—those born in your land—they may also become your property. 
LEV.25.46	You may also leave them an inheritance for your children after you, to receive as a possession. These may become your slaves permanently. But over your brothers, 
LEV.25.47	“If an outsider or sojourner with you becomes rich, while your brother beside him has become poor and sells himself to the outsider dwelling among you or to a member of the outsider’s family, 
LEV.25.48	after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him, 
LEV.25.49	or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or anyone who is a close relative to him from his family may also redeem him. Or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself. 
LEV.25.50	He is to calculate with the one who bought him, from the year that he sold himself to the Year of Jubilee, and the price of his sale will be in proportion to the number of years. Like the days of a hired worker it will be with him. 
LEV.25.51	If there are still many years, in proportion to those he is to reimburse the price of his redemption from his purchase price. 
LEV.25.52	If there remain only a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall calculate with him in proportion to his years of service he is to reimburse the price of his redemption. 
LEV.25.53	He will stay with him as a hired worker, year by year. But he is not to rule with harshness over him in your sight. 
LEV.25.54	Even if he is not redeemed by these means, then he will still be released in the Year of Jubilee—he and his children with him. 
LEV.25.55	For 
LEV.26.1	“You are not to make idols for yourselves, nor raise up an engraved image or a standing-stone, or place any carved stone in your land to bow down to it. For I am 
LEV.26.2	“You are to keep My 
LEV.26.3	“If you walk in My statutes, keep My 
LEV.26.4	then I will give you rains in their season, the land will yield its crops, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit. 
LEV.26.5	Your threshing will last until grape gathering, the grape gathering will last until the sowing time, you will eat your bread to the full, and live securely in your land. 
LEV.26.6	“I will bring 
LEV.26.7	You will chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.8	Five of you will chase 100 and 100 of you will chase 10,000, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you. 
LEV.26.9	“I will turn toward you, make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you. 
LEV.26.10	You will eat the old harvest and clear out the old because of the new. 
LEV.26.11	I will set My Tabernacle among you, and My soul will not abhor you. 
LEV.26.12	I will walk among you and will be your God, and you will be My people. 
LEV.26.13	I am 
LEV.26.14	“But if you will not listen to Me, nor carry out all these 
LEV.26.15	and if you reject My statutes and if your soul abhors My ordinances, so that you do not keep all My 
LEV.26.16	then I will do the following to you in return. I will appoint terror over you, wasting disease and fever that will dim the eyes and cause the soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. 
LEV.26.17	I will set My face against you and you will be routed before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you. 
LEV.26.18	“If you, in spite of these things, will not listen to Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 
LEV.26.19	I will break your pride of power. I will make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze. 
LEV.26.20	Also your strength will be spent in vain, for your land will not yield its increase, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit. 
LEV.26.21	“If you keep walking contrary to Me and will not listen to Me, then I will multiply the plagues on you seven times like your sins. 
LEV.26.22	I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you so few in number that your roads will become deserted. 
LEV.26.23	“Now if in spite of these things you will not be chastened by Me, but walk contrary to Me instead, 
LEV.26.24	then I will also walk contrary to you. Then I will strike you, I Myself, seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.25	I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant, and you will be gathered together inside your cities. I will send the pestilence among you and you will be given into the hand of the enemy. 
LEV.26.26	When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied. 
LEV.26.27	“Yet if in spite of this you will not listen to Me but walk contrary to Me, 
LEV.26.28	then I will walk contrary to you in wrath. So I will chastise you seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.29	You will eat the flesh of your sons and you will eat the flesh of your daughters. 
LEV.26.30	I will destroy your high places and cut down your altars of incense, cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols, and My soul will abhor you. 
LEV.26.31	I will lay waste your cities and devastate your sanctuaries. I will not smell your soothing aromas. 
LEV.26.32	I will make the land desolate and your enemies settling there will be astonished at it. 
LEV.26.33	I will scatter you among the nations and I will draw out the sword after you. So your land will become a desolation and your cities will become a waste. 
LEV.26.34	Then the land will enjoy its

LEV.26.37	They will stumble over one another, as if before the sword, when no one pursues, and you will have no strength to stand before your enemies. 
LEV.26.38	You will perish among the nations and the land of your enemies will devour you. 
LEV.26.39	Those of you who are left in the land of your enemies will rot away because of their iniquity, and because of the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them. 
LEV.26.40	“But if they confess their iniquity and that of their fathers, in the treachery they committed against Me, and how they walked contrary to Me 
LEV.26.41	—in return I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies—and if at that time their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled, so that they accept the punishment for their iniquity, 
LEV.26.42	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob and also My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. 
LEV.26.43	But the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its

LEV.27.4	If it is a female, then your valuation shall be 30 shekels. 
LEV.27.5	If the person is from five years to 20 years old, then your valuation is to be 20 shekels for a male and ten shekels for a female. 
LEV.27.6	If the person is from one month to five years old, then your valuation is to be five shekels of silver for a male and three shekels of silver for a female. 
LEV.27.7	If the person is from 60 years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation is to be 15 shekels and for a female ten shekels.

NUM.1.2	“Do a head count of all the community of 
NUM.1.3	You and Aaron are to muster by their divisions every son from 20 years and upward available to serve in the army of Israel. 
NUM.1.4	One man from each tribe, each head of his father’s household, is to assist you. 
NUM.1.5	“These then are the names of the men who will assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur.

NUM.1.16	These were those selected from the community, princes of their ancestral tribes. They were heads of the thousands of Israel. 
NUM.1.17	So Moses and Aaron took these men designated by name. 
NUM.1.18	They assembled all the community on the first day of the second month. They declared their lineage according to their families, the households of their forefathers, with the number of the names of those 20 years old and upward being listed individually. 
NUM.1.19	Moses numbered Israel in the wilderness of Sinai just as 
NUM.1.20	The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn (their generations, their families, by their ancestral households, according to the count of their names, every male from 20 years and upward, all available for the army),

NUM.1.22	From the sons of Simeon (their generations, according to their families, their ancestral households, whose names were counted by polls, every male 20 years and upward, every one who would go with the army),

NUM.1.42	From the sons of Naphtali (their generations by their families, their ancestral households, by number everyone 20 years old and upward who would go out with the army), 
NUM.1.43	those counted from the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400. 
NUM.1.44	These were the ones numbered—Moses, Aaron and the princes of Israel counted them. Each of the twelve men represented his ancestral house.

NUM.2.18	On the west will be the standard of the camp of Ephraim, by their divisions. The prince of the sons of Ephraim is Elishama son of Ammihud. 
NUM.2.19	His division, by their numbers, is 40,500.

NUM.3.17	These were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
NUM.3.18	These then were the names of the sons of Gershon by their families—Libni and Shimei. 
NUM.3.19	The sons of Kohath by their families were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
NUM.3.20	The sons of Merari, by their families, are Mahli and Mushi. These then were the families of the Levites by their ancestral households. 
NUM.3.21	To Gershon belonged the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites. These were the families of the Gershonites. 
NUM.3.22	The number of every male one month old and upward who were counted was 7,500. 
NUM.3.23	The Gershonites were to camp behind the Tabernacle on the west.

NUM.3.26	the curtains of the courtyard, the screen of the entrance of the courtyard around the Tabernacle and altar, its ropes and all related to its use. 
NUM.3.27	To Kohath belonged the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites. These were the Kohathite families. 
NUM.3.28	The number of every male one month old and upward was 8,600. Their duties were caring for the Sanctuary. 
NUM.3.29	The Kohathite families were to camp along the side of the Tabernacle on the south. 
NUM.3.30	The prince of the ancestral household of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. 
NUM.3.31	They were responsible for the Ark, the table, the

NUM.3.33	To Merari belonged the families of the Mahlites and the Mushites. These were the families of Merari. 
NUM.3.34	Their number by count of every male one month old and upward was 6,200. 
NUM.3.35	The prince of the household of the father of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail. They were to camp on the north side of the Tabernacle. 
NUM.3.36	The sons of Merari were appointed over the care of the frames of the Tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, and all equipment for its use, 
NUM.3.37	the posts of the surrounding courtyard, their bases, pegs and ropes. 
NUM.3.38	Those camping in front of the Tent of Meeting, on the east, toward the sunrise, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons. They were to care for the Sanctuary on behalf of 
NUM.3.39	All the Levites counted by Moses and Aaron at the word of 
NUM.3.40	 said to Moses, “Count every firstborn male of 
NUM.3.41	Set the Levites apart for me in place of all the firstborn of 
NUM.3.42	So Moses counted all the firstborn of 
NUM.3.43	The sum total of the firstborn males of

NUM.3.45	“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of 
NUM.3.46	To redeem the 273 firstborn of 
NUM.3.47	you are to collect five shekels for each, based on the shekel of the Sanctuary, which is 20 gerahs. 
NUM.3.48	Give the money for the redemption of the extra ones of the firstborn of them to Aaron and his sons.” 
NUM.3.49	Hence Moses collected the redemption money for those exceeding the number redeemed by the Levites. 
NUM.3.50	From the firstborn of 
NUM.3.51	Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, just as 
NUM.4.1	 spoke to Moses and to Aaron saying, 
NUM.4.2	“Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families and by their ancestral households, 
NUM.4.3	everyone from 30 years of age to 50, all who come to serve doing the work in the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.4.4	“This is the task of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting—the most holy things. 
NUM.4.5	Whenever the camp is about to move out, Aaron and his sons are to take down the shielding curtain and cover the Ark of the Testimony with it. 
NUM.4.6	Then they are to cover this with porpoise hide, then spread over it a cloth of solid blue. Then they are to put its poles in place. 
NUM.4.7	“Then over the table of the Presence they are to spread a solid blue cloth, then lay on it the plates, ladles, bowls, and jars for the drink offering. The bread that is continually there is to remain there. 
NUM.4.8	Over them they are to spread a solid scarlet cloth, cover it with a covering of porpoise hide, then install its poles. 
NUM.4.9	“Then they are to take a blue cloth and cover the

NUM.4.12	“They are to take all the utensils used for the service of the ministry of the Sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover them with porpoise hide, and place them on a carrying frame. 
NUM.4.13	“They are to remove the ashes from the altar, then spread over it a purple cloth. 
NUM.4.14	They are to put onto it all the utensils with which they tend to the altar, among them the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. They are to spread over it a covering of porpoise hide and install its poles. 
NUM.4.15	“When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the Sanctuary and all its holy implements, and when the camp is ready to move out, after this the sons of Kohath may come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy items or they will die. These are the task of the sons of Kohath with regard to the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.4.16	“Eleazar son of Aaron the 
NUM.4.17	 spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, 
NUM.4.18	“You are not to let the families of the tribe of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites. 
NUM.4.19	Do this for them so that they may live and not die whenever they approach the most holy items–-Aaron and his sons are to go into the Sanctuary and assign each man his job and his responsibility. 
NUM.4.20	But the Kohathites are not to go in to look at what is holy, not even momentarily, or they will die.” 
NUM.4.21	Again 
NUM.4.22	“Take a census also of the sons of Gershon, by their ancestral households and by their families. 
NUM.4.23	Count all the males from 30 to 50 years of age, everyone coming to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.4.24	This is the task of the Gershonite families in working and carrying burdens. 
NUM.4.25	They are to carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its covering, the outer covering of porpoise hide, the curtains for the entrance for the Tent of Meeting, 
NUM.4.26	the curtains surrounding the courtyard and the altar, the curtain for the entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its operations. They are to do all that needs to be done with these things. 
NUM.4.27	The sons of the Gershonites are to do all their tasks, whether carrying or doing other work, according to the word of Aaron and his sons. You are to assign to them all that is their responsibility to carry. 
NUM.4.28	This is the duty of the families of the sons of the Gershonites regarding the Tent of Meeting. Their duty will be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the 
NUM.4.29	Next, count the sons of Merari, according to their families and their ancestral houses, 
NUM.4.30	sons 30 years old and upward to 50, everyone coming to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.4.31	This is their task in the service of the Tent of Meeting: the frames of the Tabernacle, its crossbars, posts and bases, 
NUM.4.32	as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard, plus their bases, tent pegs, ropes, and all their paraphernalia with everything related to their operation. Assign to them by name their duties and tasks. 
NUM.4.33	This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari as they work under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the 
NUM.4.34	So Moses, Aaron and the princes of the community counted the sons of the Kohathites according to their families and their ancestral households. 
NUM.4.35	All the men who came to do the service of the Tent of Meeting, from 30 to 50 years of age, 
NUM.4.36	were counted by families—2,750. 
NUM.4.37	This was the total of those in the families of the Kohathites, every one serving in the Tent of Meeting—Moses and Aaron counted them according to the mouth of 
NUM.4.38	The sons of Gershon were counted according to their families and their ancestral households. 
NUM.4.39	Males from 30 years old and upward to 50, all those coming into the work of the service of the Tent of Meeting, 
NUM.4.40	numbered according to their families and ancestral households 2,630. 
NUM.4.41	These were those counted from the families of the sons of Gershon, each serving in the Tent of Meeting—Moses and Aaron counted according to the mouth of 
NUM.4.42	Those were counted from the families and ancestral households of the sons of Merari, 
NUM.4.43	from 30 years of age upward to 50, who came to the work of the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.4.44	Numbered by their families, they were 3,200. 
NUM.4.45	These were those numbered from the families of the sons of Merari by Moses and Aaron in accordance with the mouth of 
NUM.4.46	Thus Moses, Aaron and the princes of Israel counted all the Levites by their families and by their ancestral houses. 
NUM.4.47	All the men from 30 to 50 years old who came to do the work of the service and of carrying the Tent of Meeting 
NUM.4.48	numbered 8,580. 
NUM.4.49	From the mouth of 
NUM.5.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.5.2	“Command 
NUM.5.3	Whether male or female, you are to send them outside the camp so as not to defile the camp where I am dwelling among them.” 
NUM.5.4	This 
NUM.5.5	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.5.6	“Say to 
NUM.5.7	That person is to confess the sin he has committed, make full restitution for his wrong, add one fifth to it and give it to the one he wronged. 
NUM.5.8	But if that person has no close relative to whom to pay the restitution, the restitution belongs to

NUM.5.27	“When she is made to drink the water that carries the curse, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, it will enter her and cause bitterness—her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away. She will be accursed among her people. 
NUM.5.28	If, however, the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will be free from guilt and be able to have children. 
NUM.5.29	“This is the

NUM.6.6	All the days of his separation to 
NUM.6.7	Even if his father, mother, brother or sister should die, he is not to make himself unclean, because his consecration to God is on his head. 
NUM.6.8	All the days of his separation, he is to be consecrated to

NUM.6.19	The 
NUM.6.20	The 
NUM.6.21	This is the 
NUM.6.22	Again 
NUM.6.23	“Speak to Aaron and to his sons saying: Thus you are to bless

NUM.7.1	When Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its implements, the altar and all its utensils, and he anointed and consecrated them. 
NUM.7.2	Then the princes of Israel, heads of their ancestral houses—they were tribal princes in charge over those who were numbered—gave offerings. 
NUM.7.3	They brought as their gift before 
NUM.7.4	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.7.5	“Accept these from them to use in the service of the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites to use as each man’s work requires.” 
NUM.7.6	So Moses took the carts and the oxen and he gave them to the Levites. 
NUM.7.7	He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, as their work required, 
NUM.7.8	and four carts and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, as their work required, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the

NUM.8.5	Again 
NUM.8.6	“Take the Levites from among 
NUM.8.7	This is what you must do to them to make them clean: Sprinkle the purifying water on them, then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, thus purifying themselves. 
NUM.8.8	“Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, plus a second young bull for a sin offering. 
NUM.8.9	Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting, and gather the whole community of

NUM.9.20	At times the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle only a few days. At 
NUM.9.21	At times the cloud remained only from evening until morning. When the cloud would lift, they would set out. Whether by day or by night, when the cloud lifted, they would set out. 
NUM.9.22	Whether for two days or a month or a year, while the cloud remained over the Tabernacle, 
NUM.9.23	At 
NUM.10.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.10.2	“Make two trumpets of hammered silver for yourself. They are for summoning the community and having the camps set out. 
NUM.10.3	Whenever both are sounded, the whole community is to gather toward you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.10.4	But if only one is sounded, the princes—the heads of the tribes of Israel—are to gather toward you. 
NUM.10.5	When you sound the trumpet the first time, the camp of those camped on the east is to set out. 
NUM.10.6	When you sound the trumpet blast the second time, the camp of those camped on the south is to set out. Short blasts will be the signal for their moving out. 
NUM.10.7	To gather the whole national community, you are to sound the sustained blasts, but not the short blasts. 
NUM.10.8	The sons of Aaron, the 
NUM.10.9	Whenever you go to war in your own land against the enemy who is hostile to you, you are to sound short blasts of alarm. Then you will be remembered before 
NUM.10.10	Also at your days of rejoicing, feasts and new moons, you are to blow on the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. They will then be a reminder for you before 
NUM.10.11	On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted up from above the Tabernacle of the Testimony. 
NUM.10.12	Then 
NUM.10.13	So they set out the first time by the mouth of 
NUM.10.14	The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set out first by their divisions. Over them was Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
NUM.10.15	Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar. 
NUM.10.16	Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon. 
NUM.10.17	Then the Tabernacle was disassembled, and the sons of Gershon and Merari, who were carrying it, set out. 
NUM.10.18	The standard of the camp of Reuben then set out, by their divisions. Over his division was Elizur son of Shedeur. 
NUM.10.19	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Simeon. 
NUM.10.20	Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel. 
NUM.10.21	Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy items. The Tabernacle was to be erected before their arrival. 
NUM.10.22	The standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set out next, by their divisions. Over his division was Elishama son of Ammihud. 
NUM.10.23	Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 
NUM.10.24	Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni. 
NUM.10.25	The standard of the camp of the tribe of the sons of Dan, being the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their divisions. Over his division was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 
NUM.10.26	Pagiel son of Ochran, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Asher. 
NUM.10.27	Ahira son of Enan, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali. 
NUM.10.28	This is the order by which 
NUM.10.29	Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out to the place about which 
NUM.10.30	But he said to him, “I will not go, because I would rather go to my own country and to my own people.” 
NUM.10.31	But he said, “Do not leave us now, because you know where we should camp in the wilderness. You can be like eyes to us. 
NUM.10.32	If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good 
NUM.10.33	So they advanced from the mountain of 
NUM.10.34	The cloud of 
NUM.10.35	Whenever the Ark would set out, Moses would say: “Arise, 
NUM.10.36	Then whenever it came to rest, he would say: “Return, 
NUM.11.1	The people were murmuring in the ears of 
NUM.11.2	The people cried out to Moses, so Moses prayed to 
NUM.11.3	The name of that place was thus called Taberah because fire from 
NUM.11.4	The grumblers among them began to have cravings, so 
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt, for free—the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic! 
NUM.11.6	But now we have no appetite. We never see anything but this 
NUM.11.7	Now the 
NUM.11.8	The people went about, gathered it up, and ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. It had a taste like something made with olive oil. 
NUM.11.9	When the dew descended on the camp at night, the 
NUM.11.10	Moses heard the people wailing by their families, each man at the door to his tent. 
NUM.11.11	So Moses asked 
NUM.11.12	Did I conceive all these people, or did I give birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom just as the nurse carries an infant’—to the land You promised to their fathers? 
NUM.11.13	Where can I get meat for all these people? For they wail to me saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to carry all these people by myself! The load is too heavy for me! 
NUM.11.15	If this is how You are treating me, kill me now! If I have found favor in Your eyes, kill me please—don’t let me see my own misery!” 
NUM.11.16	 said to Moses, “Bring me 70 of the elders of Israel whom you know to be elders of the people and their leaders. Take them to the Tent of Meeting, so they may stand with you there. 
NUM.11.17	Then I will come down and speak with you there, and, I will take some of the 
NUM.11.18	“Now to the people say: Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because you will eat meat, for you wailed in 
NUM.11.19	You will eat—not for one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but for an entire month—until it is coming out of your nostrils and it becomes loathsome to you! For you rejected 
NUM.11.21	Moses then said, “600,000 foot soldiers—the people I am in the middle of---yet You say, ‘I am going to give them meat to eat for an entire month?’ 
NUM.11.22	If flocks and herds were slaughtered, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught, would they have enough?” 
NUM.11.23	 said to Moses, “Is 
NUM.11.24	So Moses went out and told the people 
NUM.11.25	 descended in the cloud and spoke with him. He took some of the 
NUM.11.26	Two men, however, had remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad and the name of the other was Medad. The 
NUM.11.27	A young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” 
NUM.11.28	Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses since his youth, cried out and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” 
NUM.11.29	But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous on my behalf? If only 
NUM.11.30	Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
NUM.11.31	Now a wind went out from 
NUM.11.32	The people went out all that day and all that night and all the following day and collected quail. No one gathered less than ten omers. They spread them out all around the camp. 
NUM.11.33	Yet while the meat was between their teeth, before it was swallowed, 
NUM.11.34	For that reason the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah , because they buried the people who were craving. 
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth and stayed in Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on account of the Cushite woman he married, because he had married a Cushite woman. 
NUM.12.2	They asked, “Has 
NUM.12.3	Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than anyone on the face of the earth. 
NUM.12.4	Immediately, 
NUM.12.5	 descended in a column of cloud, stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and called to Aaron and Miriam. The two of them stepped forward. 
NUM.12.6	“Hear now My words!” He said. “When there is a prophet of 
NUM.12.7	Not so with My servant Moses. In all My house, he is faithful. 
NUM.12.8	I speak with him face to face, plainly and not in riddles. He even looks at the form of 
NUM.12.9	’s anger burned against them, and He left them. 
NUM.12.10	When the cloud lifted up from above the Tent, behold, Miriam had 
NUM.12.11	He said to Moses, “Please, my lord, don’t hold against us the sin we have committed so foolishly! 
NUM.12.12	Don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, who comes from his mother’s womb with his flesh half-eaten away!” 
NUM.12.13	So Moses cried to 
NUM.12.14	 said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be in shame for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days. After that she may be brought back.” 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was restricted to outside the camp for seven days. The people did not move on until Miriam was brought back. 
NUM.12.16	Afterward, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.13.2	“Send some men on your behalf to investigate the land of Canaan, which I am giving to 
NUM.13.3	So according to the word of 
NUM.13.4	These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur. 
NUM.13.5	From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori. 
NUM.13.6	From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh. 
NUM.13.7	From the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph. 
NUM.13.8	From the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun. 
NUM.13.9	From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu. 
NUM.13.10	From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi. 
NUM.13.11	From the tribe of Manasseh, part of the tribe of Joseph, Gaddi son of Susi. 
NUM.13.12	From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli. 
NUM.13.13	From the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael. 
NUM.13.14	From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi. 
NUM.13.15	From the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. 
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men Moses sent to investigate the land. (Now he gave Hoshea son of Nun, the name Joshua.) 
NUM.13.17	As he sent them to explore the land of Canaan, he said to them, “Go up there through the Negev, then go up into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	See what the land is like and the people living there, whether they might be strong or weak, few or many. 
NUM.13.19	In what kind of land are they living? Is it good or bad? Also, what about the cities in which they are living? Are they unwalled or do they have fortifications? 
NUM.13.20	How is the soil—fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) 
NUM.13.21	So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob the entrance of Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	They continued on up through the Negev and came to Hebron. There lived Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	When they reached as far as the Valley of Eshcol, they cut a single branch with a cluster of grapes. It was carried on a pole between two of them. They also cut some pomegranates and some figs. 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster cut by 
NUM.13.25	They returned from investigating the land after 40 days. 
NUM.13.26	They traveled and returned to Moses, Aaron and the entire community of 
NUM.13.27	They gave their account to him and said, “We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed it is flowing with milk and honey—this is some of its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	Except, the people living in the land are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw the sons of Anak there! 
NUM.13.29	Amalek is living in the land of the Negev, the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are living in the mountains, and the Canaanites are living near the sea and along the bank of the Jordan.” 
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “We should definitely go up and capture the land, for we can certainly do it!” 
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone up with him said, “We cannot attack these people, because they are stronger than we.” 
NUM.13.32	They spread among 
NUM.13.33	We also saw there the 
NUM.14.1	All through that night, the entire community raised up their voices. The people wept. 
NUM.14.2	All 
NUM.14.3	Why is 
NUM.14.4	They said to each other, “Let’s choose a leader and let’s go back to Egypt!” 
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the entire assembly of the community of 
NUM.14.6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes. 
NUM.14.7	They said to the whole assembly of 
NUM.14.8	If 
NUM.14.9	Only don’t rebel against 
NUM.14.10	But the whole assembly talked about violently stoning them. Then the glory of 
NUM.14.11	 said to Moses, “How long will these people treat Me contemptibly? How long will they neglect to trust in Me—in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them? 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them with the plague. I will destroy them. But you I will make into a nation greater and stronger than they!” 
NUM.14.13	Moses said to 
NUM.14.14	They will tell the residents of this land about it. Already they have heard that You, 
NUM.14.15	If you kill these people all at once, the nations who have heard this report about You will say, 
NUM.14.16	‘Because 
NUM.14.17	“So please, let 
NUM.14.18	‘
NUM.14.19	Forgive now the guiltiness of this people in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You have pardoned this people from Egypt until now!” 
NUM.14.20	 answered, “I have forgiven them just as you have spoken. 
NUM.14.21	But as certainly as I live and as certainly as the glory of 
NUM.14.22	none of the people who saw My glory and My miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet tested Me these ten times and did not obey My Voice—
NUM.14.23	not one of them will see the land I promised to their forefathers. None of those who treated Me with contempt will see it! 
NUM.14.24	However, My servant Caleb, because a different spirit is with him and he is wholeheartedly behind Me, I will bring him into the land where he went—his offspring will inherit it. 
NUM.14.25	Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are inhabiting the valley, turn back tomorrow and set out by the wilderness route toward the Sea of Reeds.” 
NUM.14.26	 then said to Moses and Aaron saying, 
NUM.14.27	“How long will this wicked community be grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of 
NUM.14.28	So tell them, ‘As surely as I live,’ says 
NUM.14.29	In this very wilderness your bodies will drop—every one of you 20 years of age and older who was numbered in the census and grumbled against Me. 
NUM.14.30	Not one of you will enter the land about which I lifted My hand to make home for you—except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
NUM.14.31	“As for your children—whom you said would be like plunder—I will bring them in and they will experience the land that you spurned. 
NUM.14.32	But your bodies will drop in this wilderness. 
NUM.14.33	Your children will be herdsmen in the wilderness for 40 years. They will suffer because of your unfaithfulness until your corpses are consumed in the wilderness. 
NUM.14.34	For 40 years, corresponding to the number of the 40 days you explored the land—one year for each day—you will suffer for your iniquities and know My hostility. 
NUM.14.35	I, 
NUM.14.36	Then the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land, who had returned and caused the whole community to grumble against him by spreading a bad report about the land, 
NUM.14.37	these men, spreading the bad report about the land, died of the plague in 
NUM.14.38	Of those men who had gone to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived. 
NUM.14.39	When Moses related these things to all of 
NUM.14.40	They rose the next morning and went up to the high mountains, saying, “Look! Let’s go up to the place which 
NUM.14.41	But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the mouth of 
NUM.14.42	You should not go up, because 
NUM.14.43	For the Amalekites and Canaanites are there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword. 
NUM.14.44	But presumptuously they went up to the high mountain country, though neither the Ark of 
NUM.14.45	The Amalekites and Canaanites living in the mountain country came down, attacked them, and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
NUM.15.1	Again 
NUM.15.2	“Speak to 
NUM.15.3	and you are presenting a fire offering to 
NUM.15.4	the one bringing the offering is to present a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil. 
NUM.15.5	“Now with each lamb for the burnt offering or sacrifice, you are to prepare a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering. 
NUM.15.6	With a ram, you are to prepare two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, 
NUM.15.7	and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. You are to offer it as a pleasing aroma to 
NUM.15.8	“Whenever you are to prepare a young bull for a burnt offering, a special vow offering, or a fellowship offering to 
NUM.15.9	bring with the young bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 
NUM.15.10	You are to also offer as the drink offering half a hin of wine as a fire offering, a pleasing aroma to 
NUM.15.11	This is to be done for each bull or ram, for each young goat or lamb. 
NUM.15.12	Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare. 
NUM.15.13	“Everyone native-born is to do these things like so when bringing a fire offering as a pleasant aroma to 
NUM.15.14	Whenever an outsider resides with you, or whoever is among you for your generations to come, and he is to present a fire offering as a fragrant aroma to 
NUM.15.15	“The community will have the same rule for you as well as for the resident outsider. It will be a lasting statute throughout your generations. As for you, so for the outsider will it be before 
NUM.15.16	The same 
NUM.15.17	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.15.18	“Speak to 
NUM.15.19	and you eat some of the food of the land, you are to offer a portion to 
NUM.15.20	You are to offer a cake from the first of your ground-up meal as an offering from your threshing floor—so you are to lift it up. 
NUM.15.21	Throughout your generations to come, you are to give this offering from the first of your ground-up meal.
NUM.15.22	“If you unintentionally fail, not keeping any of these 
NUM.15.23	 —that is, anything that 
NUM.15.24	and it is done unintentionally out of sight of the community, then the entire community is to offer one young bull from the herd for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to 
NUM.15.25	So the

NUM.15.34	They kept him under arrest, not being clear what was to be done to him. 
NUM.15.35	 said to Moses, “The man has to die. The whole assembly is to stone him with stones outside the camp.” 
NUM.15.36	So the whole assembly took him outside the camp. They stoned him with stones. He died just as 
NUM.15.37	 spoke to Moses saying,

NUM.15.39	It will be your own 
NUM.15.40	This way you will remember and obey all My

NUM.16.1	Now Korah, son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, and sons of Reuben—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—
NUM.16.2	rose up against Moses and took 250 men from 
NUM.16.3	They assembled against Moses and Aaron. They said to them, “You’ve gone too far! All the community is holy—all of them—and 
NUM.16.4	When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. 
NUM.16.5	Then he said to Korah and all his following saying, “In the morning 
NUM.16.6	Do this, Korah and your whole following! Take for yourselves censers. 
NUM.16.7	Put fire and incense into them in the presence of 
NUM.16.8	Moses also said to Korah, “Listen now, sons of Levi! 
NUM.16.9	Isn’t it enough that the God of Israel has set you apart from the community of Israel to bring you near to Him to do the work of the Tabernacle of 
NUM.16.10	So He brought you close, along with all your fellow sons of Levi. But you are seeking the priesthood, too! 
NUM.16.11	Therefore you and all your following are banding together against 
NUM.16.12	Then Moses sent word to call Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come! 
NUM.16.13	Isn’t it enough that you brought us from a land flowing with milk and honey, only to kill us in the wilderness? And now you would lord it over us? 
NUM.16.14	What’s more, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you now gouge out the eyes of those men? We won’t come!” 
NUM.16.15	Then Moses became very angry and said to 
NUM.16.16	So Moses said to Korah, “You and your whole following are to appear before 
NUM.16.17	Each man will take his censer and you are to put incense into them—250 censers total. You are to present it before 
NUM.16.18	So each man took his censer, put fire and incense into it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.16.19	When Korah and all his following had assembled in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, then the glory of 
NUM.16.20	Then 
NUM.16.21	“Separate yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may consume them at once!” 
NUM.16.22	But they fell on their faces and cried out, “O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, if one man sins, will you be angry with the entire community?” 
NUM.16.23	Then 
NUM.16.24	“Speak to the assembly saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan and Abiram!’” 
NUM.16.25	Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram. The elders of Israel followed after him. 
NUM.16.26	He warned the assembly saying, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men! Don’t touch anything that is theirs, or you will be swept away because of all their sins!” 
NUM.16.27	So they moved away from near the dwelling of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came outside and were standing at the entrance of their tents with their wives, their children, and their little ones. 
NUM.16.28	Moses said, “By this you will know that 
NUM.16.29	If every one of these men die a common death and experience what happens to all people, then 
NUM.16.30	But if 
NUM.16.31	As soon as he finished saying all these things, the ground split under them. 
NUM.16.32	The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with all their households, all of Korah’s people and all their possessions. 
NUM.16.33	They went down alive into 
NUM.16.34	All Israel around them fled at their outcry, for they shouted, “Perhaps the earth will swallow us!” 
NUM.16.35	Fire also came out from 
NUM.16.36	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the 
NUM.16.38	As for the censers of these men who sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be taken and hammered into sheets as a covering for the altar. For they were presented before

NUM.16.41	The next day, the entire community of 
NUM.16.42	But when they gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, behold, the cloud covered it and the glory appeared! 
NUM.16.43	Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.16.44	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from among this assembly so that I may immediately consume them!” So they fell on their faces. 
NUM.16.46	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take the censer, put into it fire from the altar and put in incense. Get going and hurry to the assembly and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from 
NUM.16.47	Aaron did just as Moses had said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague had already started among the people. But he offered the incense and made atonement for the people. 
NUM.16.48	He stood between the dead and the living and the plague stopped. 
NUM.16.49	However, there were 14,700 dead from the plague, besides those who died because of Korah. 
NUM.16.50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, when the plague had been halted.
NUM.17.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.17.2	“Speak to 
NUM.17.3	Write Aaron’s name on Levi’s staff, for there is to be one staff for the prince of each tribe. 
NUM.17.4	Then you are to place them in the Tent of Meeting, before the Testimony, where I meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	It will come about that the staff of the man I choose will sprout. I will then rid Myself of the grumblings of 
NUM.17.6	So Moses spoke to 
NUM.17.7	Moses placed the staffs before 
NUM.17.8	The next day, Moses entered the Tent of Testimony and behold, Aaron’s staff, from the house of Levi, had sprouted, blossomed, and produced almonds! 
NUM.17.9	Moses then brought all the staffs from 
NUM.17.10	 said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony to keep as a sign to the sons of rebellion, so that it may put an end to their grumblings against Me, and so they will not die.” 
NUM.17.11	Moses did just as

NUM.17.13	Anyone approaching the Tabernacle of

NUM.18.2	Bring with you your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, so that they may join you and assist you, both you and your sons with you, before the Tent of the Testimony. 
NUM.18.3	They are to perform their duties for you and for all matters related to the Tent. They must not approach the implements of the Sanctuary or the altar—otherwise, both you and they will die. 
NUM.18.4	They are to team with you and attend to the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. But no unauthorized person may intrude upon you. 
NUM.18.5	So you are to attend to the Sanctuary and the care of the altar, so no further wrath will fall on 
NUM.18.6	“See, I have personally taken your kinsmen, the Levites, from among 
NUM.18.7	But you and your sons with you are to maintain your priesthood for everything pertaining to the altar and inside the

NUM.18.10	You are to eat it as most holy. Every male may eat it— it is set apart for you. 
NUM.18.11	This also is yours: the gift of the wave offerings of 
NUM.18.12	All the finest olive oil, the finest new wine and grain they give to 
NUM.18.13	All the firstfruits of the land that they bring to 
NUM.18.14	Every devoted thing in Israel is yours.

NUM.18.17	But the firstborn of the ox, sheep or goat you are not to redeem. They are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar, and their fat you are to burn as a fire offering, a pleasing aroma to 
NUM.18.18	Their meat—the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh—is yours. 
NUM.18.19	Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings which 
NUM.18.20	 said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land nor share among them. I am your portion and your share among 
NUM.18.21	See, I have given all the tithes in Israel to the sons of Levi as an inheritance in return for all the work of the service they are doing in the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.18.22	From now on, 
NUM.18.23	The Levites will perform the service of the Tent of Meeting. They will bear the responsibility for their iniquity. It is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations. So among

NUM.18.26	“Speak now to the Levites and say to them: When you receive from

NUM.19.17	“For the unclean one, they are to take some of the ash of the burnt purification offering, and pour some fresh water into a jar.

NUM.19.19	The clean person will sprinkle the unclean one on the third and seventh days. He is to purify himself on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he is to wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he will be clean.
NUM.19.20	However, that man who is unclean but does not purify himself will be cut off from the community. He has defiled the Sanctuary of

NUM.19.22	Anything touched by an unclean person becomes unclean, and anyone touching it will be unclean until evening.”
NUM.20.1	In the first month, the entire community of 
NUM.20.2	Now there was no water for the community, so they assembled against Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	The people quarreled with Moses saying, “If only we had died when our brothers died before 
NUM.20.4	Now why have you brought the community of 
NUM.20.5	Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this evil place—a place without grain, fig, grapevine or pomegranate—and there’s no water to drink!” 
NUM.20.6	So Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of 
NUM.20.7	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.20.8	“Take the staff and gather the assembly, you and your brother Aaron. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give out its water. You will bring out water from the rock, and you will give the community something to drink, along with their livestock.” 
NUM.20.9	So Moses took the staff from before the presence of 
NUM.20.10	Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock. He said, “Listen now, you rebels! Must we bring you water from this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with the staff. Water gushed out and the community and its livestock drank. 
NUM.20.12	But 
NUM.20.13	These are the waters of Meribah where 
NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. “Thus says your brother, Israel: ‘You know all the hardship that came on us. 
NUM.20.15	Our forefathers went down to Egypt, so we lived there for a very long time. The Egyptians mistreated us, and our fathers. 
NUM.20.16	But we cried out to 
NUM.20.17	Permit us to pass through your territory. We will not cross through any field or vineyard or drink water of any well. But we will travel on the king’s highway. We will not deviate to the right or left until we will have passed through your territory.’” 
NUM.20.18	But Edom said to him, “You may not pass through me—or I will march out against you with the sword.” 
NUM.20.19	 then said to him, “We will travel on the main road, and if we or our livestock even drink any of your water, we will pay its price. It’s nothing, just to pass through on foot!” 
NUM.20.20	He answered, “You may not pass through!” Yet Edom came out to oppose them with a large and well-armed people. 
NUM.20.21	Since Edom refused to permit Israel to cross through her territory, Israel turned away from them.
NUM.20.22	The entirety of the community of 
NUM.20.23	Now at Mount Hor, near the Edomite border, 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land, which I have given to 
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and take them up Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.26	Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, and Aaron will be gathered up and will die there.” 
NUM.20.27	Moses did as 
NUM.20.28	Moses removed Aaron’s garments and placed them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there at the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar descended the mountain. 
NUM.20.29	When they saw that Aaron had died, the entire community mourned Aaron 30 days.
NUM.21.1	When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked Israel and captured some of them. 
NUM.21.2	Then Israel vowed to 
NUM.21.3	 listened to Israel’s plea and delivered up the Canaanites. They put them and their cities under the ban of destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah. 
NUM.21.4	They travelled from Mount Hor along the route to the Sea of Reeds in order to go around the land of Edom. The spirit of the people became impatient along the way. 
NUM.21.5	The people spoke against God and Moses: “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the wilderness, because there is no bread, no water, and our very spirits detest the despicable food? 
NUM.21.6	So 
NUM.21.7	The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against 
NUM.21.8	 said to Moses, “Make yourself a fiery snake and put it on a pole. Whenever anyone who has been bitten will look at it, he will live.” 
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole, and it happened that whenever a snake bit anyone and he looked at the bronze snake, he lived. 
NUM.21.10	 moved on and encamped at Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Ije-abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab toward the sunrise. 
NUM.21.12	From there they set out and camped in the Wadi Zered. 
NUM.21.13	They set out from there and camped along the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is also the border between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	Therefore, it is said in the Book of the Wars of 
NUM.21.15	and the slope of the wadis that leads to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab—” 
NUM.21.16	And from there—on to Beer. This is the well where 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song, “Spring up, O well! Sing about it!” 
NUM.21.18	The well the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank with their scepter and their staffs.” From the wilderness they went on to Mattanah. 
NUM.21.19	From Mattanah they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley in the field of Moab where the peak of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
NUM.21.21	Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites saying, 
NUM.21.22	“Permit us to pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard nor drink water from the wells. We will travel on the king’s highway until we will have passed through your territory.” 
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon called out his entire army and marched out into the desert to oppose Israel. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	But Israel struck him by the sword’s edge and conquered his land from Arnon to Jabbok as far as the Ammonites, because the border of the sons of Ammon was fortified. 
NUM.21.25	Israel conquered all these cities and occupied all the Amorite cities, Heshbon and all its towns. 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had fought with the former king of Moab and had taken from his control all the land as far as the Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	Therefore the poets say, “Come to Heshbon! Let her be rebuilt! Let the city of Sihon be restored! 
NUM.21.28	For fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon! It consumed Ar of Moab, the masters of Arnon’s heights! 
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, O Moab! You have been destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as refugees and his daughters as captives to Sihon, king of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.30	But we overthrew them! Heshbon as far as Dibon is destroyed! We have demolished them as far as Nophah up to Medeba.” 
NUM.21.31	So Israel was living in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	After Moses sent spies to Jazer, they captured her towns and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
NUM.21.33	Then they turned and went up the road to the Bashan. Og, king of the Bashan, went out to confront them, he and all his people, in battle at Edrei. 
NUM.21.34	 said to Moses, “Do not fear him. I have given him with all his people and his land into your hand. You are to do to him just as you did to Sihon, the Amorite king who was living in Heshbon.” 
NUM.21.35	So they struck him and his sons and his entire army until no survivor was left to him, and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.1	Then 
NUM.22.2	When Balak son of Zippor, realized all that 
NUM.22.3	Moab became terrified because there were so many people. Moab was filled with dread because of 
NUM.22.4	Moab said to the elders of Midian, “The multitude will lick up everything around us like the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
NUM.22.5	He sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor near the River in his native land, saying to him, “Look now, a people has come out of Egypt. See now, they cover the surface of the earth and are settling beside me. 
NUM.22.6	Come now, curse this people for me, because they are too strong for me! Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them away from the country. I know that whoever you bless will be blessed and whoever you curse will be accursed!” 
NUM.22.7	The elders of Moab and Midian left with divination fees in their hand. When they came to Balaam, they told him Balak’s words. 
NUM.22.8	He said to them, “Spend the night here. I will give you an answer just as 
NUM.22.9	God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” 
NUM.22.10	Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me: 
NUM.22.11	See, the people coming out of Egypt cover the surface of the land. Come now, curse them for me. Perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them away!” 
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them! Do not curse them, for they are blessed!” 
NUM.22.13	So Balaam got up in the morning and said to the officials of Balak, “Go back to your country, for 
NUM.22.14	So the Moabite officials got up, went back to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 
NUM.22.15	Balak again sent other dignitaries, more numerous and honored than these previous ones. 
NUM.22.16	They also came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor: Please let nothing keep you from coming to me! 
NUM.22.17	I will richly reward you, and everything you tell me I will do! Just come now and curse this people for me!” 
NUM.22.18	But Balaam answered Balak’s servants, “Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot cross beyond the mouth of 
NUM.22.19	But now, you may spend the night here, too. Then I may find out anything else 
NUM.22.20	God came to Balaam by night and said to him, “Since the men came to you to summon you, arise and go with them. However, only the word I tell you are you to do!” 
NUM.22.21	So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moabite princes. 
NUM.22.22	But the anger of God burned because he was going. The angel of 
NUM.22.23	when the donkey saw the angel of 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel of 
NUM.22.25	When the donkey saw the angel of 
NUM.22.26	The angel again moved. He stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, right or left. 
NUM.22.27	When the donkey saw the angel of 
NUM.22.28	Then 
NUM.22.29	Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you’ve made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you now!” 
NUM.22.30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey which you have ridden as always to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said. 
NUM.22.31	Then 
NUM.22.32	The angel of 
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, by now I would have killed you indeed, but let her live!” 
NUM.22.34	Balaam said to the angel of 
NUM.22.35	The angel of 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to greet him at the Moabite city on the border of the Arnon, the frontier of the territory. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really unable to reward you?” 
NUM.22.38	“Look, I have come to you now!” Balaam said to Balak. “Can I just say anything? I must speak only the message which God puts into my mouth.” 
NUM.22.39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the princes who were with him. 
NUM.22.41	In the morning, Balak took Balaam with him to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw part of the people.
NUM.23.1	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.2	So Balak did just as Balaam had said. Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.3	Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering. I will go and perhaps 
NUM.23.4	God met with Balaam and he said to Him, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I offered a bull and a ram.” 
NUM.23.5	 put a message into Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak and speak this.” 
NUM.23.6	Balaam went back to him. Behold, he was standing beside his offering with all the princes of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	Then he uttered his oracle and said, “From Aram, Balak brought me, Moab’s king from the mountains of the east: ‘Come! Curse Jacob for me! ‘Come! Denounce Israel!’ 
NUM.23.8	How can I curse one whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce one whom 
NUM.23.9	From the rocky peaks I see him. From the heights I behold him. Look, he lives as a nation apart, and does not consider himself as being like the other nations. 
NUM.23.10	Who can count Jacob’s dust? Who can number a fourth of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!” 
NUM.23.11	Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you’ve actually blessed them!” 
NUM.23.12	But in response he said, “Mustn’t I speak whatever 
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to him, “Come now with me to another place where you can see a part of them only, not all of them. Curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	He took him to Lookout Field on top of Pisgah. He built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.15	“Stay here beside your offering,” he said to Balak, “while I am meeting over there.” 
NUM.23.16	 met Balaam there and put a message into his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak and speak thus.” 
NUM.23.17	So he went to him, and behold, he and the princes of Moab were standing beside his offering. Balak asked him, “What did 
NUM.23.18	So he uttered his oracle and said: “Rise, Balak! Hear me, son of Zippor! 
NUM.23.19	God is not a man who lies, or a son of man who changes his mind! Does He speak and then not do it, or promise and not fulfill it? 
NUM.23.20	Look, I received a command to bless. He has blessed—I cannot change it! 
NUM.23.21	No misfortune is to be seen in Jacob, and no misery in Israel! 
NUM.23.22	God is bringing them from Egypt with the strong horns of the wild ox! 
NUM.23.23	There is no sorcery effective against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel! Now it will be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘See what God has done!’ 
NUM.23.24	The people rise like a lioness, like a lion who does not rest until he eats his prey and drinks his victim’s blood!” 
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them or bless them at all!” 
NUM.23.26	Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Haven’t I told you, ‘All that 
NUM.23.27	Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me to another place. Perhaps it will be pleasing to God and you may curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. 
NUM.23.29	Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” 
NUM.23.30	Balak did just as Balaam said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	When Balaam realized that it was pleasing in the eyes of 
NUM.24.2	Lifting up his eyes, Balaam saw Israel dwelling by tribes. The 
NUM.24.3	He uttered his oracle and said: “This is the oracle of Balaam son of Beor, and the oracle of a strong man whose eye has been opened, 
NUM.24.4	the oracle of one hearing God’s speech, one seeing Shaddai’s vision, one fallen down, yet with open eyes: 
NUM.24.5	How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, and your dwellings, O Israel! 
NUM.24.6	Like valleys they are spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by 
NUM.24.7	Water will flow from his buckets, his seed by abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag , his kingdom will be exalted. 
NUM.24.8	God is bringing him out of Egypt. like the strong horns of a wild ox. He devours nations hostile to him. He will crush their bones. His arrows will pierce them. 
NUM.24.9	He crouches like a lion or a lioness— who would rouse him? He who blesses you will be blessed, and he who curses you will be cursed.” 
NUM.24.10	Then Balak became furious at Balaam, and struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but look, you have blessed them these three times! 
NUM.24.11	Now, go home! I said I would reward you, but see, 
NUM.24.12	Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I indeed tell your messengers whom you sent to me saying: 
NUM.24.13	‘If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the mouth of 
NUM.24.14	Now, behold, I am going back to my people. Come, let me counsel you what these people will do to your people in the latter days. 
NUM.24.15	Then he uttered his oracle: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the strong man whose eye is opened, 
NUM.24.16	the oracle of one hearing God’s speech, one experiencing Elyon’s knowledge, one seeing Shaddai’s vision, one fallen down, yet with open eyes: 
NUM.24.17	‘I see him, yet not at this moment. I behold him, yet not in this location. For a star will come from Jacob, a scepter will arise from Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of all the sons of Seth. 
NUM.24.18	Edom will be conquered— his enemies will conquer Seir, but Israel will triumph. 
NUM.24.19	One from Jacob will rule and destroy the city’s survivors.” 
NUM.24.20	Then he saw Amalek, so he uttered his oracle and said: “Amalek was the first of nations, but will come to ruin at last.” 
NUM.24.21	Then he saw the Kenite, so he uttered his oracle and said, “Your dwelling is secure. Your nest is set in the rock. 
NUM.24.22	Yet Kain will be destroyed, when Asshur captures you.” 
NUM.24.23	Again he uttered his oracle and said, “O, who can live when God does this? 
NUM.24.24	Ships will come from Kittim’s shore. They will afflict Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to destruction.” 
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his own place, and Balak went on his way.
NUM.25.1	While Israel was staying in Shittim, the people began to have immoral sexual relations with women from Moab. 
NUM.25.2	Then they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, so the people were eating, and bowing down before their gods. 
NUM.25.3	When Israel became bound to Baal of Peor, the anger of 
NUM.25.4	 said to Moses, “Seize all the ringleaders and hang them before 
NUM.25.5	So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you, kill your men who have been joining themselves to Baal of Peor.” 
NUM.25.6	Then behold, a man from 
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the

NUM.25.9	However, 24,000 were dead because of the plague!
NUM.25.10	Then 
NUM.25.11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the 
NUM.25.12	So now say: See, I am making with him a covenant of 
NUM.25.13	It will be for him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood—because he was zealous for his God and atoned for 
NUM.25.14	The name of the Israelite man killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, a prince of a Simeonite ancestral household. 
NUM.25.15	The name of the executed Midianite woman was Cozbi, daughter of Zur—he was a tribal head of an ancestral house in Midian. 
NUM.25.16	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.25.17	“Deal with the Midianites as enemies and strike them. 
NUM.25.18	For they have been enemies to you in their deceptions of you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite prince, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague on account of the Peor incident.”
NUM.26.1	After the plague, 
NUM.26.2	“Take a headcount of the entire community of 
NUM.26.3	So Moses and Eleazar the 
NUM.26.4	“Just as 
NUM.26.5	The descendants of the sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn: by Hanoch the Hanochite family, by Pallu the Palluite family, 
NUM.26.6	by Hezron the Hezronite family, and by Carmi the Carmite family, 
NUM.26.7	these Reubenite families numbered 43,730.

NUM.30.4	If her father should hear her vow or her pledge with which she obligated herself and her father says nothing to her, all her vows and every pledge by which she has obligated herself will stand. 
NUM.30.5	But if her father should forbid it on the day of his hearing it, none of her vows or pledges by which she has obligated herself will stand. 
NUM.30.6	“Suppose she should marry, after her vow or a rash promise of her lips by which she obligated herself. 
NUM.30.7	Now if her husband hears about it but says nothing to her on the day he hears about it, her vows will stand and her pledges by which she has obligated herself will stand. 
NUM.30.8	But if her husband should hear about it and on the day he hears it he forbids it, he thereby nullifies her vow and her rash promise by which her lips have obligated her, and 
NUM.30.9	“Any vow or obligation of a widow or a divorced woman will be binding on her. 
NUM.30.10	If in her husband’s house she vowed or obligated herself by pledge under oath, 
NUM.30.11	and her husband should hear it and say nothing to her, not forbidding her, all her vows and every pledge by which she has obligated herself will stand. 
NUM.30.12	But if her husband should nullify them on the day when he hears of them, nothing from her lips, whether vow or pledge, will stand. Her husband has nullified them and 
NUM.30.13	Her husband may ratify or veto any vow or sworn oath to deny herself. 
NUM.30.14	“But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he is confirming all her vows and all her oaths that are on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her on the day of his hearing about it. 
NUM.30.15	But if he nullifies them after hearing about it, he will bear her guilt.” 
NUM.30.16	These are the statutes that 
NUM.31.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.31.2	“Take vengeance on the Midianites for

NUM.31.4	Send into the battle 1,000 men from each of the tribes of Israel.” 
NUM.31.5	So from the thousands of Israel 1,000 from each tribe were assigned, 12,000 in all. 
NUM.31.6	Moses sent them into battle, 1,000 from each tribe, and with them Phinehas son of Eleazar the 
NUM.31.7	They fought Midian just as 
NUM.31.8	Among the slain they also killed the Midianite kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. 
NUM.31.9	 also captured women and sons of Midian, along with all their herds and flocks, and plundered all their goods. 
NUM.31.10	They burned with fire all the Midianite cities, settlements, as well as all their camps. 
NUM.31.11	They seized all the plunder and all the spoil, both people and animals. 
NUM.31.12	They brought the captives, plunder and spoils to Moses, Eleazar the 
NUM.31.13	Moses, Eleazar the 
NUM.31.14	But Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, those returning from the campaign of the war. 
NUM.31.15	Moses said to them, “You let all the women live? 
NUM.31.16	Why, they are the ones—because of Balaam’s advice—who caused 
NUM.31.17	So now, kill all the boys and kill every woman who has been intimate with a man. 
NUM.31.18	But save for yourselves every girl who has not been intimate with a man.

NUM.31.20	Also purify every item of clothing as well as every item made of leather or wood.” 
NUM.31.21	Eleazar said to the men of the army who had gone to war, “This is the regulation of the 
NUM.31.22	The gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead, 
NUM.31.23	and anything able to pass through fire is to be put through the fire and will then be clean. It is also to be purified with the water of cleansing. Anything that cannot stand the fire is to be put through the water. 
NUM.31.24	You are to wash your clothes also on the seventh day. You will then be clean and may then come into the camp.” 
NUM.31.25	 said to Moses saying, 
NUM.31.26	“Count the total spoil from the captive people and animals—you, Eleazar the 
NUM.31.27	You are to divide the spoil between those fighting in the war, taking part in the battle, and the rest of the community. 
NUM.31.28	You are also to set apart from the men of war going into battle tribute to

NUM.31.32	The remaining plunder taken by the people of the army was 675,000 sheep, 
NUM.31.33	72,000 cattle, 
NUM.31.34	61,000 donkeys, 
NUM.31.35	and from the human spoil were 32,000 women who had never been intimate with a man. 
NUM.31.36	The half share of those going into battle was 337,500 sheep, 
NUM.31.37	of which 
NUM.31.38	36,000 cattle, of which 
NUM.31.39	30,500 donkeys, of which 
NUM.31.40	16,000 persons, of which the tribute to 
NUM.31.41	Moses gave the tribute, 
NUM.31.42	From the half belonging to 
NUM.31.43	half belonging to the community was: 337,500 of the sheep, 
NUM.31.44	36,000 cattle, 
NUM.31.45	30,500 donkeys, 
NUM.31.46	16,000 persons. 
NUM.31.47	From this half, Moses took one out of very 50 persons and animals, as 
NUM.31.48	Then the officers over the units of the army, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, came to Moses. 
NUM.31.49	They said to him, “Your servants have counted the heads of the men of war under our command, and not one is missing. 
NUM.31.50	So we have brought as an offering to 
NUM.31.51	Moses and Eleazar the 
NUM.31.52	All of the gold presented as a gift to 
NUM.31.53	Each of the men of the army had taken plunder for himself. 
NUM.31.54	Moses and Eleazar the 
NUM.32.1	The sons of Reuben and Gad had very large herds and flocks, and, they saw that the territory of Jazer and Gilead were ideal for livestock. 
NUM.32.2	So the sons of Reuben and Gad came and said to Moses, Eleazar the 
NUM.32.3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon— 
NUM.32.4	the territory 
NUM.32.5	Then they said, “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this territory be given to your servants as a possession. Don’t make us cross the Jordan.” 
NUM.32.6	Moses replied to the sons of Gad and Reuben, “Should your countrymen go to war while you dwell here? 
NUM.32.7	Why do you dishearten 
NUM.32.8	Your fathers did this when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land. 
NUM.32.9	They went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, but they discouraged the hearts of 
NUM.32.10	The anger of 
NUM.32.11	‘The men who came out of Egypt, from 20 years old and upward, will not see the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for they have not followed after Me with a whole heart—
NUM.32.12	except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they were wholehearted after 
NUM.32.13	The anger of 
NUM.32.14	“Now look, here you stand in the place of your fathers as a brood of sinful men to add more to 
NUM.32.15	If you turn away from Him, He will repeat again leaving this people in the wilderness, you being the cause of this people’s destruction.” 
NUM.32.16	Then they came up to him and said, “We will build sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our children. 
NUM.32.17	But we are prepared to arm ourselves and go ahead of 
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until each one of 
NUM.32.19	Yet we will not inherit with them on the side beyond the Jordan, since our inheritance has come on the east side of the Jordan.” 
NUM.32.20	Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves for battle for 
NUM.32.21	and if all of you cross the Jordan until 
NUM.32.22	and the land is subdued before 
NUM.32.23	“But if you don’t do this, behold, you sin against 
NUM.32.24	Build for yourselves cities for your children and pens for your flocks. Then do what has come out of your mouth.” 
NUM.32.25	The sons of Gad and Reuben said to Moses saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord is commanding. 
NUM.32.26	Our children, our wives, our flocks, and all of our herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. 
NUM.32.27	But your servants, every one armed for battle, will cross over for the war before 
NUM.32.28	Moses then gave orders about them to Eleazar the 
NUM.32.29	Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, everyone armed for battle before 
NUM.32.30	However, if they do not cross over fully armed, they are to possess the land of Canaan with you.” 
NUM.32.31	The sons of Gad and Reuben answered saying, “What 
NUM.32.32	We will cross fully armed before 
NUM.32.33	Moses then gave to them—the sons of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph—the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan—the land with its cities and the territory around the cities. 
NUM.32.34	The sons of Gad built up Dibon, Ataroth and Aroer, 
NUM.32.35	as well as Atroh-shophan, Jazer and Jogbehah, 
NUM.32.36	Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, as well as sheep pens. 
NUM.32.37	The sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
NUM.32.38	Nebo, Baal Meon, (cities whose names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave other names to the rebuilt cities. 
NUM.32.39	The sons of Machir son of Manasseh went up to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
NUM.32.40	So Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he lived there. 
NUM.32.41	Jair, a son of Manasseh, went and captured their settlements and named them Jair’s Villages. 
NUM.32.42	Nobah went and conquered Kenath and its settlements and named them Nobah after his own name.

NUM.33.7	They left from Etham and turned back toward Pi-Hahiroth, east of Baal-Zephon, and camped before Migdol. 
NUM.33.8	They left from before Pi-Hahiroth and passed through the sea into the wilderness. They traveled three days journey into the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah. 
NUM.33.9	They departed from Marah and went to Elim. There were twelve water springs and 70 palm trees in Elim, so they camped there.

NUM.33.49	They camped along the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim. 
NUM.33.50	 spoke to Moses along the Jordan in the plains of Moab across from Jericho saying, 
NUM.33.51	“Speak to 
NUM.33.52	You must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. You must destroy all their idols and cast images, and demolish their high places. 
NUM.33.53	You will take possession of the land, so you will settle in it, because I have given it to you to possess. 
NUM.33.54	“You are to divide the land by lot according to your families. To the large, make their inheritance larger, and to the small, make their inheritance smaller. Whatever comes out of the lot will be theirs. You are to distribute the inheritance according to your ancestral tribes. 
NUM.33.55	“But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, whoever you allow to remain will become to you barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land in which you will be living. 
NUM.33.56	Then what I had intended to do to them, I will do to you.”
NUM.34.1	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.34.2	“Command 
NUM.34.3	Your southern side will run from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom to the southern end of the Dead Sea on the east. 
NUM.34.4	Your border will cross south of the Scorpion Pass and continue to Zin and south of Kadesh-barnea, then go on to Hazar-addar and on to Azmon. 
NUM.34.5	Then the border will turn from Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt and end at the sea.

NUM.34.7	“Your northern boundary will be by running a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, 
NUM.34.8	then from Mount Hor to Levo-Hamath , then the boundary will go to Zedad. 
NUM.34.9	The border will continue on to Ziphron, ending at Hazar-Enan. This will be your northern border. 
NUM.34.10	“For your eastern border, run a line from Hazar-Enan to Shepham. 
NUM.34.11	From Shepham, the boundary will descend to Riblah on the east side of Ain, continuing along the eastern slopes of

NUM.34.15	These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan at Jericho, toward the sunrise.” 
NUM.34.16	 spoke to Moses saying, 
NUM.34.17	“These are the names of the men who will allot the land to you: Eleazar the 
NUM.34.18	Also you are to select one prince from each tribe to allot the land. 
NUM.34.19	These are their names: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh. 
NUM.34.20	From the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel son of Ammihud. 
NUM.34.21	From the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon. 
NUM.34.22	From the tribe of the sons of Dan, the prince is Bukki son of Jogli. 
NUM.34.23	From the sons of Joseph, from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, the prince is to be Hanniel son of Ephod.

NUM.34.28	The prince from the tribe of the sons of Naphtali is Pedahel son of Ammihud.” 
NUM.34.29	These were those

NUM.35.3	Thus they will have cities to live in and pastures for their cattle, flocks and all their livestock. 
NUM.35.4	The pastures you give the Levites will extend out from the walls around the cities for 1,000 cubits. 
NUM.35.5	You are to measure outside the cities 2,000 cubits on the east side, 2,000 cubits on the south side, on the west side 2,000 cubits, and on the north side 2,000 cubits. These are to be pasturelands for the cities. 
NUM.35.6	“Six of the cities you give the Levites are to be cities of refuge, to which anyone who kills anyone may flee. Besides these, you are to give the Levites 42 more cities.

NUM.35.12	They are to be cities for refuge from the avenger, so the manslayer may not die before standing trial before the assembly. 
NUM.35.13	The six cities you designate are to be your cities of refuge.

NUM.35.17	If anyone has a stone in his hand that could be deadly and strikes anyone with it so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must die. 
NUM.35.18	Or if someone has a wooden object that could kill and strikes anyone so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must be put to death. 
NUM.35.19	The blood avenger himself may put the murderer to death. When he finds him, he is to kill him.

NUM.36.2	They said, “My lord, 
NUM.36.3	“If they become wives of men from other tribes of Israel, their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. So it will be deducted from the allotment of our inheritance. 
NUM.36.4	When the Jubilee year comes, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry and deducted from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe.” 
NUM.36.5	Then Moses commanded 
NUM.36.6	This is the word that 
NUM.36.7	So no inheritance may be passed from tribe to tribe among 
NUM.36.8	Every daughter receiving an inheritance in one of the tribes of

NUM.36.11	Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah—married sons of their uncles. 
NUM.36.12	They married within the families of the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their ancestral family. 
NUM.36.13	These are the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan—in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Di-Zahab. 
DEU.1.2	It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. 
DEU.1.3	Now Moses spoke to 
DEU.1.4	after he had struck down Sihon king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of the Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
DEU.1.5	Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this 
DEU.1.6	“
DEU.1.7	Turn, journey on, and enter the hill country of the Amorites and all their neighbors, in the Arabah, the hill country, the lowland, the Negev, and by the seashore—the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates. 
DEU.1.8	See, I have set the land before you. Enter and possess the land that 
DEU.1.9	“I spoke to you at that time saying: ‘I am not able to bear the burden of you by myself. 
DEU.1.10	 your God has multiplied you—and here you are today, like the stars of the heavens in number. 
DEU.1.11	“‘May 
DEU.1.12	How can I bear your load and burden and bickering by myself? 
DEU.1.13	Choose for yourselves wise and discerning men, well known to your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.’ 
DEU.1.14	“You answered me and said: ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’ 
DEU.1.15	So I took the heads of your tribes, men who were wise and well known, and appointed them as heads over you—leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, leaders of tens, and officials for your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	“I commanded your judges at that time saying: ‘Hear cases between your brothers, and judge fairly between a man and his brother or the outsider with him. 
DEU.1.17	You must not show partiality in judgment —you must hear the small and the great alike. Fear no man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me and I will hear it.’ 
DEU.1.18	“I commanded you at that time everything you should do. 
DEU.1.19	“Then we journeyed from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as 
DEU.1.20	I said to you: ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which 
DEU.1.21	See, 
DEU.1.22	“Then all of you came near to me and said: ‘Let’s send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring us back word about the way we should go up and the cities we will enter.’ 
DEU.1.23	“The idea seemed good to me, so I took twelve men from among you—one man for each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They turned and went up into the hill country, and they came to the Wadi Eshcol and spied it out. 
DEU.1.25	They took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us. They also brought back word to us and said, ‘Good is the land that 
DEU.1.26	“Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of 
DEU.1.27	In your tents you grumbled and said: ‘Because 
DEU.1.28	Where are we going? Our brothers have discouraged our hearts saying, “The people are greater and taller than we are! The cities are great and fortified up to the heavens! Besides, we have even seen the children of Anakim there!”’ 
DEU.1.29	“Then I said to you, ‘Don’t tremble or be afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	 your God, who goes before you, He Himself will fight for you—just as He did for you in Egypt before your own eyes, 
DEU.1.31	and in the wilderness, where you saw how 
DEU.1.32	Yet for all this you did not trust in 
DEU.1.33	the One who goes before you on the way to scout out a place for you to camp and to show you the way you should go, in fire by night and in the cloud by day. 
DEU.1.34	“When 
DEU.1.35	‘Not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give your fathers— 
DEU.1.36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it—yet to him and his children I will give the land that he has walked on, because he has followed 
DEU.1.37	“
DEU.1.38	Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter there—encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit it. 
DEU.1.39	“‘Moreover, your little ones—whom you said would become plunder, and your children who today have no knowledge of good or evil—they will enter there. To them I will give it and they will possess it. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn around and journey into the wilderness by way of the Sea of Reeds .’ 
DEU.1.41	“Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against 
DEU.1.42	“But 
DEU.1.43	“So I told you, but you would not listen—you rebelled against the command of 
DEU.1.44	The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you, and they chased you as bees do and scattered you from Seir to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	Then you returned and wept before 
DEU.1.46	“So you stayed in Kadesh many days—like the days you had spent before.
DEU.2.1	“Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Reeds, just as 
DEU.2.2	“
DEU.2.3	‘You have gone around this hill country long enough—turn to the north. 
DEU.2.4	Command the people saying, “You are about to cross into the territory of your relatives, the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so be very careful. 
DEU.2.5	Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land—not even a footprint—because I have given the hill country of Seir to Esau as a possession. 
DEU.2.6	You are to buy food from them for money so that you may eat, and you are also to buy water from them for money so that you may drink. 
DEU.2.7	For 
DEU.2.8	“So we went on past our relatives the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the way of the Arabah from Elath and Ezion-geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
DEU.2.9	“
DEU.2.10	(The Emim used to live there—a great and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim. 
DEU.2.11	These people also are considered Rephaim, like the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
DEU.2.12	Now the Horites used to live in Seir, but the sons of Esau drove them out and destroyed them from before themselves and settled in their place—just as Israel did to the land of its possession that 
DEU.2.13	Now rise up, and cross over the Wadi Zered.’ So we went over the Wadi Zered. 
DEU.2.14	“The time that we traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the Wadi Zered was 38 years—until all the generation of the men of war from within the camp came to an end, as 
DEU.2.15	Indeed, the hand of 
DEU.2.16	“Now when all the men of war had finished dying from among the people, 
DEU.2.17	 spoke to me saying, 
DEU.2.18	‘Today you are about to cross the border of Moab at Ar. 
DEU.2.19	When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harass or provoke them—for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession. 
DEU.2.20	(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim used to live there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim— 
DEU.2.21	a great and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim. But 
DEU.2.22	It was just as 
DEU.2.23	As for the Avvim who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Crete destroyed them and settled in their place.)
DEU.2.24	“‘Rise up, journey on, and cross over the Wadi Arnon. See, I have handed over Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land—begin to possess it! Engage him in battle! 
DEU.2.25	This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven. When they hear the report about you, they will tremble and twist in anguish because of you.’ 
DEU.2.26	“So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of 
DEU.2.27	‘Let me pass through your land—I will go only by way of the road. I will not turn to the right or to the left. 
DEU.2.28	You will sell me food for money so that I may eat and give me water for money so that I may drink. Just let me pass through on foot—
DEU.2.29	as the sons of Esau dwelling in Seir and the Moabites in Ar did for me—until I cross over the Jordan into the land that 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, because 
DEU.2.31	“
DEU.2.32	“Then Sihon came out against us—he and all his people—to battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	 our God gave him over to us, and we struck him down along with his sons and all his people. 
DEU.2.34	We captured all his cities at that time, and utterly put under a ban of judgment every city—men, women and children. We left no survivor. 
DEU.2.35	We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, as the spoils of the cities we captured. 
DEU.2.36	From Aroer which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon and the city by the wadi, all the way up to the Gilead, there was not a town too high for us. 
DEU.2.37	Only you did not come near the land of the sons of Ammon—all along the Wadi Jabbok and the cities of the hill country and wherever 
DEU.3.1	“Next we turned and went up the way to the Bashan. King Og of the Bashan came out against us—he and all his people—for battle at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	But 
DEU.3.3	“So 
DEU.3.4	We captured all his cities at that time—there was not a town that we did not take from them—sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in the Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, in addition to a great many unwalled towns. 
DEU.3.6	We utterly destroyed them, just as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city—men, women and children. 
DEU.3.7	But all the livestock and the spoils of the cities we took as plunder for ourselves. 
DEU.3.8	“So at that time we took from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
DEU.3.9	(Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
DEU.3.10	We took all the cities of the plain and all the Gilead and all the Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in the Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(For only King Og of the Bashan survived from the remnant of the Rephaim. In fact, his bed was made of iron—is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.)
DEU.3.12	“This land we took in possession at that time—from Aroer by the Wadi Arnon and half the hill country of the Gilead and its cities—I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites. 
DEU.3.13	The rest of the Gilead and all of the Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of the Argob. (All the Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites. He called them—the Bashan—after his own name, Havvoth-jair’s Villages, as it is the case to this day.) 
DEU.3.15	“To Machir I gave the Gilead. 
DEU.3.16	To the Reubenite and Gadites I gave from the Gilead as far as the Wadi Arnon—the middle of the wadi as the border—and as far as Jabbok, the wadi that is the border of the sons of Ammon, 
DEU.3.17	and the Arabah, with the Jordan as the border from 
DEU.3.18	“I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘
DEU.3.19	Only your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) may stay in your cities that I have given you, 
DEU.3.20	until 
DEU.3.21	“I commanded Joshua at that time saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that 
DEU.3.22	You must not fear them, for it is 
DEU.3.23	“I pleaded with 
DEU.3.24	‘O Lord 
DEU.3.25	Please! Let me cross over and see the good land across the Jordan—that good hill country and the Lebanon.’ 
DEU.3.26	“But 
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of Pisgah, look around to the west and the north and the south and the east, and see with your eyes—for you will not cross over this Jordan. 
DEU.3.28	But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over before this people, and he will enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’ 
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	“Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching you to do, so that you may live and go in and possess the land that 
DEU.4.2	You must not add to the word that I am commanding you or take away from it—in order to keep the 
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what 
DEU.4.4	But you who held tight to 
DEU.4.5	“See, just as 
DEU.4.6	You must keep and do them, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples, who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ 
DEU.4.7	For what great nation is there that has gods so near to them, as 
DEU.4.8	What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances that are righteous—like all of this 
DEU.4.9	“Only be watchful and watch over your soul closely, so you do not forget the things your eyes have seen and they slip from your heart all the days of your life. You are to make them known to your children and your children’s children. 
DEU.4.10	The day that you stood before 
DEU.4.11	“You came near and stood at the bottom of the mountain while the mountain was blazing with fire up to the heart of the heavens—darkness, cloud, and fog. 
DEU.4.12	 spoke to you from the midst of the fire. The sound of words you heard, but a form you did not see—only a voice. 
DEU.4.13	He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to do—the Ten Words—and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. 
DEU.4.14	 commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, so that you might do them in the land you are crossing over to possess. 
DEU.4.15	“So be very watchful over your souls since you saw no form on the day that 
DEU.4.16	so that you do not act corruptly and make for yourselves a graven image in the likeness of any figure—the form of a male or female, 
DEU.4.17	the form of any animal that is on the earth, the form of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
DEU.4.18	the form of anything that creeps on the ground, the form of any fish that is in the water under the earth— 
DEU.4.19	and so that you do not lift up your eyes toward the heavens and see the sun and the moon and the stars—all the heavenly host—and are drawn away and bow down and worship them. 
DEU.4.20	But you, 
DEU.4.21	“Furthermore 
DEU.4.22	For I must die in this land; I am not crossing over the Jordan. But you will cross over and take possession of that good land. 
DEU.4.23	Watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the covenant of 
DEU.4.24	For 
DEU.4.25	“When you father children and children’s children and have been in the land a long time, and you act corruptly and make a graven image in the form of anything and do evil in the sight of 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will certainly be carried off quickly from the land you are crossing over the Jordan to possess. You will not prolong your days on it, for you will certainly be destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	 will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where 
DEU.4.28	There you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone, which do not see or hear or eat or smell. 
DEU.4.29	But from there you will seek 
DEU.4.30	“When you are in distress and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you will return to 
DEU.4.31	For 
DEU.4.32	“Indeed, ask now about the former days that were before you, from the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of the sky to the other. Has there ever been such a great thing as this, or has anything like it been heard? 
DEU.4.33	Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard—and lived? 
DEU.4.34	Or has any god ever tried to come to take for himself a nation from within a nation—by trials, by signs and wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors—like all that 
DEU.4.35	You were shown, so that you might know that 
DEU.4.36	From the heavens He made you hear His voice to instruct you, and on earth He caused you to see His great fire—you heard His words from the midst of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them. Then He brought you out from Egypt with His presence, by His great power— 
DEU.4.38	to drive out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. 
DEU.4.39	“So you will know today and take to heart that 
DEU.4.40	You must keep His statutes and His 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan, toward the east. 
DEU.4.42	There the manslayer might flee, who kills his neighbor unintentionally and did not hate him previously. He may flee to one of these cities and live: 
DEU.4.43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramot in the Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in the Bashan for the Manassites. 
DEU.4.44	This is the 
DEU.4.45	These are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to 
DEU.4.46	beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and 
DEU.4.47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of the Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan toward the east— 
DEU.4.48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon), 
DEU.4.49	and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, as far as the sea of the Arabah , under the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	Moses called to all Israel and said to them, “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances that I am speaking in your hearing today, learn them and make sure to do them. 
DEU.5.2	 our God cut a covenant with us in Horeb. 
DEU.5.3	Not with our fathers has 
DEU.5.4	 spoke with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire. 
DEU.5.5	(I was standing between 
DEU.5.6	‘I am 
DEU.5.7	‘You shall not have other gods beside Me. 
DEU.5.8	‘Do not make for yourself a graven image—no image of what is in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. 
DEU.5.9	Do not bow down to them or worship them. For I, 
DEU.5.10	but showing lovingkindness to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My 
DEU.5.11	‘You must not take the Name of 
DEU.5.12	‘Observe 
DEU.5.13	Six days you are to labor and do all your work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a 
DEU.5.15	You must remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and 
DEU.5.16	‘Honor your father and your mother just as 
DEU.5.17	‘Do not murder. ‘Do not commit adultery. ‘Do not steal. ‘Do not bear false witness against your neighbor. 
DEU.5.18	‘Do not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’ 
DEU.5.19	“These words 
DEU.5.20	“As soon as you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was blazing with fire, you came near to me—all the heads of your tribes and your elders. 
DEU.5.21	Then you said, ‘
DEU.5.22	Now then, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us! If we hear the voice of 
DEU.5.23	For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
DEU.5.24	You go near and hear all that 
DEU.5.25	“
DEU.5.26	If only there were such a heart in them to fear Me and keep all My 
DEU.5.27	Go say to them, “Return to your tents.” 
DEU.5.28	But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will tell you the whole commandment—both the statutes and the ordinances that you are to teach them. And they will do them in the land I am giving them to possess.’ 
DEU.5.29	“So you must take care to do as 
DEU.5.30	You are to walk in all the way that 
DEU.6.1	“Now this is the commandment, the statutes and ordinances that 
DEU.6.2	so that you might fear 
DEU.6.3	Hear, therefore, O Israel, and take care to do this, so that it may go well with you and you may increase mightily, as 
DEU.6.4	“Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one . 
DEU.6.5	Love 
DEU.6.6	These words, which I am commanding you today, are to be on your heart. 
DEU.6.7	You are to teach them diligently to your children, and speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up. 
DEU.6.8	Bind them as a sign on your hand, they are to be as frontlets between your eyes, 
DEU.6.9	and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
DEU.6.10	“Now when 
DEU.6.11	and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns dug that you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant, and you eat and are full, 
DEU.6.12	then watch yourself so that you do not forget 
DEU.6.13	You must fear 
DEU.6.14	You must not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; 
DEU.6.15	for 
DEU.6.16	“You are not to test 
DEU.6.17	Diligently keep the 
DEU.6.18	You are to do what is right and good in the sight of 
DEU.6.19	to drive out all your enemies from before you, as 
DEU.6.20	“When your son asks you in time to come, saying ‘What are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances that 
DEU.6.21	then you are to tell your son, ‘We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and 
DEU.6.22	Before our eyes 
DEU.6.23	Then He brought us out from there so that He might bring us in, to give us the land that He swore to our fathers. 
DEU.6.24	 commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear 
DEU.6.25	It will be righteousness to us, if we take care to do all this commandment before 
DEU.7.1	“When 
DEU.7.2	and 
DEU.7.3	You are not to intermarry with them—you are not to give your daughter to his son, or take his daughter for your son. 
DEU.7.4	For he will turn your son away from following Me to serve other gods. Then the anger of 
DEU.7.5	Instead, you are to deal with them like this: tear down their altars, smash their pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their carved images with fire. 
DEU.7.6	For you are a holy people to 
DEU.7.7	“It is not because you are more numerous than all the peoples that 
DEU.7.8	Rather, because of His love for you and His keeping the oath He swore to your fathers, 
DEU.7.9	“Know therefore that 
DEU.7.10	but repays those who hate Him to their face, to annihilate them. He will not hesitate with him who hates Him; He will repay him to his face. 
DEU.7.11	Therefore you are to keep the commandment—both the statutes and the ordinances—that I am commanding you today, to do them.
DEU.7.12	“Then it will happen, as a result of your listening to these ordinances, when you keep and do them, that 
DEU.7.13	He will love you, bless you and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the produce of your soil, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you. 
DEU.7.14	From all peoples, you will be blessed—there will not be male or female barren among you or your livestock. 
DEU.7.15	 will remove all sickness from you, and He will not inflict on you any of the terrible diseases of Egypt that you knew, but will inflict them on all who hate you. 
DEU.7.16	“You will devour all the peoples 
DEU.7.17	Suppose you say in your heart, ‘These nations are more numerous than I—how can I drive them out?’ 
DEU.7.18	You are not to be afraid of them. You are to be sure to remember what 
DEU.7.19	the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs and wonders, and the mighty hand and outstretched arm by which 
DEU.7.20	“Moreover, 
DEU.7.21	You should not be terrified of them, since 
DEU.7.22	 your God will drive away those nations before you little by little—you will not be able to put an end to them all at once, or else the beasts of the field will multiply on you. 
DEU.7.23	But 
DEU.7.24	He will hand over their kings to you, and you will blot out their name from under the heavens. No man will stand up to you, until you have destroyed them all. 
DEU.7.25	“The carved images of their gods you are to burn with fire. You are not to covet the silver or gold on them or take it for yourself—or you could be snared by it, for it is an abomination to 
DEU.7.26	You are not to bring an abomination into your house—for you, like it, will be a banned thing. You must utterly detest and utterly abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction.
DEU.8.1	“You are to take care to do the whole 
DEU.8.2	You are to remember all the way that 
DEU.8.3	He afflicted you and let you hunger, then He fed you 
DEU.8.4	Neither did your clothing wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these 40 years. 
DEU.8.5	Now you know in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so 
DEU.8.6	So you are to keep the 
DEU.8.7	For 
DEU.8.8	a land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey, 
DEU.8.9	a land where you will eat bread with no poverty, where you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. 
DEU.8.10	So you will eat and be full, and you will bless 
DEU.8.11	“Take care that you do not forget 
DEU.8.12	Otherwise, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and lived in them, 
DEU.8.13	and when your herds and flocks multiply, and silver and gold multiplies for you and all that is yours multiplies, 
DEU.8.14	then your heart will be haughty and you will forget 
DEU.8.15	He led you through the great and terrible wilderness—fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water. He brought forth water for you from the flinty rock. 
DEU.8.16	He fed you in the wilderness with 
DEU.8.17	You may say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand has made me this wealth.’ 
DEU.8.18	Rather you are to remember 
DEU.8.19	“Now if you do forget 
DEU.8.20	Like the nations 
DEU.9.1	“Hear, O Israel! You are about to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself—cities great and fortified up to the heavens. 
DEU.9.2	The people are great and tall, sons of the Anakim. You know them, and you yourselves have heard, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” 
DEU.9.3	But you will know today that 
DEU.9.4	“After 
DEU.9.5	It is not by your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to possess their land. Rather, because of the wickedness of these nations, 
DEU.9.6	So you should understand that it is not because of your righteousness that 
DEU.9.7	“Remember, never forget, how you provoked 
DEU.9.8	At Horeb you provoked 
DEU.9.9	When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that 
DEU.9.10	 gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God. Moreover, on them were all the words that 
DEU.9.11	“Now at the end of 40 days and 40 nights, 
DEU.9.12	 said to me, ‘Get up! Go quickly down from here, for your people whom you brought out from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves.’ 
DEU.9.13	Furthermore 
DEU.9.14	Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens. Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they.’ 
DEU.9.15	“So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire. Now the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 
DEU.9.16	When I looked, you had indeed sinned against 
DEU.9.17	So I took hold of the two tablets, threw them out of my two hands, and smashed them before your eyes. 
DEU.9.18	“Then I fell down before 
DEU.9.19	For I was afraid of the fierce wrath and fury which 
DEU.9.20	 was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
DEU.9.21	I took your sin—the calf you had made—and burned it in the fire. I crushed it, grinding it up so well that it was as fine as dust, and I threw its dust into the wadi flowing down from the mountain. 
DEU.9.22	“Again at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked 
DEU.9.23	When 
DEU.9.24	You have been rebellious against 
DEU.9.25	“So I threw myself down before 
DEU.9.26	I prayed to 
DEU.9.27	Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people or to their wickedness or their sin. 
DEU.9.28	Otherwise the land from which You brought us out may say, “Because 
DEU.9.29	Yet they are Your people—Your inheritance that You brought out by Your great power and Your outstretched arm.’
DEU.10.1	“At that time 
DEU.10.2	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you smashed, and you are to put them in the ark.’ 
DEU.10.3	“So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. 
DEU.10.4	Like the first inscription, 
DEU.10.5	Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made—and there they are, just as 
DEU.10.6	“(
DEU.10.7	From there they journeyed to Gudgod, and from Gudgod to Jotbah—a land of wadis flowing with water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time 
DEU.10.9	Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers—
DEU.10.10	“I stayed on the mountain like the first time—40 days and 40 nights. 
DEU.10.11	 said to me, ‘Rise up, go, journey ahead of the people so that they may go in and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give to them.’ 
DEU.10.12	“So now, O Israel, what does 
DEU.10.13	to keep the 
DEU.10.14	Behold, to 
DEU.10.15	Only on your fathers did 
DEU.10.16	“Circumcise the foreskin of your heart therefore, and do not be stiff-necked anymore. 
DEU.10.17	For 
DEU.10.18	He enacts justice for the orphan and widow, and loves the outsider, giving him food and clothing. 
DEU.10.19	Therefore love the outsider, for you were outsiders in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	 your God you will fear—Him will you serve. To Him will you cling, and by His Name will you swear. 
DEU.10.21	He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. 
DEU.10.22	Your fathers went down to Egypt with 70 persons, and now 
DEU.11.1	“Therefore you are to love 
DEU.11.2	And you should know this day that it was not your children who knew or saw the discipline of 
DEU.11.3	His signs and the deeds He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to all his land; 
DEU.11.4	and what He did to the army of Egypt, to its horses and chariots when He made the waters of the Sea of Reeds flow over them as they chased after you, and how 
DEU.11.5	what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place; 
DEU.11.6	 and what He did to Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab son of Reuben—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households and tents and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel— 
DEU.11.7	Rather, it is your own eyes that have seen every mighty deed that 
DEU.11.8	“Therefore you are to keep the whole 
DEU.11.9	and so that you may prolong your days on the land that 
DEU.11.10	“For the land you are going in to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you came. There you planted your seed and watered it by foot, like a vegetable garden. 
DEU.11.11	But the land you are crossing over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, drinking from the rain of the heavens it drinks in water. 
DEU.11.12	It is a land that 
DEU.11.13	“Now if you listen obediently to My 
DEU.11.14	then I will give rain for your land in its season—the early rain and the late rain —so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. 
DEU.11.15	I will give grass in your field for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied. 
DEU.11.16	Watch yourselves, so your heart is not deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them. 
DEU.11.17	Then the anger of 
DEU.11.18	“Therefore you are to set these words of Mine in your heart and in your soul. You are to bind them as a sign on your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes. 
DEU.11.19	You are to teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up. 
DEU.11.20	You are to write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, 
DEU.11.21	so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied on the land 
DEU.11.22	“For if you will diligently keep all this ­
DEU.11.23	then 
DEU.11.24	Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be yours—from the wilderness to the Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea will be your border. 
DEU.11.25	No one will be able to stand against you—
DEU.11.26	“See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse— 
DEU.11.27	the blessing, if you listen to the 
DEU.11.28	but the curse, if you do not listen to the 
DEU.11.29	Now when 
DEU.11.30	Are they not across the Jordan toward the west, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah—opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 
DEU.11.31	For you are about to cross over the Jordan to go in to possess the land 
DEU.11.32	and you will take care to do all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today.
DEU.12.1	“These are the statutes and ordinances that you are to make sure to do in the land that 
DEU.12.2	You must utterly destroy all the places where the nations that you will dispossess served their gods—on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree. 
DEU.12.3	You are to tear down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their Asherah poles in the fire and cut down the carved images of their gods, and you are to obliterate their name from that place. 
DEU.12.4	“You are not to act like this toward 
DEU.12.5	Rather you are to seek only the place 
DEU.12.6	There you are to bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes, the offering of your hand, your vow and freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock. 
DEU.12.7	There you and your households will eat before 
DEU.12.8	You will not do all the things as we are doing here today—everyone doing what is right in his own eyes. 
DEU.12.9	For you have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that 
DEU.12.10	But when you cross over the Jordan and settle in the land that 
DEU.12.11	“Then the place 
DEU.12.12	Then you will rejoice before 
DEU.12.13	Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in any place you see. 
DEU.12.14	Rather do so only in the place 
DEU.12.15	“However, you may slaughter and eat meat within all your gates—whatever your soul’s desire, according to the blessing 
DEU.12.16	But you are not to eat the blood—you are to pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.17	You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, or any of your vow offerings that you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the offering of your hand. 
DEU.12.18	Rather you are to eat them before 
DEU.12.19	Be careful that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live on the earth. 
DEU.12.20	“When 
DEU.12.21	If the place 
DEU.12.22	Just as the gazelle or hart is eaten, so you may eat it—the unclean and clean alike may eat it. 
DEU.12.23	Only be sure that you do not eat the blood—for the blood is the life, and you are not to eat the life with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	You are not to eat it—you are to pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.25	You are not to eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, when you do what is right in 
DEU.12.26	“Only the holy things and vow offerings that are yours are you to take and go to the place that 
DEU.12.27	You are to offer your burnt offerings—the flesh and the blood—on the altar of 
DEU.12.28	Take care and listen to all these words that I am commanding you, so that it may go well with you and your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the eyes of 
DEU.12.29	“When 
DEU.12.30	be careful not to be trapped into imitating them after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, saying, ‘How do these nations serve their gods? I will do the same.’ 
DEU.12.31	You are not to act like this toward 
DEU.13.1	“Whatever I command you, you must take care to do—you are not to add to it or take away from it. 
DEU.13.2	“Suppose a prophet or a dreamer of dreams rises up among you and gives you a sign or wonder, 
DEU.13.3	and the sign or wonder he spoke to you comes true, while saying, ‘Let’s follow other gods’—that you have not known, and—‘Let’s serve them!’ 
DEU.13.4	You must not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams—for 
DEU.13.5	 your God you will follow and Him you will fear. His 
DEU.13.6	That prophet or dreamer of dreams must be put to death! For he has spoken falsehood against 
DEU.13.7	“Suppose your brother—your mother’s son—or your son or daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your best friend of your own soul misleads you secretly, saying, ‘Let’s go and serve other gods’—that you and your fathers have not known, 
DEU.13.8	from among the gods of the peoples around you, near you or far off from you, from one end of the earth to the other. 
DEU.13.9	You are not to give in or listen to him, your eye is not to pity him, and you are not to spare or conceal him. 
DEU.13.10	Instead, you will surely put him to death. Your hand should be the first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
DEU.13.11	You are to stone him with stones to death because he tried to entice you away from 
DEU.13.12	Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and never again will they do such an evil thing as this in your midst. 
DEU.13.13	“Suppose you hear it said in one of your cities, which 
DEU.13.14	that worthless fellows have gone out from among you and enticed the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let’s go and serve other gods’—that you have not known. 
DEU.13.15	Then you are to investigate, search out and inquire thoroughly. If indeed it is true and the matter certain that this abomination has been done in your midst, 
DEU.13.16	you will surely strike down the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its livestock with the sword. 
DEU.13.17	You are to gather all its plunder into the middle of the street, and you are to burn with fire the city and all its plunder—all of it to 
DEU.13.18	Nothing from the ban should cling to your hand, so that 
DEU.13.19	when you listen to the voice of 
DEU.14.1	“You are the children of 
DEU.14.2	For you are a holy people to 
DEU.14.3	You are not to eat any detestable thing. 
DEU.14.4	These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 
DEU.14.5	the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep. 
DEU.14.6	Among the animals, you may eat any animal that splits the hoof—the hoof completely split in two—and chews the cud. 
DEU.14.7	Yet of those that chew the cud or have a split hoof, you are not to eat the camel, the hare, and the rabbit—because they chew the cud but do not split the hoof, they are unclean to you. 
DEU.14.8	The pig, because it splits the hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you—you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses. 
DEU.14.9	Of all that are in the waters, these you may eat: whatever has fins and scales you may eat, 
DEU.14.10	but whatever does not have fins and scales you are not to eat—it is unclean to you. 
DEU.14.11	You may eat all clean birds, 
DEU.14.12	but these are the ones you are not to eat: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard, 
DEU.14.13	the red kite, the black kite, and any bird of prey of that kind, 
DEU.14.14	every raven of any kind, 
DEU.14.15	the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, a hawk of any kind, 
DEU.14.16	the little owl, the great owl, the white owl, 
DEU.14.17	the pelican, the Egyptian vulture, the cormorant, 
DEU.14.18	the stork, a heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
DEU.14.19	All winged insects are unclean to you—they are not to be eaten. 
DEU.14.20	You may eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.21	You are not to eat anything that dies of itself. You may give it to the outsider within your gates so that he may eat it or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people to 
DEU.14.22	“You will surely set aside a tenth of all the yield of your seed that comes from the field year by year. 
DEU.14.23	You are to eat the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and flock, before 
DEU.14.24	Now suppose the way is too long for you, for you cannot carry the tithe because the place 
DEU.14.25	then you are to exchange the tithe for silver, bind up the silver in your hand, and go to the place that 
DEU.14.26	You may spend the money for whatever your soul desires—cattle, sheep, wine, strong drink, or whatever your soul asks of you. Then you will eat there before 
DEU.14.27	But you are not to neglect the Levite within your gates, for he has no portion or inheritance with you. 
DEU.14.28	At the end of every three years, you are to bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year and store it within your gates. 
DEU.14.29	Then the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, along with the outsider, the orphan and the widow within your gates, will come and eat and be satisfied, so that 
DEU.15.1	“At the end of every seven years you are to cancel debts. 
DEU.15.2	This is how you are to cancel debts: every creditor is to release what he has loaned to his neighbor. He must not force his neighbor or his brother to repay, for 
DEU.15.3	A foreigner you may force, but your hand is to release whatever your brother owes you. 
DEU.15.4	“However, there should be no poor among you, for 
DEU.15.5	If only you would carefully listen to the voice of 
DEU.15.6	For 
DEU.15.7	“If there is a poor man among you—any of your brothers within any of your gates in your land that 
DEU.15.8	Rather, you must surely open your hand to him and you must surely lend him enough for his need—whatever he is lacking. 
DEU.15.9	Watch yourself, so there is no unworthy thing in your heart saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of cancelling debts, is near,’ and your eye is evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing. Then he may call out to 
DEU.15.10	You must surely give to him, and your heart is not to be grieved when you give to him—for because of this thing 
DEU.15.11	“For there will never cease to be poor people in the land. Therefore I am commanding you, saying, ‘You must surely open your hand to your brother—to your needy and poor in your land.’ 
DEU.15.12	“If your fellow Hebrew—a man or woman—is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you are to set him free. 
DEU.15.13	When you set him free, you are not to send him away empty-handed. 
DEU.15.14	You are to surely provide for him from your flock and threshing floor and winepress. As 
DEU.15.15	You will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and 
DEU.15.16	“Now if he tells you, ‘I will not go away from you’—because he loves you and your household since he is well off with you— 
DEU.15.17	then you are to take an awl and put it through his ear to the door, and he will be your servant forever. And to your female slave you are to do the same. 
DEU.15.18	It should not seem hard to you when you set him free from you, for he has served you six years—double the value of a hired worker. So 
DEU.15.19	“All the firstborn males that are born in your herd and your flock you are to consecrate to 
DEU.15.20	You are to eat it before 
DEU.15.21	But if it has any blemish—if it is lame or blind or has any serious blemish—you are not to sacrifice it to 
DEU.15.22	You are to eat it within your gates, the unclean and the clean together, just as they eat the gazelle or deer. 
DEU.15.23	Only its blood you are not to eat—you must pour it out on the ground like water.
DEU.16.1	“Observe the month of Aviv and keep the Passover to 
DEU.16.2	You are to sacrifice the Passover offering to 
DEU.16.3	You are not to eat 
DEU.16.4	No 
DEU.16.5	You may not sacrifice the Passover offering within any of your gates that 
DEU.16.6	Rather, at the place 
DEU.16.7	You are to cook and eat it at the place 
DEU.16.8	For six days you are to eat 
DEU.16.9	Seven weeks you are to count for yourself—from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you will begin to count seven weeks. 
DEU.16.10	Then you will keep the Feast of 
DEU.16.11	So you will rejoice before 
DEU.16.12	You will remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you are to take care and do these statutes. 
DEU.16.13	“You are to keep the Feast of 
DEU.16.14	So you will rejoice in your feast—you, your son and daughter, slave and maid, Levite and outsider, orphan and widow within your gates. 
DEU.16.15	Seven days you will feast to 
DEU.16.16	Three times a year all your males are to appear before 
DEU.16.17	the gift of each man’s hand according to the blessing 
DEU.16.18	“Judges and officers you are to appoint within all your gates that 
DEU.16.19	You are not to twist justice—you must not show partiality or take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and distorts the words of the righteous. 
DEU.16.20	Justice, justice you must pursue, so that you may live and possess the land that 
DEU.16.21	You are not to plant for yourself an Asherah pole of any kind of wood beside the altar of 
DEU.16.22	Nor are you to set up a pillar for yourself—
DEU.17.1	“You are not to sacrifice to 
DEU.17.2	Suppose there is found in your midst—within one of your gates that 
DEU.17.3	This person goes and serves other gods and worships them—the sun or moon or any of the heavenly host, which I have not commanded. 
DEU.17.4	It is told to you and you have heard about it, and you investigate thoroughly and indeed it is true and the thing certain—this abomination has been done in Israel. 
DEU.17.5	Then you are to bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and stone that man or woman with stones to death. 
DEU.17.6	By the word of two or three witnesses, the one who is to die is to be put to death. No one is to be put to death by the word of one witness. 
DEU.17.7	The hand of the witnesses is to be first to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you are to purge the evil from your midst. 
DEU.17.8	“Suppose a matter arises that is too hard for you to judge—over bloodshed, legal claims or assault—matters of controversy within your gates. Then you should go up to the place 
DEU.17.9	and come to the Levitical 
DEU.17.10	You are to act according to the sentence they tell you from that place 
DEU.17.11	You are to act according to the instruction they teach you and the judgment they tell you—you must not turn aside from the sentence they tell you, to the right or to the left. 
DEU.17.12	The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the 
DEU.17.13	Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and not act presumptuously again.
DEU.17.14	“When you come to the land that 
DEU.17.15	you will indeed set over yourselves a king, whom 
DEU.17.16	Only he should not multiply horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to multiply horses, because 
DEU.17.17	Nor should he multiply wives for himself, so that his heart does not turn aside, nor multiply much silver and gold for himself. 
DEU.17.18	“Now when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself a copy of this 
DEU.17.19	It will remain with him, and he will read in it all the days of his life, in order to learn to fear 
DEU.17.20	Then his heart will not be exalted above his brothers, and he will not turn from the commandment to the right or to the left—so that he may prolong his days in his kingship, he and his sons, in the midst of Israel.
DEU.18.1	“The Levitical 
DEU.18.2	They will have no inheritance among their brothers—
DEU.18.3	So this will be the share due to the 
DEU.18.4	The firstfruits of your grain, of your new wine, of your oil, and the first fleece of your sheep, you are to give him. 
DEU.18.5	For 
DEU.18.6	“Suppose a Levite comes from one of your towns, wherever he is living in all of Israel, and he comes whenever his soul desires to the place 
DEU.18.7	and serves in the Name of 
DEU.18.8	They are to eat equal portions, regardless of their fathers’ goods.
DEU.18.9	When you enter the land 
DEU.18.10	There must not be found among you anyone who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire, or a fortune-teller, soothsayer, omen reader, or sorcerer, 
DEU.18.11	or one who casts spells, or a medium, a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. 
DEU.18.12	For whoever does these things is an abomination to 
DEU.18.13	You are to be blameless before 
DEU.18.14	“For these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to soothsayers and fortune-tellers, but as for you, 
DEU.18.15	“
DEU.18.16	This is just what you asked of 
DEU.18.17	“
DEU.18.18	I will raise up a prophet like you for them from among their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will speak to them all that I command him. 
DEU.18.19	Now whoever does not listen to My words that this prophet speaks in My Name, I Myself will call him to account. 
DEU.18.20	But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My Name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods—that prophet will die.’ 
DEU.18.21	“Now should you say in your heart, ‘How would we recognize the word that 
DEU.18.22	When a prophet speaks in 
DEU.19.1	“When 
DEU.19.2	you are to set apart three cities for yourself within the land He is giving you to possess. 
DEU.19.3	You are to prepare the way for yourself and divide into three parts the borders of your land that 
DEU.19.4	Now this is the case of the one who kills, who may flee there and live—whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally and did not hate him in the past— 
DEU.19.5	as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand takes a swing with the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron flies off the wood and hits his neighbor so that he dies. He may flee to one of these cities and live. 
DEU.19.6	Otherwise if the way is long, the avenger of the blood, while his heart is hot, may chase the manslayer, catch up to him and strike him dead. Yet no death sentence is on him, since he did not hate him in the past. 
DEU.19.7	Therefore I am commanding you—set apart three cities for yourself. 
DEU.19.8	“Suppose 
DEU.19.9	when you take care to do all this 
DEU.19.10	Then innocent blood will not be shed within your land that 
DEU.19.11	“But suppose someone hates his neighbor, waits in hiding for him, rises up against him, strikes him dead, then flees to one of these cities. 
DEU.19.12	Then the elders of his hometown should send and take him from there and hand him over to the avenger of blood, to die. 
DEU.19.13	Your eye should not pity him, but you must purge the innocent blood from Israel, so that it may go well with you. 
DEU.19.14	“You must not move your neighbor’s boundary marker that the first generations marked out, in the inheritance you will receive in the land 
DEU.19.15	A single witness shall not rise up against a person for any offense or sin that he commits. By the word of two or three witnesses is a case to be established. 
DEU.19.16	Suppose a hostile witness rises up against someone to accuse him of wrongdoing. 
DEU.19.17	Then both people who have the dispute will stand before 
DEU.19.18	The judges are to investigate thoroughly, and if indeed the witness is a false witness and has testified falsely against his brother, 
DEU.19.19	then you are to do to him just as he had plotted to do to his brother. So you will purge the evil from your midst. 
DEU.19.20	Those who remain will hear and be afraid, and they will no longer do such an evil thing as this in your midst. 
DEU.19.21	Your eye must not show pity—life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU.20.1	“When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horse and chariot—a people more numerous than you—do not be afraid of them. For 
DEU.20.2	When you draw near to the battle, the 
DEU.20.3	He will say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel, you are drawing near today to the battle against your enemies. Don’t be fainthearted! Don’t fear or panic or tremble because of them. 
DEU.20.4	For 
DEU.20.5	“The officers are to speak to the troops saying, ‘What man has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house—otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would dedicate it. 
DEU.20.6	What man has planted a vineyard but has not put it to use? Let him go back to his house—otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would begin to use it. 
DEU.20.7	What man has become engaged to a woman but has not married her? Let him go back to his house—otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would marry her.’ 
DEU.20.8	The officers will speak further to the troops and say, ‘What man is afraid and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house—so he does not weaken his brothers’ heart like his own.’ 
DEU.20.9	Then when the officers have finished speaking to the troops, they should appoint army commanders at the head of the troops. 
DEU.20.10	“When you go near a city to fight against it, call out 
DEU.20.11	Now if it answers you 
DEU.20.12	If it does not make peace with you but makes war against you, then lay siege against that city. 
DEU.20.13	When 
DEU.20.14	Only the women, children, livestock and all that is in the city—all its spoil—may you take as plunder for yourself. So you may consume your enemies’ spoil, which 
DEU.20.15	Thus you will do to all the cities that are very distant from you, which are not among the towns of these nations nearby. 
DEU.20.16	However, only from the cities of these peoples, which 
DEU.20.17	You must utterly destroy them—the Hittites , the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites and the Jebusites—just as 
DEU.20.18	You are to do this so they will not teach you to do all the abominations as they have done for their gods, and so you would sin against 
DEU.20.19	“When you lay siege to a city for a long time, making war against it to capture it, you are not to destroy its trees by swinging an axe at them. For from them you may eat, so you shall not chop them down. For is the tree of the field human, that it should enter the siege before you? 
DEU.20.20	You may destroy and chop down only the trees that you know are not trees for food, so that you may build siege equipment against the city that is making war with you until its downfall.
DEU.21.1	“Suppose a slain person is found fallen in a field, on the land 
DEU.21.2	Then your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance to the towns that are around the slain one. 
DEU.21.3	Now the town nearest to the slain one—the elders of that city are to take from the herd a heifer that has not been used for work or pulled a yoke. 
DEU.21.4	Then the elders of that city are to bring the heifer down to a flowing wadi that has not been plowed or sown, and break the heifer’s neck there in the wadi. 
DEU.21.5	The 
DEU.21.6	All the elders of that city nearest to the slain one will wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi. 
DEU.21.7	Then they will answer and say, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see. 
DEU.21.8	Grant atonement for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, 
DEU.21.9	So you will purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in 
DEU.21.10	“When you go out to war against your enemies, and 
DEU.21.11	suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire her and would take her as a wife for yourself. 
DEU.21.12	Then you are to bring her into your house, and she must shave her head, trim her nails, 
DEU.21.13	and remove her captive’s clothing, then sit in your house and weep for her father and mother a full month. After that, you may go to her and become her husband and she will be your wife. 
DEU.21.14	Now if you are not pleased with her, then you may send her off wherever she wishes. But you must certainly not sell her for silver—you may not treat her as merchandise, since you have humiliated her. 
DEU.21.15	“Suppose a man has two wives—the one loved and the other unloved—and both the loved and the unloved bear him sons. But it happens that the firstborn son belongs to the unloved wife. 
DEU.21.16	Now on the day he lets his sons inherit what he has, he must not treat the loved one’s son as firstborn, in place of the unloved one’s son, who is the firstborn. 
DEU.21.17	Rather, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated one, by giving him a double portion of all that he has. For he is the first of his vigor—the right of the firstborn is his. 
DEU.21.18	“Suppose a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not listen to the voice of his father or mother. They discipline him, but he does not listen to them. 
DEU.21.19	Then his father and mother are to grab hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city—to the gate of his place. 
DEU.21.20	They will say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious—he does not listen to our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ 
DEU.21.21	Then all the men of his city are to stone him with stones to death. So you will purge the evil from your midst—and all Israel will hear and be afraid.
DEU.21.22	“Suppose a man is guilty of a sin with a death sentence and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree. 
DEU.21.23	His body is not to remain all night on the tree—instead you must certainly bury him the same day, for anyone hanged is a curse of God. You must not defile your land that 
DEU.22.1	“You are not to watch your brother’s ox or sheep going astray and ignore them —you must certainly bring them back to your brother. 
DEU.22.2	If your brother is not near you or if you do not know him, then you should bring it into your house and it will remain with you until your brother comes searching for it and you return it to him. 
DEU.22.3	You are to do the same with his donkey or his coat or anything lost by your brother, that may be lost by him and you find—you may not ignore them. 
DEU.22.4	You must not watch your brother’s donkey or ox fall down on the road and ignore it—you must certainly help him lift it up again. 
DEU.22.5	“A man’s apparel is not to be on a woman, nor is a man to wear woman’s clothing—for whoever does these things is detestable to 
DEU.22.6	“If there happens to be a bird’s nest in front of you along the road, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the hen sitting on the young or on the eggs, you are not to take the hen with the young. 
DEU.22.7	You must certainly let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself so that it may go well with you and you may prolong your days. 
DEU.22.8	“When you build a new house, you are to make a guardrail for your roof, so that you do not bring the guilt of blood on your house if anyone falls from it. 
DEU.22.9	“You are not to plant your vineyard with two kinds of seed, or else the whole harvest will be forfeited —both the seed you plant and the produce of the vineyard. 
DEU.22.10	You are not to plow with an ox and a donkey together. 
DEU.22.11	You are not to wear a woven mixture , wool and linen together. 
DEU.22.12	You are to make for yourself twisted threads on the four corners of your garment in which you cover yourself. 
DEU.22.13	“Suppose a man takes a wife and goes t0 her and then dislikes her, 
DEU.22.14	accuses her of shameful things and gives her a bad reputation by saying, ‘I took this woman, but when I came near her, I didn’t find her virginity.’ 
DEU.22.15	Then the father of the young woman is to take her and her mother is to bring out the signs of the young woman’s virginity to the city elders at the gate. 
DEU.22.16	The young lady’s father is to tell the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he hates her. 
DEU.22.17	Indeed, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, “I didn’t find your daughter’s virginity.” Yet these are the signs of my daughter’s virginity.’ They are to spread the wedding cloth before the elders of the city. 
DEU.22.18	The elders of that city are to take the man and punish him. 
DEU.22.19	Then they are to fine him 100 pieces of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought an evil name on a virgin of Israel. Then she is to be his wife—he may not send her away all his days. 
DEU.22.20	“But if this thing is true—that the signs of virginity were not found in the young lady— 
DEU.22.21	then they are to bring the young woman out to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city are to stone her with stones to death, because she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel, to behave like a prostitute in her father’s house. So you are to purge the evil from your midst. 
DEU.22.22	“Suppose a man is found lying with a married woman. Then both of them are to die—the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you are to purge the evil from Israel. 
DEU.22.23	“Suppose there is a young woman who is a virgin engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and lies with her. 
DEU.22.24	Then you are to bring them both out to the gate of that city and stone them with stones to death—the young woman because she did not cry out in the town, and the man because he humiliated his neighbor’s wife. So you are to purge the evil from your midst. 
DEU.22.25	“But if the man finds the engaged woman in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her is to die. 
DEU.22.26	But to the young woman you are to do nothing—there is no sin in the young woman deserving of death. For this matter is the same as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him— 
DEU.22.27	for he found her in the field, the engaged woman cried out, and there was no one to save her. 
DEU.22.28	“Suppose a man finds a young virgin who is not engaged, grabs her and lies with her, and they are discovered. 
DEU.22.29	Then the man who lay with her is to give to the young woman’s father 50 pieces of silver, and she is to be his wife, since he has humiliated her—he may not send her away all his days. 
DEU.23.1	“A man is not to take his father’s wife—he is not to expose his father’s nakedness. 
DEU.23.2	“No one with crushed or cut-off genitals is to enter the community of

DEU.23.11	If there is among you a man who is not clean from a nighttime emission, he is to go outside the camp—he may not reenter the camp. 
DEU.23.12	Now toward evening he is to bathe in water, and when the sun sets, he may reenter the camp. 
DEU.23.13	There is to be a place at hand for you outside the camp, and you are to go there outside. 
DEU.23.14	You are to have a shovel for yourself among your weapons. Now when you sit down outside, you are to dig with it and turn and cover up what comes out of you. 
DEU.23.15	For 
DEU.23.16	“You are not to hand over to his master a slave who seeks refuge with you from his master. 
DEU.23.17	Let him dwell with you in your midst, in the place he chooses within one of your town gates—the one that is good for him. You are not to mistreat him.

DEU.24.1	“Suppose a man takes a wife and marries her. Now if she doesn’t find favor in his eyes because he has found something indecent in her, he is to write her a certificate of divorce, hand it to her and send her out from his house. 
DEU.24.2	When she leaves his house, she may go and become another man’s wife. 
DEU.24.3	Now suppose the second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, and he hands it to her and she leaves his house—or suppose the second husband who took her to be his wife dies. 
DEU.24.4	Then her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has been defiled—for that would be detestable before 
DEU.24.5	“When a man takes a new wife, he is not to go out with the army or have any duty passed over to him. He is to be free at home for one year and make his wife happy.

DEU.24.12	If he is a poor man, you are not to sleep with his pledge . 
DEU.24.13	You must certainly restore the pledge to him when the sun sets, so that he may sleep in his coat and bless you—and it is to be righteousness for you before 
DEU.24.14	“You are not to oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is from your brothers or the outsiders in your land within your town gates.

DEU.25.1	“Suppose there is a dispute between people and they approach the court, the judges hear their case, and declare one righteous and the other guilty. 
DEU.25.2	Now if the guilty one deserves to be flogged, the judge is to make him lie down and be flogged before him, with the number of lashes in proportion to his guilt.

DEU.25.6	Now the firstborn that she bears is to carry on the name of his dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out of Israel. 
DEU.25.7	But if the man does not want to take his brother’s widow, his brother’s widow is to go to the elders at the gate and say, ‘My brother-in-law refuses to carry on his brother’s name in Israel—he is unwilling to perform a brother-in-law’s duty for me.’ 
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his town are to summon him and speak to him. And if he stands firm and says, ‘I do not desire to take her,’ 
DEU.25.9	then his brother’s widow is to come to him in the sight of the elders, pull his sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and reply, ‘So will it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.’ 
DEU.25.10	Then his name is to be called in Israel ‘the house of the pulled-off sandal.’ 
DEU.25.11	“Suppose people fight with one another, a man and his brother, and the wife of the one approaches to rescue her husband from the hand of the one hitting him; and she puts out her hand and grabs him by his genitals.

DEU.25.14	You are not to have in your house ephahs of different measures—large and small. 
DEU.25.15	You must have a full and honest weight and a full and honest measure, so that your days may be long on the land that

DEU.25.18	how he happened upon you along the way and attacked those among you in the rear, all the stragglers behind you, when you were tired and weary—he did not fear God. 
DEU.25.19	Now when

DEU.26.14	I have not eaten from the tithe in my mourning, or removed any of it while unclean, or given any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the voice of

DEU.31.6	! Be courageous! Do not be afraid or tremble before them. For

DEU.31.8	—He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you. Do not fear or be discouraged.” 
DEU.31.9	Moses wrote down this

DEU.31.11	when all Israel comes to appear before 
DEU.31.12	Gather the people—the men and women and little ones, and the outsider within your town gates—so they may hear and so they may learn, and they will fear

DEU.31.15	 appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the opening of the Tent. 
DEU.31.16	 said to Moses, “Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise up and prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will abandon Me and break My covenant that I cut with them. 
DEU.31.17	Then My anger will flare against them on that day, and I will abandon them and hide My face from them. So they will be devoured, and many evils and troubles will come on them. They will say on that day, ‘Isn’t it because our God is not among us that these evils have come on us?’ 
DEU.31.18	I will surely hide My face on that day because of all the evil they have done, for they have turned to other gods.
DEU.31.19	“Now, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to

DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly and turn aside from the way I have commanded you. So evil will fall upon you in the latter days, because you will do what is evil in the sight of 
DEU.31.30	Moses spoke in the hearing of the whole community of Israel the words of this song, right to the end:
DEU.32.1	“Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak! Let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
DEU.32.2	May my teaching trickle like rain, my speech distill like dew— like gentle rain on new grass, like showers on tender plants. 
DEU.32.3	For I will proclaim 
DEU.32.4	The Rock—blameless is His work. Indeed, all His ways are just. God of faithfulness without iniquity, righteous and upright is He. 
DEU.32.5	Did it corrupt Him? No! The blemish is His children’s— a generation crooked and twisted. 
DEU.32.6	Is this how you pay back 
DEU.32.7	“Remember the days of antiquity, understand the years across generations. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders and they will say to you. 
DEU.32.8	When Elyon gave nations their heritage, when He separated the sons of man, He set boundaries for the people by the number of 
DEU.32.9	But 
DEU.32.10	He found him in the wilderness land, in the void of a howling waste. He surrounded him, cared for him, guarded him as the pupil of His eye. 
DEU.32.11	As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, He spreads His wings, catches him, lifts him up on His pinions. 
DEU.32.12	 alone guided him— there was no foreign god with him. 
DEU.32.13	He made him mount the heights of the land. so he ate the produce of the field. He suckled him with honey from a rock, with oil from a flinty boulder. 
DEU.32.14	Butter of cattle and milk of a flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the Bashan and he-goats, with fat of the kidneys of wheat, and blood of grapes you drank. 
DEU.32.15	But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked— you got fat, you grew thick, you gorged! He forsook God who made him. He mocked the Rock of his salvation. 
DEU.32.16	They made him jealous with strangers, with abominations they angered Him. 
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed to demons, a non-god, gods they had not known— to new ones who came in lately, ones your fathers had not dreaded. 
DEU.32.18	The Rock who birthed you, you ignored. You forgot God who brought you forth. 
DEU.32.19	“
DEU.32.20	He said, “I will hide My face from them, I want to see their hereafter. For they are an upside down generation, children with no faithfulness in them. 
DEU.32.21	They made Me jealous with a non-god. They vexed Me with airy idols. So I will make them jealous with a non-people. With a foolish nation I will vex them. 
DEU.32.22	For fire has ignited in My nostrils— it will burn to 
DEU.32.23	I will heap calamities upon them. With My arrows I will finish them. 
DEU.32.24	Wasted by famine, ravaged by plague and pestilence so bitter, fangs of beasts I’ll let loose on them, with venom of creepers in the dust. 
DEU.32.25	Outside the sword deals death, and inside terror— to both young men and young women, infants, with men of gray hair. 
DEU.32.26	I would have said, ‘I will hack them to pieces, make the memory of them cease from mankind,’ 
DEU.32.27	except I dread the taunt of the enemy, lest their foes might misconstrue— lest they say, ‘Our hand is held high, and 
DEU.32.28	For they are a nation lacking counsel, among them there is no understanding. 
DEU.32.29	“If they were wise, they would discern this, they would understand their hereafter. 
DEU.32.30	How can one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them and 
DEU.32.31	Surely their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies judge. 
DEU.32.32	For their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the terraces of Gomorrah. Its grapes are grapes of poison— bitter clusters on it. 
DEU.32.33	Venom of serpents is their wine— poison of vipers so cruel. 
DEU.32.34	Is it not stored up with Me, sealed up in My treasuries? 
DEU.32.35	Vengeance is Mine, and payback, for the time when their foot staggers. Surely their day of disaster is near— what is prepared rushes on them. 
DEU.32.36	For 
DEU.32.37	He will say, ‘Where are their gods, the “rock” they took refuge in? 
DEU.32.38	Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libation? Let them rise up and help you and be a shelter over you! 
DEU.32.39	See now that I, I am He! There are no other gods beside Me. I bring death and give life, I have wounded but I will heal, and none can rescue from My hand.’ 
DEU.32.40	“Yes, I lift My hand up to heaven and say, ‘As I Myself live forever, 
DEU.32.41	when I sharpen My lightning sword and My hand seizes it in judgment, I will return vengeance on My foes, and those who hate Me I will pay back. 
DEU.32.42	I will make My arrows drunk from blood, and My sword will devour flesh— the blood of the slain and the captive, the head of the leaders of the enemy.’ 
DEU.32.43	Make His people rejoice, O nations, for He will avenge the blood of His servants. He will return vengeance on His foes, and atone for the land of His people.” 
DEU.32.44	Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people—he and Joshua son of Nun. 
DEU.32.45	When Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he said to them, “Put in your hearts all the words that I call as witness against you today—that you may command your children to keep and do all the words of this 
DEU.32.47	For it is not an empty thing for you, because it is your life! By this word you will prolong your days on the land, which you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.” 
DEU.32.48	On that very day, 
DEU.32.49	“Go up this mountain of the Avarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab facing Jericho, and see the land of Canaan, which I am giving to 
DEU.32.50	On the mountain that you are ascending, there be gathered to your people—as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people— 
DEU.32.51	because you both broke faith with Me among 
DEU.32.52	For you will see the land from afar, but you will not enter there, into the land that I am giving to 
DEU.33.1	This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed 
DEU.33.2	He said, “
DEU.33.3	Indeed, a lover of peoples is He— all His 
DEU.33.4	 Moses commanded us— a heritage for the community of Jacob. 
DEU.33.5	He became king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people gathered, all the tribes of Israel together. 
DEU.33.6	‘Let Reuben live and not die, though his people become few.’ 
DEU.33.7	Now this is for Judah. He said, ‘Hear, 
DEU.33.8	For Levi he said, ‘Let Your Thummim and Urim be with Your pious man. You tested him at Massah, You strived with him at the waters of Meribah.’ 
DEU.33.9	He said of his father and mother, “I have not seen them,” nor did he acknowledge his brothers or recognize his children. For they observed Your word and kept Your covenant. 
DEU.33.10	They will teach Jacob Your judgments and Israel Your 
DEU.33.11	, bless his resources, find favor in the work of his hands. Crush the loins of those who rise against him and hate him, so they do not rise again.’ 
DEU.33.12	For Benjamin he said, ‘The beloved of 
DEU.33.13	For Joseph he said, ‘May his land be blessed by 
DEU.33.14	and with the bounty of the sun’s produce and the months’ yield, 
DEU.33.15	and with the best from the ancient mountains and the bounty of the everlasting hills, 
DEU.33.16	with earth’s bounty and its fullness and the favor of the One dwelling in the bush. May it come on Joseph’s head, on the crown of the prince among his brothers. 
DEU.33.17	The firstborn ox—majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he gores peoples, all at once, to the ends of the earth. They are the myriads of Ephraim, they are the thousands of Manasseh.’ 
DEU.33.18	For Zebulun he said, ‘Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar, in your tents. 
DEU.33.19	Peoples they call to the mountain— there they offer righteous sacrifices. For they suckle the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.’ 
DEU.33.20	For Gad he said, ‘Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad. Like a lion he crouches, and tears off an arm or even the crown of a head. 
DEU.33.21	He chose the best for himself, for there a marked portion was reserved. He came with the heads of the people. He carried out 
DEU.33.22	For Dan he said, ‘Dan is a lion’s cub leaping out of the Bashan.’ 
DEU.33.23	For Naphtali he said, ‘O Naphtali, satisfied with favor and full of the blessing of 
DEU.33.24	For Asher he said, ‘Most blessed of sons is Asher — may he be the favorite of his brothers, and may he dip his foot in oil. 
DEU.33.25	The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze. As your days, so will your strength be.’ 
DEU.33.26	“There is none like God, Jeshurun, riding through the heavens to your aid and through the skies in His majesty. 
DEU.33.27	A refuge is the ancient God, and underneath are everlasting arms. He drove out the enemy before you and said, ‘Destroy!’ 
DEU.33.28	So Israel rests in safety, untroubled is Jacob’s fountain in a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drip dew. 
DEU.33.29	Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by 
DEU.34.1	Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. 
DEU.34.2	and all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, 
DEU.34.3	the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	Then 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of 
DEU.34.6	Then He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor—but no one knows of his burial place to this day. 
DEU.34.7	Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eye was not dim nor his vigor gone. 
DEU.34.8	 wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping, mourning for Moses, were ended. 
DEU.34.9	Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So 
DEU.34.10	There has not risen again a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom 
DEU.34.11	with all the signs and wonders 
DEU.34.12	by the strong hand and great awe that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of 
JOS.1.2	“My servant Moses is dead. So now, arise, you and all these people, cross over this Jordan to the land that I am giving to them—to 
JOS.1.3	Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I am giving to you, as I spoke to Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the Euphrates River—all the land of the Hittites— to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory. 
JOS.1.5	No one will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake you. 
JOS.1.6	! Be strong! For you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be very strong, and resolute to observe diligently the 
JOS.1.8	This book of the 
JOS.1.9	Have I not commanded you? 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officials of the people saying: 
JOS.1.11	“Go through the camp and charge the people saying: ‘Prepare provisions, for within three days you will be crossing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which 
JOS.1.12	Then Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, Gadites and half-tribe of Manasseh saying: 
JOS.1.13	“Remember the word that Moses the servant of 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones and your cattle will remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you will cross over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and will help them 
JOS.1.15	until 
JOS.1.16	Then they answered Joshua saying: “All that you have commanded us, we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, he will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”
JOS.2.1	Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent out two spies from Shittim saying: “Go, explore the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and came to the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and lodged there. 
JOS.2.2	The king of Jericho was told, “Some men from 
JOS.2.3	So the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab saying: “Bring out the men who came to you, who entered your house—for they have come to spy out all the land.” 
JOS.2.4	But the woman took the two men and hid them, and said: “Yes, the men did come to me, but I didn’t know where they were from. 
JOS.2.5	So when it was time to shut the gate at dark, the men went out, and I don’t know where they went. Pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.” 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax that she had spread out on the roof. 
JOS.2.7	So the men pursued them on the road to the fords of the Jordan. As soon as the pursuers had gone out, they shut the gate. 
JOS.2.8	Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, 
JOS.2.9	and she said to the men: “I know that 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how 
JOS.2.11	When we heard about it, our hearts melted, and no spirit remained any more in anyone because of you. For 
JOS.2.12	So now, please swear to me by 
JOS.2.13	that you will spare the lives of my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters and all who belong to them, and save our lives from death.” 
JOS.2.14	The men said to her: “Our life for yours, if you don’t report this business of ours. Then it will be when 
JOS.2.15	So she lowered them down by a rope through the window—for her house was in the wall; she was living in the wall. 
JOS.2.16	Then she said to them: “Go to the hill country, lest the pursuers meet you, and hide yourselves there for three days, until the pursuers return. Afterward, you may go your way.” 
JOS.2.17	Then the men said to her: “We will be released from this oath that you have made us swear, 
JOS.2.18	unless when we come into the land, you tie this line of scarlet thread in the window through which you lowered us down, and gather to yourself in the house your father, your mother, your brothers and all your father’s household—
JOS.2.19	whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head and we will be innocent, but whoever is with you in the house, his blood will be on our head if any hand is laid on him. 
JOS.2.20	But if you divulge this business of ours, then we will be released from your oath you have made us swear.” 
JOS.2.21	So she said: “According to your words, so be it.” Then she sent them away. After they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord to the window. 
JOS.2.22	Then they departed and came to the hill country. They stayed there for three days until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had looked for them all along the road, but had not found them. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men returned, came down from the hill country, crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun. They reported to him all that had befallen them. 
JOS.2.24	“Surely 
JOS.3.1	Then Joshua rose up early in the morning, and he and all 
JOS.3.2	Now it came about after three days that the officials went through the camp 
JOS.3.3	and they charged the people saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of 
JOS.3.4	Yet keep a distance between you and it of about 2,000 cubits by measure. Don’t come near it, so you may know the way by which you should go, for you haven’t travelled this way before.” 
JOS.3.5	Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow 
JOS.3.6	Joshua spoke to the 
JOS.3.7	Now 
JOS.3.8	You are to command the 
JOS.3.9	So Joshua said to 
JOS.3.10	Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is among you, and that He will certainly drive out from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite and the Jebusite. 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Sovereign of all the earth is advancing before you into the Jordan. 
JOS.3.12	So now, take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe. 
JOS.3.13	It will come to pass when the soles of the feet of the 
JOS.3.14	So it came to pass. When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the 
JOS.3.15	Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as those who were carrying the ark came into the Jordan and the feet of the 
JOS.3.16	the waters which were flowing down from above stood and rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the town next to Zarethan. What was flowing down to the sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	Yet the 
JOS.4.1	Now when all the nation had finished crossing over the Jordan, 
JOS.4.2	“Take for yourself twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, 
JOS.4.3	and command them saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the feet of the 
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from 
JOS.4.5	Joshua said to them, “Cross over before the ark of 
JOS.4.6	Let this be a sign among you. When your children ask later saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’ 
JOS.4.7	then you will say to them: ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of 
JOS.4.8	So 
JOS.4.9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the spot where the feet of the 
JOS.4.10	The 
JOS.4.11	and when all the people had finished crossing over, the ark of 
JOS.4.12	Also the children of Reuben, the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed ahead of 
JOS.4.13	about 40,000 equipped for war crossed over before 
JOS.4.14	On that day 
JOS.4.15	Then 
JOS.4.16	“Command the 
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the 
JOS.4.18	As soon as the 
JOS.4.19	Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	Those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	Then he said to 
JOS.4.22	then you will inform your children saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’ 
JOS.4.23	For 
JOS.4.24	so that all the peoples of the earth may know 
JOS.5.1	Now it came about when all the Amorite kings beyond the Jordan westward and all the Canaanite kings by the sea heard how 
JOS.5.2	At that time 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised 
JOS.5.4	Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised: all the people that came out of Egypt who were males—all the men of war—had died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	Though all the people that came out were circumcised, none of the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	For 
JOS.5.7	But He raised up their children in their place. Joshua circumcised them, for they were uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way. 
JOS.5.8	Now it came to pass after they had finished circumcising the entire nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they recovered. 
JOS.5.9	Then 
JOS.5.10	While 
JOS.5.11	On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, 
JOS.5.12	Then the 
JOS.5.13	Now it came to pass when Joshua was near Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man standing in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua approached him and said to him: “Are you for us or for our adversaries?” 
JOS.5.14	“Neither,” he said. “Rather, I have now come as commander of 
JOS.5.15	Then the commander of 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of 
JOS.6.2	Then 
JOS.6.3	Now you are to march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. So you are to do for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Seven 
JOS.6.5	It will be when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, when you hear the sound of the 
JOS.6.6	So Joshua son of Nun summoned the 
JOS.6.7	Then he said to the people, “Move forward, march around the city, and let the armed force march ahead of the ark of 
JOS.6.8	And it was so. After Joshua had spoken to the people, seven 
JOS.6.9	Also the armed force went before the 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua ordered the people saying: “You must not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you ‘shout!’ Then you will shout.” 
JOS.6.11	So he had the ark of 
JOS.6.12	The next day Joshua rose early in the morning. The 
JOS.6.13	and the seven 
JOS.6.14	So the second day they circled the city once and returned to the camp. So they did for six days.
JOS.6.15	Now on the seventh day they rose early, at dawn, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on that day did they march around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	Then on the seventh time, when the 
JOS.6.17	But the city will be under the ban of destruction—it and all that is in it belong to 
JOS.6.18	But you, just keep yourselves from the things under the ban. Otherwise you would make yourselves accursed by taking of the things under the ban, and so you would make the camp of Israel accursed and bring trouble on it. 
JOS.6.19	All the silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron are holy to 
JOS.6.20	So when the 
JOS.6.21	They utterly destroyed everything in the city—man and woman, young and old, ox, sheep and donkey—with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.6.22	Then Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land: “Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her relatives and all who belonged to her. All her relatives they brought out and put them outside the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	Then they burned the city with fire and all that was in it. Only the silver, the gold and the vessels of bronze and iron did they put into the treasury of the House of 
JOS.6.25	But Rahab the harlot, her father’s household and all who belonged to her, Joshua spared. She has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the scouts whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
JOS.6.26	At that time Joshua made an oath saying: “Cursed before 
JOS.6.27	So 
JOS.7.1	But 
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and spoke to them saying: “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	When they returned to Joshua, they reported to him: “Let not all the people go up—only about two or three thousand men need go up and strike Ai, so don’t wear out all the people there, for they are just a few.” 
JOS.7.4	So about 3,000 men from the people went up there, but they fled before the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai struck down about 36 of their men, and they chased them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim, striking them down on the slope. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water. 
JOS.7.6	Joshua then tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of 
JOS.7.7	“Alas, 
JOS.7.8	Oh my Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned its back before its enemies? 
JOS.7.9	For when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear of it, they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great Name?” 
JOS.7.10	Then 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned. Yes, they have also transgressed My covenant, which I commanded them. Now they have even taken of the things under the ban of destruction. So they have also stolen and even deceived, and even put them among their own possessions. 
JOS.7.12	So 
JOS.7.13	Arise! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says 
JOS.7.14	In the morning you will approach by your tribes. It will be that the tribe that 
JOS.7.15	Then whoever is taken with whatever is under the ban must be burned with fire, he and all belonging to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel forward by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. 
JOS.7.17	Then he brought forward the clans of Judah, and He took the family of the Zerahites. Then he brought forward the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. 
JOS.7.18	Then he brought forward his household man by man, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken. 
JOS.7.19	So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory now to 
JOS.7.20	Achan responded to Joshua and said: “It’s true! I have sinned against 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoil a beautiful Shinar mantle and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold 50 shekels in weight, I coveted them and took them. Look, they are buried in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it.” 
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and behold, it was buried in his tent with the silver underneath it. 
JOS.7.23	Then they took them from the middle of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep and his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	Then Joshua said, “Why have you brought trouble on us? 
JOS.7.26	They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day. Then 
JOS.8.1	Then 
JOS.8.2	Then you will do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king—except you will take its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.” 
JOS.8.3	So Joshua and all the people of war arose to go up to Ai. Joshua selected 30,000 men, valiant warriors, and sent them at night. 
JOS.8.4	He commanded them saying: “Look, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Don’t go too far from the city, but all of you be ready. 
JOS.8.5	Then I and all the troops with me will approach the city. Then it will be when they come out against us, like the first time, that we will flee before them. 
JOS.8.6	So they will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will think, ‘They are fleeing before us like the first time.’ While we are fleeing before them, 
JOS.8.7	you will rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city, for 
JOS.8.8	Now when you have seized the city, you will set the city on fire—according to the word of 
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them off, and they went to the ambush site, taking position between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people. 
JOS.8.10	Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people. He and the elders of Israel marched before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	All the people of war with him went up, advanced, and came in front of the city. They camped to the north of Ai, with a valley between him and Ai. 
JOS.8.12	But he had taken about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they stationed the people, the main army that was to the north of the city, and its rear guard to the west of the city. Then Joshua walked that night in the midst of the valley. 
JOS.8.14	So it came to pass when the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hurried and rose up early, and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place facing the Arabah. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. 
JOS.8.15	So Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	Then all the people who were in Ai were summoned to pursue them, so they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, so they left the city open as they chased after Israel. 
JOS.8.18	Then 
JOS.8.19	As soon as he stretched out his hand, the ambush arose quickly from their place, ran and entered the city and captured it; and immediately set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	Now the men of Ai looked back and saw, behold, the smoke of the city rising up to the sky! They had no place to flee this way or that, since the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city rose up, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	The others also came out of the city against them, so they were surrounded by Israel, some on this side and some on that side. They struck them down until not one survivor or fugitive was left. 
JOS.8.23	But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	After Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them were fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	All who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000—all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burnt Ai and made it a permanent heap of desolation to this day. 
JOS.8.29	Then he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. At sunset Joshua commanded that they take his carcass down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and piled over it a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. 
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar to 
JOS.8.31	as Moses the servant of 
JOS.8.32	 There on the stones he wrote a copy of the 
JOS.8.33	Then all Israel, with their elders and officials, and their judges, were standing on both sides of the ark facing the Levitical 
JOS.8.34	Then afterward he read all the words of the 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, including the women and the little ones and the outsiders walking among them.
JOS.9.1	Now when all the kings who were west of the Jordan, in the hill country, in the lowland and along the shore of the Great Sea to the vicinity of Lebanon—the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—heard about it, 
JOS.9.2	they gathered themselves together as a unified alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel. 
JOS.9.3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they acted craftily. They went and traveled as ambassadors, took worn-out sacks for their donkeys and worn-out wine skins, cracked and patched up, 
JOS.9.5	along with worn-out, patched up sandals on their feet and worn-out clothes on them. All the bread of their provision was dry and had become crumbly. 
JOS.9.6	Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country. So now, make a treaty-covenant with us.” 
JOS.9.7	Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites: “Perhaps you are living among us. How then should we make a covenant with you?” 
JOS.9.8	But they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?” 
JOS.9.9	So they replied to him: “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the Name of 
JOS.9.10	and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to King Sihon of Heshbon and to King Og of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	 So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us saying, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey, go to meet them and say to them: “We will be your subjects, so now make a treaty-covenant with us.’” 
JOS.9.12	This is our bread, which was hot when we took it for our provision from our homes on the day we left to come to you, but now behold, it is dry and crumbly. 
JOS.9.13	And these wineskins, which we were new when we filled them, but now see, they are cracked. Also these our garments and our sandals are worn-out because of the very long journey.” 
JOS.9.14	So the men of Israel took some of their provisions, and did not seek counsel from 
JOS.9.15	So Joshua made peace with them and cut a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the community swore to them. 
JOS.9.16	But it came about at the end of three days after they had cut a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and were living among them. 
JOS.9.17	So 
JOS.9.18	But 
JOS.9.19	but all the leaders answered the entire community, “We have sworn to them by 
JOS.9.20	This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	“Yes, let them live,” the leaders said further, “but let them chop wood and draw water for the entire community.” So the leaders decreed concerning them. 
JOS.9.22	Then Joshua summoned them and he spoke to them saying: “Why have you deceived us saying: ‘We are very far from you,’ when you are living among us? 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore, you are cursed, and you will never cease to be servants, wood-choppers and water-carriers for the House of my God.” 
JOS.9.24	So they answered Joshua and said: “It was because your servants were clearly told that 
JOS.9.25	Now behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your eyes to do to us, do.” 
JOS.9.26	Thus he did to them, delivering them from the hand of 
JOS.9.27	 On that day Joshua made them wood-choppers and water-carriers for the community, and for the altar of 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass that Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it—just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king—and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and remained among them. 
JOS.10.2	So he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a large city, as one of the royal cities—in fact, larger than Ai—and all its men were mighty. 
JOS.10.3	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon saying: 
JOS.10.4	“Come up and help me! Let’s attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and 
JOS.10.5	So the five kings of the Amorites—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon—gathered themselves and went up, they and all their armies, camped against Gibeon and attacked it. 
JOS.10.6	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in camp at Gilgal saying: “Don’t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, for all the kings of the Amorites living in the hill country have gathered against us.” 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor. 
JOS.10.8	 said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will stand before you.” 
JOS.10.9	So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.10	 threw them into confusion before Israel, defeated them with a crushing defeat at Gibeon, chased them by the road that goes up to Beth-horon, and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. 
JOS.10.11	While they were fleeing before Israel down the descent of Beth-horon, 
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke to 
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation took vengeance on its enemies. (Is it not written in the Book of Jashar?) Thus the sun halted in the middle of the sky, and did not hurry to go down for about a full day. 
JOS.10.14	There was no day like that before it or after it, when 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal. 
JOS.10.16	Now these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	So it was reported to Joshua, “The five kings are found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 
JOS.10.18	Joshua said, “Roll large stones onto the mouth of the cave, assign men over it to guard them, 
JOS.10.19	but don’t stay there yourselves. Chase after your enemies and attack them at the rear. Don’t let them enter their cities, for 
JOS.10.20	So it was that Joshua and 
JOS.10.21	Then all the people returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. No one dared sharpen his tongue against 
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.” 
JOS.10.23	So they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	When they brought out those kings to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come forward and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and put their feet on their necks. 
JOS.10.25	Then Joshua said to them, “Never fear or be dismayed. 
JOS.10.26	After this, Joshua struck them and put them to death, then hanged them on five trees, and they remained hanging on the trees until evening. 
JOS.10.27	It came about at sunset that Joshua commanded that they be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had hidden themselves. Then they placed large stones at the mouth of the cave which are there to this very day. 
JOS.10.28	On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword, putting it and every single soul in it under a ban of destruction, leaving no survivors. So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. 
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. 
JOS.10.31	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, camped against it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.32	 delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, so he captured it on the second day, and struck it and every single soul in it with the edge of the sword, just as he had done to Libnah. 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivors. 
JOS.10.34	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, camped against it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.35	They captured it on that day and struck it and every single soul in it with the edge of the sword, putting them under the ban that day, just as he had done to Lachish. 
JOS.10.36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it. 
JOS.10.37	They captured it and struck it, its king, all its towns, and every single soul that was in it with the edge of the sword, leaving no survivors, just as he had done to Eglon, putting it and every single soul in it under the ban. 
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it. 
JOS.10.39	He captured it and its king, and all its towns, struck them with the edge of the sword and put every single soul in it under the ban, leaving no survivors. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king. 
JOS.10.40	So Joshua conquered the entire country—the hill country, the Negev, the lowland and the slopes—with all their kings. He left no survivors, but he put everything that breathed under the ban, just as 
JOS.10.41	Thus Joshua defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, all the country of Goshen as far as Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	Thus Joshua captured all those kings and their lands at a single stroke, because 
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal. 
JOS.11.1	Now when Jabin king of Hazor heard about it, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings in the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland and in the regions of Dor to the west, 
JOS.11.3	the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites in the hill country and the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	So they came out, they and all their armies with them, a multitude with as many people as the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. 
JOS.11.5	All these kings joined forces, came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight with Israel. 
JOS.11.6	But 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all the people of war with him attacked them suddenly at the waters of Merom and fell upon them. 
JOS.11.8	Then 
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them as 
JOS.11.10	At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor had formerly been the head of all those kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	They struck down every single soul in it with the edge of the sword, putting them to the ban. There was none left that breathed after he burned Hazor with fire. 
JOS.11.12	Thus Joshua captured all the cities of those kings and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, putting them to the ban, just as Moses the servant of 
JOS.11.13	But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel did not burn any of them, except Hazor alone, which Joshua did burn. 
JOS.11.14	All the spoil of these cities and the cattle, 
JOS.11.15	Just as 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua captured all this land: the hill country, the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland, 
JOS.11.17	from the Mount Halak that ascends to Seir all the way to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, struck them down and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	For a long time Joshua made war with all those kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with 
JOS.11.20	For it was of 
JOS.11.21	At that time Joshua went and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from the entire hill country of Judah and from the entire hill country of Israel. Joshua put a ban on them with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	There was none of the Anakim left in the land of 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua captured the whole country, according to all that 
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land whom 
JOS.12.2	King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even up to the Jabbok River, the border of the children of Ammon; 
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah up to the Sea of Chinneroth eastward, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, eastward the way to Beth-jeshimoth, and on the south, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah. 
JOS.12.4	Also the territory of King Og of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
JOS.12.5	and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salcah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of King Sihon of Heshbon. 
JOS.12.6	Moses the servant of 
JOS.12.7	Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and 
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, on the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negev, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites): 
JOS.12.9	one king of Jericho, one king of Ai which was near Bethel, 
JOS.12.10	one king of Jerusalem, one king of Hebron, 
JOS.12.11	one king of Jarmuth, one king of Lachish, 
JOS.12.12	one king of Eglon, one king of Gezer, 
JOS.12.13	one king of Debir, one king of Geder, 
JOS.12.14	one king of Hormah, one king of Arad, 
JOS.12.15	one king of Libnah, one king of Adullam, 
JOS.12.16	one king of Makkedah, one king of Bethel, 
JOS.12.17	one king of Tappuah, one king of Hepher, 
JOS.12.18	one king of Aphek, one king of Sharon, 
JOS.12.19	one king of Madon, one king of Hazor, 
JOS.12.20	one king of Shimron-meron, one king of Achshaph, 
JOS.12.21	one king of Taanach, one king of Megiddo, 
JOS.12.22	one king of Kedesh, one king of Jokneam in Carmel, 
JOS.12.23	one king of Dor in the region of Dor, one king of Goiim in the Gilgal, 
JOS.12.24	one king of Tirzah, for a total of 31 kings.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old and advanced in years when 
JOS.13.2	This is the land still left: all the regions of the Philistines and all the Geshurites; 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor which is near Egypt to the territory of Ekron northward (counted as Canaanite); the five Philistine lords of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron; also the Avvim 
JOS.13.4	in the south, all the land of the Canaanites—from Mearah of the Sidonians to Aphek, as far as the border of the Amorites; 
JOS.13.5	the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath; 
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians. “I Myself will drive them out from before 
JOS.13.7	So now, divide this land as an inheritance for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	With the half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward, just as Moses the servant of 
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the flatland from Medeba to Dibon; 
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, up to the border of the children of Ammon; 
JOS.13.11	and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan up to Salcah; 
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he was left of the remnant of the Rephaim), for Moses defeated them and drove them out. 
JOS.13.13	Nevertheless, 
JOS.13.14	Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance—the fire offerings of 
JOS.13.15	 To the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their clans, Moses gave as 
JOS.13.16	their territory: from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland up to Medeba, 
JOS.13.17	Heshbon and all its towns on the tableland, Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathhaim, Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 
JOS.13.20	Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-Jeshimoth—
JOS.13.21	all the towns of the tableland and the entire kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. (Moses defeated him with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon who were living in the land, 
JOS.13.22	and Balaam son of Beor the diviner, whom 
JOS.13.23	As for the border of the children of Reuben, the Jordan was their border. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their clans, the towns and their villages. 
JOS.13.24	To the tribe of Gad, Moses gave the children of Gad according to their clans 
JOS.13.25	 as their territory: Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, half the land of the children of Ammon up to Aroer which is near Rabbah, 
JOS.13.26	from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Lidbir. 
JOS.13.27	In the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth and Zaphon—that is, the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon, with the Jordan as its border, to the lowest part of the Sea of Chinneroth beyond the Jordan eastward. 
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their clans, the towns and their villages. 
JOS.13.29	To the half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses also gave inheritance. For the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their clans, 
JOS.13.30	their territory was from Mahanaim all of Bashan, the entire kingdom of King Og of Bashan and all the tent-villages of Jair which are in Bashan—60 towns; 
JOS.13.31	also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir son of Manasseh, for half of the children of Machir according to their clans. 
JOS.13.32	These are the inheritances that Moses apportioned in the plains of Moab, across the Jordan to the east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance—
JOS.14.1	Now these are the portions that 
JOS.14.2	Their inheritance was by the lot, as 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe across the Jordan. But he gave no inheritance to the Levites among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the children of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except towns to live in, with their pasturelands around them for their livestock and for their cattle. 
JOS.14.5	As 
JOS.14.6	Then the children of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: “You know the word that 
JOS.14.7	I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of 
JOS.14.8	Nevertheless, my fellows that went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear, but I fully followed 
JOS.14.9	So Moses swore on that day saying: ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have fully followed 
JOS.14.10	So now behold, 
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me—as my strength was then, so is my strength now, for war and for going out and coming in. 
JOS.14.12	Now therefore, give me this hill country about which 
JOS.14.13	So Joshua blessed him, and he assigned Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his portion. 
JOS.14.14	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed 
JOS.14.15	Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba, for Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.
JOS.15.1	Now the allotment for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was as far as the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south. 
JOS.15.2	Their southern border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay projecting southward. 
JOS.15.3	Then it proceeded south of the Ascent of Akrabbim and passed on to Zin, and then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and passed on to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned toward Karka. 
JOS.15.4	It passed along to Azmon and went on to the Wadi of Egypt, where the border ended at the sea—this will be your southern border. 
JOS.15.5	The eastern border is the Salt Sea to the end of the Jordan. The border on the northern side was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan. 
JOS.15.6	It then went up to Beth-hoglah and passed north of Beth-arabah, and went up to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	The border then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal, facing the Ascent of Adummim, which is south of the wadi. Next the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 
JOS.15.8	Then the border went up the Valley of Ben-hinnom to the southern flank of the Jebusites—that is, Jerusalem—and went up to the top of the mountain that flanks the Hinnom Valley to the west, which is at the northern end of the Rephaim Valley. 
JOS.15.9	From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and went out to the towns of Mount Ephron, then curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). 
JOS.15.10	From Baalah the border turned westward to Mount Seir, passed along to the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon) and went down to Beth-shemesh, then passed Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	Next the border went out to the slope north of Ekron, then went out to Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah, went on to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea. 
JOS.15.12	The western border was the Great Sea and its coastline. These were the borders around the children of Judah according to their clans. 
JOS.15.13	Now to Caleb son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, at the command of 
JOS.15.14	So Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak—Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, children of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir (now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher). 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife to the one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it.” 
JOS.15.17	So Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s kinsman, captured it, so he gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 
JOS.15.18	Now it came about when she came to him, that she persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her: “What do you need?” 
JOS.15.19	“Give me a blessing,” she said. “For you have given me land in the Negev, you should also give me springs of water.” So he gave her the Upper Springs and the Lower Springs. 
JOS.15.20	This is the portion of the tribe of the children of Judah by their clans: 
JOS.15.21	the towns at the end of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the south were Kavzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,

JOS.15.42	Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Achzib and Mareshah—9 towns with their villages. 
JOS.15.45	Ekron with its towns and villages; 
JOS.15.46	from Ekron to the sea, all that were under Ashdod’s hand, with their villages, 
JOS.15.47	Ashdod, its dependencies and its villages; Gaza, its dependencies and its villages, all the way to the Wadi of Egypt and the coastline of the Great Sea. 
JOS.15.48	In the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	Goshen, Holon and Giloh—11 towns with their villages. 
JOS.15.52	Arab, Rumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	Janum, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior—9 towns with their villages. 
JOS.15.55	Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kayin, Gibeah and Timnah—10 towns with their villages; 
JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon—6 towns with their villages. 
JOS.15.60	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim) and Rabbah—2 towns with their villages. 
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	 Nibshan, the City of Salt and En-gedi—6 towns with their villages. 
JOS.15.63	As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out. So the Jebusites continue to live among the children of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.
JOS.16.1	The allotment for the children of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east to the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	From Bethel it went out to Luz, then continued to the border of the Archites at Ataroth. 
JOS.16.3	Then it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, to the territory of Lower Beth-horon, on to Gezer, and ended at the sea. 
JOS.16.4	So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their portion. 
JOS.16.5	Now the territory of the children of Ephraim according to their clans was as follows: the border of their inheritance eastward was Atroth-addar, up to Upper Beth-horon. 
JOS.16.6	Then the border went out westward at Mich-methath on the north, then the border turned eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it to the east of Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the border went along westward to the Wadi Kanah and ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their clans, 
JOS.16.9	together with the towns which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all these towns with their villages. 
JOS.16.10	But they did not drive out the Canaanites that were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and became forced laborers.
JOS.17.1	Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh, the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, since he was a man of war, he got Gilead and Bashan. 
JOS.17.2	So for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their clans—for the sons of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida—these were the male children of Manasseh son of Joseph according to their clans. 
JOS.17.3	But Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters—these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	So they appeared before Eleazar the 
JOS.17.5	Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan that is beyond the Jordan, 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of Manasseh received a portion among his sons. Meanwhile the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. 
JOS.17.7	The border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath, which is facing Shechem. Then the border went along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	Next the border went down to the Wadi Kanah, south of the wadi, by towns belonging to Ephraim among Manasseh’s towns. But the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the wadi, and ended at the sea. 
JOS.17.10	The south side belonged to Ephraim and the north side belonged to Manasseh, and the sea was its border. They reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east. 
JOS.17.11	Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh possessed Beth-shean and its villages, Ibleam and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages—three regions. 
JOS.17.12	Yet the children of Manasseh could not take possession of these towns, because the Canaanites were resolved to live in that land. 
JOS.17.13	But when 
JOS.17.14	Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua saying: “Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? For we are a numerous people whom 
JOS.17.15	So Joshua said to them, “If you have so many people, go you up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” 
JOS.17.16	“The hill country will not be enough for us,” the children of Joseph replied. “But all the Canaanites who inhabit the valley land have iron chariots—both those who are in Beth-shean and its villages and those who are in the Jezreel Valley.” 
JOS.17.17	But Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh saying: “You are a numerous people with great strength! You shouldn’t have just one allotment, 
JOS.17.18	because the hill country should be yours. Though it is a forest, you will clear it, and to its farthest borders it will be yours—for you will drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and even though they are strong.”
JOS.18.1	Then the whole congregation of 
JOS.18.2	Yet there remained among 
JOS.18.3	So Joshua said to 
JOS.18.4	Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe, and I will send them, and they will arise and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and then return to me. 
JOS.18.5	They are to divide it into seven portions: Judah will remain within its territory in the south, and the house of Joseph will remain within their territory in the north. 
JOS.18.6	After you have described the seven portions of land, bring the description here to me. Then I will cast lots for you here before 
JOS.18.7	But the Levites have no portion among you—for the priesthood of 
JOS.18.8	So the men arose and went, and Joshua charged those who went to write a description of the land, saying: “Go and walk through the land and describe it, then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here before 
JOS.18.9	So the men went, passing through the land, and described it in a scroll, town by town, in seven parts. Then they came to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before 
JOS.18.11	Now the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up, for their clans. The territory of their allotment lay between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
JOS.18.12	Now their border on the north side was from the Jordan—the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
JOS.18.13	Then the border passed from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward. Next the border went down to Atroth-addar, near the mountain that lies to the south of Lower Beth-horon. 
JOS.18.14	On the west side, from the hill facing Beth-horon southward, the border curved, turning about southward, and ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a town of the children of Judah. This was the west side. 
JOS.18.15	Then the south side was from the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim, then the border went westward, going to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	Then the border went down to the foot of the mountain by the Valley of Ben-hinnom, which is at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. Then it went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel. 
JOS.18.17	Then it curved north, and went to En-shemesh and ran to Geliloth opposite the Ascent of Adummim, and went down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	Next it passed northward to the slope facing the Arabah (of the Jordan Valley), and went down to the Arabah. 
JOS.18.19	Then the border passed along the side of Beth-hoglah northward, and the border ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border. 
JOS.18.20	The Jordan was to be the border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, and its borders all around according to their clans. 
JOS.18.21	Now the towns of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their clans were: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	Chephar-ammonah, Ophni, and Geba—12 towns with their villages. 
JOS.18.25	Gibeon, Ramah, Beerot, 
JOS.18.26	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zela, Eleph, and Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath—14 towns with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their clans.
JOS.19.1	Then the second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their clans. Now their portion was in the midst of the portion of the children of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	They had for their inheritance: Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	El-tolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 
JOS.19.6	Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen—13 towns with their villages; 
JOS.19.7	also Ain, Rimmon, Ether and Ashan—4 towns with their villages; 
JOS.19.8	all the villages that were around these towns as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their clans. 
JOS.19.9	The inheritance of the children of Simeon was taken out of the allotment of the children of Judah, for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them; so the children of Simeon had inheritance within Judah’s inheritance. 
JOS.19.10	Now the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their clans. The territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	Their border went up westward to Maralah, then reached Dabbesheth, and on to the wadi alongside Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth-tabor, then went on to Dobrath and up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	From there it went east to Gath-hepher, to Ethkazin, and went on to Rimmon, where it curved to Neah. 
JOS.19.14	Then the border circled around on the north to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtahel. 
JOS.19.15	Included also were Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah and Bethlehem—12 towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.16	This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their clans, these towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.17	The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their clans. 
JOS.19.18	Now their territory was to Jezreel, and included Chesulloth, Shunem, 
JOS.19.19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
JOS.19.20	 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
JOS.19.21	Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah and Beth-pazzez. 
JOS.19.22	The border extended to Tabor, Shahazim, and Beth-shemesh, and ended at the Jordan—16 towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.23	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their clans, the towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.24	Then the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their clans. 
JOS.19.25	Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	Allam-melech, Amad, and Mishal. It extended to Carmel westward and Shihor-libnath. 
JOS.19.27	Then it turned toward the sunrise to Beth-dagon, extended to Zebulun and to the Iphtahel Valley on the north toward Beth-emek and Neiel, then went on to Cabul on the north, 
JOS.19.28	then Ebron, Rehob, Hammon and Kanah, up to greater Sidon. 
JOS.19.29	Next the border turned to Ramah, then to the fortified city of Tyre. Then the border turned to Hosah and ended at the sea in the region of Achzib, 
JOS.19.30	Also included were Ummah, Aphek and Rehob—22 towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.31	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their clans, these towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.32	The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, for the children of Naphtali according to their clans. 
JOS.19.33	Their border went from Heleph and from Elon-beza-anannim, including Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.34	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went on from there to Hukok. It touched Zebulun on the south, touched Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan toward the east. 
JOS.19.35	The fortified cities were Ziddim-zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	Kedesh, Edrei, En-Hazor, 
JOS.19.38	Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh—19 towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.39	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their clans, the towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.40	The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their clans. 
JOS.19.41	The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
JOS.19.43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	and the Waters of Jarkon and Rakkon along the border opposite Joppa. 
JOS.19.47	The territory of the children of Dan slipped away from them, so the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem and captured it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, possessed it and settled in it, and called Leshem Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor. 
JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their clans, these towns with their villages. 
JOS.19.49	When they had finished allotting the land for inheritance by its borders, 
JOS.19.50	According to the command of 
JOS.19.51	These are the portions which Eleazar the 
JOS.20.1	Then 
JOS.20.2	“Speak to 
JOS.20.3	So the manslayer who kills any person by mistake and without premeditation may flee there. They will be your refuge from the avenger of blood. 
JOS.20.4	When one flees to one of those cities, he must stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. Then they are to take him into their city and give him a place to live among them. 
JOS.20.5	Now if the blood avenger pursues him, then they will not hand the manslayer over to him, since he killed his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand. 
JOS.20.6	So he will stay in that city until he can stand trial before the congregation, or until the death of the 
JOS.20.7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	Across the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the appointed cities for all 
JOS.21.1	Then the heads of ancestral houses of the Levites approached Eleazar the 
JOS.21.2	and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan saying: “
JOS.21.3	So 
JOS.21.4	the lot came out for the clan of the Kohathites. The children of Aaron the 
JOS.21.5	The rest of the children of Kohath received 10 towns by lot from the clans of the tribe of Ephraim, the tribe of Dan and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.21.6	The children of Gershon received 13 towns by lot from the clans of the tribe of Issachar, the tribe of Asher, the tribe of Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. 
JOS.21.7	The children of Merari according to their clans received 12 towns from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the tribe of Zebulun. 
JOS.21.8	So 
JOS.21.9	They gave from the tribe of the children of Judah and from the tribe of the children of Simeon these towns which are here mentioned by name. 
JOS.21.10	They were for the children of Aaron, of the clans of the Kohathites, of the children of Levi, for theirs was the first lot: 
JOS.21.11	So they gave them Kiriath-arba, the father of Anak (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pastures. 
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city and its villages they had already given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession. 
JOS.21.13	But to the children of Aaron the 
JOS.21.14	Jattir with its pastures, Eshtemoa with its pastures, 
JOS.21.15	Holon with its pastures, Debir with its pastures, 
JOS.21.16	Ain with its pastures, Juttah with its pastures and Beth-shemesh with its pastures—9 towns from these two tribes. 
JOS.21.17	Then from the tribe of Benjamin: Gibeon with its pastures, Geba with its pastures, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with its pastures and Almon with its pastures—4 towns. 
JOS.21.19	All the towns of the 
JOS.21.20	As for the other clans of the children of Kohath, the remaining Levites descended from the children of Kohath, the towns of their lot were from the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.21.21	So they gave them Shechem (the city of refuge for the manslayer) with its pastures in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer with its pastures, 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim with its pastures and Beth-horon with its pastures—4 towns. 
JOS.21.23	From the tribe of Dan: Elteke with its pastures, Gibbethon with its pastures, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon with its pastures and Gath-rimmon with its pastures—4 towns. 
JOS.21.25	From the half-tribe of Manasseh: Taanach with its pastures and Gath-rimmon with its pastures— 2 towns. 
JOS.21.26	All the towns of the clans of the rest of the children of Kohath were 10 with their pastures. 
JOS.21.27	Now to the children of Gershon of the clans of the Levites: from the half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan (the city of refuge for the manslayer) in Bashan with its pastures and Beeshterah with its pastures—2 towns. 
JOS.21.28	From the tribe of Issachar: Kishion with its pastures, Dobrath with its pastures, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with its pastures and En-gannim with its pastures—4 towns. 
JOS.21.30	From the tribe of Asher: Mishal with its pastures, Abdon with its pastures, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with its pastures, and Rehob with its pastures—4 towns.
JOS.21.32	From the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh (the city of refuge for the manslayer) in Galilee with its pastures, Hammoth-dor with its pastures, Kartan with its pastures—3 towns. 
JOS.21.33	All the towns of the Gershonites according to their clans were 13 towns with their pastures. 
JOS.21.34	To the remaining Levites of the clans of the children of Merari, they gave from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam with its pastures, Kartah with its pastures, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with its pastures, and Nahalal with its pastures—4 towns. 
JOS.21.36	From the tribe of Reuben: Bezer with its pastures, Jahaz with its pastures, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth with its pastures and Mephaath with its pastures—4 cities. 
JOS.21.38	From the tribe of Gad: Ramoth (the city of refuge for the manslayer) in Gilead with its pastures, Mahanaim with its pastures, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its pastures, and Jazer with its pastures—4 towns in all. 
JOS.21.40	All the towns that went by lot to the children of Merari (the remaining Levites) according to their clans, were 12 towns. 
JOS.21.41	The total of the towns of the Levites within the holdings of 
JOS.21.42	Each of these towns had its own pastures; so it was for all these towns. 
JOS.21.43	So 
JOS.21.44	Then 
JOS.21.45	Not one good thing that 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, Gadites and half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and said to them: “You have kept all that Moses the servant of 
JOS.22.3	You have not abandoned your kinsmen these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of 
JOS.22.4	So now 
JOS.22.5	Only be very careful to observe the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents. 
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave territory among their kinsmen to the west of the Jordan. Moreover, when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them 
JOS.22.8	and spoke to them saying: “Return to your tents with great wealth and with very much cattle, with silver, gold, bronze, iron and with very many clothes. Share the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.” 
JOS.22.9	So the children of Reuben, the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from 
JOS.22.10	Now when they came to the region near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan—a large, conspicuous altar. 
JOS.22.11	Then 
JOS.22.12	And when 
JOS.22.13	So 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten chieftains, one chieftain from each ancestral house of each of the tribes of Israel. Every one of them was the head of his ancestral house among the thousands of Israel. 
JOS.22.15	So they came to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, and spoke with them saying: 
JOS.22.16	“Thus says the whole congregation of 
JOS.22.17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although a plague came on the congregation of 
JOS.22.18	that you would turn away this day from following 
JOS.22.19	If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the possession of 
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan son of Zerah act unfaithfully concerning the things under the ban, and so wrath fell on the entire community of Israel? Nor did that man perish alone in his iniquity.’” 
JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben, the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel: 
JOS.22.22	“God of gods is 
JOS.22.23	If we have built an altar to turn away from following 
JOS.22.24	But we have done this rather out of anxious concern, for a reason, saying: ‘In the future, your children might say to our children: “What have you to do with 
JOS.22.25	For 
JOS.22.26	“Therefore we said: ‘Let’s now build an altar for ourselves—not for burnt offering or for sacrifice— 
JOS.22.27	but as a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, so that we may do the service of 
JOS.22.28	Therefore we said: ‘If they say such to us or to our future generations, then we will say, “See the replica of the altar of 
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against 
JOS.22.30	So when Phinehas the 
JOS.22.31	So Phinehas son of Eleazar the 
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the 
JOS.22.33	The report pleased 
JOS.22.34	So the children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar, “for it is a witness between us that 
JOS.23.1	Now it came about after many days, when 
JOS.23.2	that Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, their heads, their judges and their officials, and said to them: “I have grown old and am advanced in years. 
JOS.23.3	Now you have seen all that 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance, according to your tribes, these nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun. 
JOS.23.5	So 
JOS.23.6	“Be very resolute to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the 
JOS.23.7	and not intermingle with these nations who are still remaining among you. Do not mention the names of their gods or swear by them or worship them or bow down to them. 
JOS.23.8	But cling to 
JOS.23.9	For 
JOS.23.10	One of you can put a thousand to flight, for 
JOS.23.11	For your own sake, therefore, be most mindful to love 
JOS.23.12	For if you ever go back and cling to the remnant of these nations that are still remaining among you, and intermarry with them, and you associate with them and they with you, 
JOS.23.13	know for certain that 
JOS.23.14	“Now today I am about to go the way of all the earth. You will know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word of the good things which 
JOS.23.15	Now it will be that just as all the good things which 
JOS.23.16	When you transgress the covenant of 
JOS.24.1	Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned Israel’s elders, heads, judges and officials. So they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	Then Joshua said to all the people: “Thus says 
JOS.24.3	Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through the entire land of Canaan and multiplied his offspring. I gave him Isaac, 
JOS.24.4	then to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it as his own, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	“So I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst, and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	I brought your fathers out of Egypt. When you came to the sea, the Egyptians pursued your fathers to the Sea of Reeds with chariots and horsemen. 
JOS.24.7	But when they cried out to 
JOS.24.8	“Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites who were living beyond the Jordan. Though they fought against you, I gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land when I destroyed them from before you. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose and fought against Israel. He even sent and called for Balaam son of Beor to curse you. 
JOS.24.10	But I refused to listen to Balaam; instead, he had to keep blessing you. Thus I delivered you from his hand. 
JOS.24.11	“Then you crossed over the Jordan and came to Jericho, but the men of Jericho fought against you—the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—but I delivered them into your hand. 
JOS.24.12	Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove them out from before you—the two kings of the Amorites—not by your sword or your bow. 
JOS.24.13	I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities that you had not built and you have settled in them, vineyards and olive groves that you had not planted, that you are eating. 
JOS.24.14	“Now therefore, fear 
JOS.24.15	If it seems bad to you to worship 
JOS.24.16	Then the people answered and said: “Far be it from us that we should forsake 
JOS.24.17	For it was 
JOS.24.18	It was 
JOS.24.19	But Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to worship 
JOS.24.20	If you forsake 
JOS.24.21	But the people said to Joshua, “No! For we will worship 
JOS.24.22	So Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses to yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves 
JOS.24.23	“Now therefore, get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst, and incline your hearts to 
JOS.24.24	And the people said to Joshua, “We will worship none but 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua cut a covenant with the people that day, and set for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	Then Joshua wrote these words in the scroll of the 
JOS.24.27	Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone will be a witness to us. For it has heard all the words of 
JOS.24.28	Joshua then dismissed the people, each to his own inheritance. 
JOS.24.29	Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua son of Nun, the servant of 
JOS.24.30	So they buried him in the territory of his own portion in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
JOS.24.31	Israel worshipped 
JOS.24.32	Joseph’s bones, which 
JOS.24.33	Then Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they buried him in Gibeah, which had been given to Phinehas his son, in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Joshua that 
JDG.1.2	 said, “Judah will go up. Behold, I have given the land into his hand.” 
JDG.1.3	Judah then said to his brother Simeon, “Come up with me to my allotted territory, so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I also will go with you into your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	When Judah went up, 
JDG.1.5	They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, engaged him in battle, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	Though Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 
JDG.1.7	So Adoni-bezek said, “70 kings, having their thumbs and big toes cut off, used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.” They brought him to Jerusalem and he died there. 
JDG.1.8	Then the children of Judah attacked Jerusalem, captured it, struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill country, in the Negev and in the lowland. 
JDG.1.10	Judah then marched against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (the former name of Hebron was Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
JDG.1.11	From there Judah marched against the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir was Kiriath-sepher). 
JDG.1.12	Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give my daughter Achsah for a wife.” 
JDG.1.13	So Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger kinsman, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 
JDG.1.14	Now it came about when she came to him, she had persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you need?” 
JDG.1.15	Give me a blessing,” she said. “For you have given me land in the Negev; you should also give me springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the Upper Springs and the Lower Springs. 
JDG.1.16	The children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the children of Judah from the City of Palms to the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev of Arad. They went and settled with the people. 
JDG.1.17	Then Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath. They utterly destroyed it, and thus the name of the city was called Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	Also Judah captured Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory. 
JDG.1.19	 was with Judah, and he possessed the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots. 
JDG.1.20	Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised, so he drove out from there the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, so the Jebusites continued to live with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. 
JDG.1.22	Also the house of Joseph marched against Bethel, and 
JDG.1.23	The house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel (the former name of the city was Luz). 
JDG.1.24	Now the scouts saw a man coming out from the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city and we will deal kindly with you.” 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go free with all his family. 
JDG.1.26	So the man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and named it Luz, which is its name to this day. 
JDG.1.27	Manasseh, however, did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages. So the Canaanites resolved to dwell in that land. 
JDG.1.28	When Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out. 
JDG.1.29	Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites settled in Gezer among them. 
JDG.1.30	Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites settled among them, but became subject to forced labor. 
JDG.1.31	Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Zidon, Achlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik or Rehob; 
JDG.1.32	so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites who were dwelling in the land, because they did not drive them out. 
JDG.1.33	Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites dwelling in the land, though the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them. 
JDG.1.34	But the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not let them come down to the valley. 
JDG.1.35	Also the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim, but when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they became forced labor for them. 
JDG.1.36	So the territory of the Amorites ran from the Ascent of Akrabbim from the Rock and upward.
JDG.2.1	Now the angel of 
JDG.2.2	Now as for you, you must make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You must break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to My voice. What is this you have done? 
JDG.2.3	Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you, but they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’” 
JDG.2.4	Now when the angel of 
JDG.2.5	So they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to 
JDG.2.6	Now when Joshua had sent the people away, 
JDG.2.7	Then the people worshipped 
JDG.2.8	Then Joshua son of Nun, the servant of 
JDG.2.9	and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	But when all that generation were gathered to their fathers, there arose another generation after them that did not experience 
JDG.2.11	Then 
JDG.2.12	They abandoned 
JDG.2.13	So they forsook 
JDG.2.14	So the anger of 
JDG.2.15	Whenever they went out, the hand of 
JDG.2.16	Then 
JDG.2.17	Yet they listened not to their judges, for they prostituted themselves after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of 
JDG.2.18	Whenever 
JDG.2.19	But when the judge died, they would keep turning back and acted more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods, worshipping them, and bowing down to them. They abandoned none of their practices and stubborn ways. 
JDG.2.20	So the anger of 
JDG.2.21	I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, 
JDG.2.22	in order to test Israel by them, whether or not they will keep the way of 
JDG.2.23	So 
JDG.3.1	Now these are the nations that 
JDG.3.2	It was only in order that the generations of 
JDG.3.3	These nations included the five Philistine lords, and all the Canaanites, Zidonians and the Hivites living in the hill country of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	They were for testing Israel, to know whether they would obey the 
JDG.3.5	But 
JDG.3.6	and took their daughters for themselves as wives, gave their own daughters to their sons, and worshipped their gods. 
JDG.3.7	 did what was evil in 
JDG.3.8	So 
JDG.3.9	When 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of 
JDG.3.11	Then the land had peace 40 years. When Othniel son of Kenaz died, 
JDG.3.12	 again did what was evil in 
JDG.3.13	So he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, then went and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms. 
JDG.3.14	 became subject to King Eglon of Moab for 18 years. 
JDG.3.15	But when 
JDG.3.16	Ehud made himself a double-edged sword, a cubit in length, which he girded on his right thigh under his cloak. 
JDG.3.17	Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	Now when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried the tribute, 
JDG.3.19	but he himself turned back, at the idols that were near Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” “Keep silence!” he replied, so all his attendants left him. 
JDG.3.20	Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in a roof chamber where it was cool, and said, “I have a message from God for you,” so he arose from his throne. 
JDG.3.21	Then Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly. 
JDG.3.22	Even the handle went in after the blade and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not withdraw the sword out of his belly—and the filth came out. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out by the porch, shut the doors of the roof chamber on him, and locked them. 
JDG.3.24	After he had gone out, his courtiers came and looked, but behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked. So they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool chamber.” 
JDG.3.25	So they waited till they were embarrassed, but behold, he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber. So they took the key and opened them—and behold, their master was lying dead on the floor. 
JDG.3.26	But Ehud escaped while they were lingering, passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he arrived, he blew the 
JDG.3.28	He said to them, “Follow me, for 
JDG.3.29	Then they struck down at that time about 10,000 men of Moab—all stout men of valor—not a man escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had peace for 80 years. 
JDG.3.31	After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down 600 Philistine men with an ox-goad. So he also delivered Israel.
JDG.4.1	But 
JDG.4.2	So 
JDG.4.3	So 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a woman who was a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and 
JDG.4.6	Now she sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t 
JDG.4.7	Then at the Kishon torrent, I will draw out to you Sisera, commander of Jabin’s army with his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into your hand.’” 
JDG.4.8	But Barak said to her, “If you are going with me, then I will go. But if you aren’t going with me, I won’t go.” 
JDG.4.9	“Surely I will go with you,” she said. “However, no honor will be yours on the way that you are about to go—for 
JDG.4.10	Then Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and 10,000 men marched up after him, and Deborah went up with him. 
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh. 
JDG.4.12	They told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	So Sisera ordered all his chariots—900 iron chariots—and all the troops that were with him, from Harosheth-ha-goyim to the Kishon. 
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day in which 
JDG.4.15	 threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his army into confusion before Barak with the edge of the sword. Then Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-ha-goyim. The whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not one was left. 
JDG.4.17	Meanwhile Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Yael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	So Yael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me! Don’t be afraid!” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a blanket. 
JDG.4.19	He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and made him drink some, and covered him. 
JDG.4.20	Then he said to her, “Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you saying, ‘Is there a man here?’ then you will say, ‘There’s no one.’” 
JDG.4.21	Then Yael, Heber’s wife, took a tent pin and got a hammer in her hand, approached him stealthily and drove the pin into his temple until it pierced through into the ground—for he was exhausted and in a deep sleep. So he died. 
JDG.4.22	Now behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Yael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he entered with her, and behold, Sisera was lying dead, with a tent-pin in his temple! 
JDG.4.23	So on that day God subdued King Jabin of Canaan before 
JDG.4.24	The hand of 
JDG.5.1	Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day saying: 
JDG.5.2	“When leaders take the lead in Israel, when people freely offer themselves, bless 
JDG.5.3	Listen, O kings! Give ear, O rulers! I, to 
JDG.5.4	, when You came out from Seir, when You marched from Edom’s field, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water. 
JDG.5.5	The mountains quaked before 
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Yael, the highways were deserted, travelers walked by crooked paths. 
JDG.5.7	 Villages were deserted in Israel, deserted, until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel arose. 
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods— then war was in the gates. No shield or spear was seen among 40,000 in Israel! 
JDG.5.9	My heart is with Israel’s rulers, who offer themselves freely among the people. Bless 
JDG.5.10	Riders on white donkeys, sitting on saddle blankets, traveling on the road, sing! 
JDG.5.11	Louder than the sound of archers, at the watering places! There let them rehearse the righteous acts of 
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam! 
JDG.5.13	Then a remnant of nobles came down. 
JDG.5.14	Those with root in Amalek are from Ephraim, following you, Benjamin, with your peoples. From Machir came down rulers, and from Zebulun wielding the marshal’s staff. 
JDG.5.15	Issachar’s chiefs were with Deborah. Issachar was with Barak. Into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart. 
JDG.5.16	Why did you stay in the sheepfolds— to hear the piping for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there was much searching of heart. 
JDG.5.17	Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, and Dan, why did he stay by the ships? Asher sat at the seacoast, dwelling by its docks. 
JDG.5.18	Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to death, and Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield. 
JDG.5.19	The kings came, they fought, then the kings of Canaan fought, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no spoil of silver. 
JDG.5.20	From heaven, the stars fought, in their courses they fought Sisera. 
JDG.5.21	The Kishon torrent swept them away— that ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon! O my soul, march on with strength! 
JDG.5.22	Then the horses’ hooves beat from the dashing, the dashing of his mighty steeds. 
JDG.5.23	‘Curse Meroz!’ said the angel of 
JDG.5.24	Blessed above women is Yael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, above women in the tent is she blessed. 
JDG.5.25	 Water he asked, milk she gave him. In a lordly bowl she brought him butter. 
JDG.5.26	Her hand reached for the tent pin, her right hand to the workmen’s hammer, and with the hammer she struck Sisera, she smashed his head— yes, she crushed and pierced his temple. 
JDG.5.27	At her feet he collapsed, he fell, he lay. Between her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell dead. 
JDG.5.28	Through the window, Sisera’s mother looked out, through the lattice. and lamented shrilly: ‘Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?’ 
JDG.5.29	The wisest of her princesses answer her, yes, she repeats the words to herself: 
JDG.5.30	‘Are they not finding, dividing the spoil? A maiden, maidens for every warrior! To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments— a spoil of dyed garments of embroidery, double-dyed garments of embroidery for the necks of every spoiler!’ 
JDG.5.31	So let all Your enemies perish, 
JDG.6.1	Then 
JDG.6.2	Midian maintained an upper hand over Israel, and because of Midian 
JDG.6.3	Whenever Israel had done their sowing, the Midianites, Amalekites and people from the east would come up and raid them. 
JDG.6.4	They would set up camp by them, destroy the produce of the land as far as Gaza, and leave nothing in Israel to live on—not a sheep, ox or donkey. 
JDG.6.5	For they would come up with their cattle and their tents, invade like a multitude of locusts. Both they and their camels were innumerable, and they would come to the land to ruin it. 
JDG.6.6	So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and 
JDG.6.7	Now it came about when 
JDG.6.8	that 
JDG.6.9	Then I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all your oppressors, and drove them out from before you and gave you their land. 
JDG.6.10	Then I said to you, “I am 
JDG.6.11	Then the angel of 
JDG.6.12	Then the angel of 
JDG.6.13	But Gideon said to him, “O my lord, if 
JDG.6.14	Then 
JDG.6.15	Then he said to him, “Me, my Lord? With what would I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” 
JDG.6.16	But 
JDG.6.17	Then he said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your eyes, then please, show me a sign that it is really You talking with me. 
JDG.6.18	Please, don’t leave from here, until I come to You and bring out my offering and lay it before You.” So He said, “I will stay until you come back.” 
JDG.6.19	Then Gideon went in and prepared a kid and 
JDG.6.20	Then the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of 
JDG.6.22	When Gideon realized that He was the angel of 
JDG.6.23	But 
JDG.6.24	So Gideon built an altar there to 
JDG.6.25	Now it came to pass the same night that 
JDG.6.26	build an altar to 
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took ten of his male servants and did as 
JDG.6.28	Now when the townspeople arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, the Asherah pole that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered up on the altar that was built. 
JDG.6.29	So they said one to another, “Who did this thing?” And when they inquired and asked around, they said: “Gideon son of Joash did this thing.” 
JDG.6.30	Then the townspeople said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and even cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it.” 
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to all who stood against him, “So you’re going to defend Baal? You’re going to rescue him? Whoever defends him will be put to death in the morning! If he is a god, let him defend himself—since someone has broken down his altar.” 
JDG.6.32	So on that day he was called Jerubbaal saying, “Let Baal contend with him, since he broke down his altar.” 
JDG.6.33	Now all the Midianites, the Amalekites and the people of the east gathered together, crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	But the 
JDG.6.35	Then he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also rallied behind him.Then he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, and they came up to join them.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken, 
JDG.6.37	see, I am putting a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken.” 
JDG.6.38	And it was so. When he rose up early next day, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Let not Your anger burn against me if I speak once more. Let me please test once more with the fleece—let it now be dry only on the fleece, but let there be dew over all the ground.” 
JDG.6.40	God did so that night, since it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew over all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose up early and camped beside En-harod, while the camp of Midian was north of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley. 
JDG.7.2	But 
JDG.7.3	So now, make proclamation in the ears of the people saying, ‘Whoever is afraid or anxious may turn back and leave from Mount Gilead.’” So 22,000 people turned back, while ten thousand remained. 
JDG.7.4	But 
JDG.7.5	So he brought the troops down to the water, and 
JDG.7.6	Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	Then 
JDG.7.8	So the 300 took provisions and their 
JDG.7.9	It came to pass the same night that 
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to go down, first go down to the camp with your attendant Purah. 
JDG.7.11	Then you will hear what they are saying, and after that your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went down with his attendant Purah to an outpost of the army that was in camp. 
JDG.7.12	Now the Midianites, the Amalekites and all the people of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were countless, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
JDG.7.13	Yet when Gideon came, behold, there was a man relating a dream to his fellow, saying, “Listen, I just now had a dream: there was a loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into the camp of Midian, came up to a tent and struck it so it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.” 
JDG.7.14	His companion answered and said, “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel—God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand!” 
JDG.7.15	Now when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise! For 
JDG.7.16	Then he divided the 300 men into three columns, and he put into the hands of all of them 
JDG.7.17	Then he said to them, “Watch me and do likewise. So behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do just as I do. 
JDG.7.18	When I and all that are with me blow the 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came up to the outermost part of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch. Then they blew the 
JDG.7.20	When the three columns blew the 
JDG.7.21	Each one stood in his place around the camp, and then the entire army ran, shouting as they fled. 
JDG.7.22	Now when they blew the 300 
JDG.7.23	Then men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian. 
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim saying, “Come down against Midian and seize the waters down to Beth-barah, all along the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and took control of the waterside as far as Beth-barah by the Jordan. 
JDG.7.25	Then they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and they slew Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They kept pursuing Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan. 
JDG.8.1	Now the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?” So they criticized him sharply. 
JDG.8.2	But he said to them, “What have I now done compared to you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
JDG.8.3	God has given into your hand the princes of Midian—Oreb and Zeeb—so what was I able to do compared to you?” Their anger with him subsided after he said this. 
JDG.8.4	Then Gideon reached the Jordan and crossed over. He and the 300 men with him were exhausted, yet still pursuing. 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Succoth, “Please, give loaves of bread to the people on foot with me, for they are exhausted, and I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” 
JDG.8.6	But the officials of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand? So why we should give bread to your army?” 
JDG.8.7	Gideon replied, “Therefore when 
JDG.8.8	From there he went up to Penuel and spoke to them similarly, but the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered. 
JDG.8.9	So he spoke also to the men of Penuel saying, “When I come back safely, I will tear down this tower.” 
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and with them their armies of about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the east—the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen. 
JDG.8.11	Now Gideon went up by the road of the tent dwellers on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and ambushed the camp when it was off guard. 
JDG.8.12	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army. 
JDG.8.13	Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the Ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	He captured a boy from the people of Succoth and questioned him, so he wrote down for him the officials of Succoth and its elders—77 men. 
JDG.8.15	When he came to the men of Succoth, he said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna—about whom you mocked me saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’” 
JDG.8.16	Then he seized the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he punished the men of Succoth. 
JDG.8.17	He also tore down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city. 
JDG.8.18	Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” “As you are, so they were,” they answered. “Each one looked like the children of a king.” 
JDG.8.19	“They were my brothers, the sons of my mother,” he said. “As 
JDG.8.20	Then he said to Jeter his first-born, “Arise, kill them!” But the boy could not draw his sword, for he was afraid, since he was still a youth. 
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself and fall on us—for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks. 
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son, and your grandson as well. For you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.” 
JDG.8.23	But Gideon replied to them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. 
JDG.8.24	Yet Gideon said to them, “I would make a request of you, that you would give me every man an earring from his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
JDG.8.25	“We’ll certainly give them!” they replied. So they spread out a robe, and each one of them threw an earring from his spoil. 
JDG.8.26	So the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold—besides the crescent ornaments, the pendants and the purple robes that were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were on their camels’ necks. 
JDG.8.27	Gideon made it into an ephod, and put it in his town Ophrah. But all Israel prostituted themselves after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household. 
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued before 
JDG.8.29	Jerubbaal son of Joash went and lived in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	Now Gideon had 70 sons of his own issue, for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	Also his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son—he called his name Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	Then Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
JDG.8.33	But it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that 
JDG.8.34	So 
JDG.8.35	Nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, in accord with all the goodness which he had done for Israel.
JDG.9.1	Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke to them and the whole clan of his mother’s father’s household saying, 
JDG.9.2	“Speak now, in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem: Which is better for you, that 70 men—all the sons of Jerubbaal—rule over you, or that a single man rules over you? Remember also that I am your flesh and bone.” 
JDG.9.3	When his mother’s brothers discussed all these words of his in the ears of all Shechem’s leaders, their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” 
JDG.9.4	So they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith. Abimelech then hired idle and reckless fellows, who followed him. 
JDG.9.5	Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and slew his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, 70 men, on top of one stone. But Jotam, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself. 
JDG.9.6	Then all the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled themselves together and went and made Abimelech king at the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem. 
JDG.9.7	Now when they told Jotam, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, lifted up his voice, called out and said to them, “Listen to me, O lords of Shechem, that God may listen to you! 
JDG.9.8	Once the trees set out to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I stop yielding my oil, that honors God and man, and go wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.10	Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I stop yielding my sweetness and my delicious fruit, and go wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.12	So the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.13	But the vine said to them, ‘Should I stop yielding my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.14	Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you truly are going to anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shadow; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’ 
JDG.9.16	“So now, if you have acted in truth and integrity by making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt kindly with Jerubbaal and his household, and have done for him as he deserved—
JDG.9.17	for my father fought for you, and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian, 
JDG.9.18	but you have risen up against my father’s household today and have slain his sons—70 men on one stone—and have made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king over the lords of Shechem just because he is your brother—
JDG.9.19	if you then have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his household today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. 
JDG.9.20	But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the lords of Shechem and Beth-millo, and let fire come out from the lords of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech!” 
JDG.9.21	Then Jotam ran away and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of his brother Abimelech. 
JDG.9.22	After Abimelech had ruled over Israel for three years, 
JDG.9.23	God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem. So the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech—
JDG.9.24	in order that the violence done to Jerubbaal’s 70 sons might come due, so their blood might be laid on their brother Abimelech who slew them, and on the lords of Shechem who strengthened his hands to slay his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	So the lords of Shechem set up ambushers on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed anyone who passed by them along that road. So it was reported to Abimelech. 
JDG.9.26	Now Gaal son of Ebed had come with his relatives and moved to Shechem, and the lords of Shechem put their trust in him. 
JDG.9.27	When they went out into the field, they gathered grapes of their vineyards, trod them and had a party. Then they went into the house of their god, ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem—but why should we serve him? 
JDG.9.29	Now, if this people were under my hand, then I would get rid of Abimelech.” So he said to Abimelech, “Muster your army and come out!” 
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, his anger burned. 
JDG.9.31	So he sent messengers to Abimelech in deceit saying, “Watch out, Gaal son of Ebed and his relatives have moved to Shechem, and look, they are inciting the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	So now, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. 
JDG.9.33	So it will be in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you will rise early and advance on the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then you should do to them whatever your hand finds.” 
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose up by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four columns. 
JDG.9.35	Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and the people who were with him emerged from the ambush. 
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” But Zebul said to him, “You’re seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.” 
JDG.9.37	Then Gaal spoke up again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the middle of the land, and one column is coming by the road of the Diviner’s Oak.” 
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now? With it you said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have trashed? Now go out and fight him!” 
JDG.9.39	So Gaal went out ahead of the lords of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	But Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	While Abimelech stayed in Arumah, Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out so that they could not stay in Shechem. 
JDG.9.42	Now it came to pass the next day that the people went out into the field, and it was reported to Abimelech. 
JDG.9.43	So he took his people, divided them into three columns, and lay in ambush in the field. When he looked and saw the people were coming out of the city, he pounced on them and struck them down. 
JDG.9.44	Then Abimelech and the column that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and the other two columns rushed on all who were in the open field and struck them down. 
JDG.9.45	So Abimelech fought against the city all that day, captured the city and killed the people that were in it. Then he razed the city and sowed it with salt. 
JDG.9.46	Now when all the lords of Shechem’s Tower heard about it, they went into the vault of the temple of El-berith. 
JDG.9.47	When Abimelech was told that all the lords of Shechem’s Tower had gathered there, 
JDG.9.48	he and all the people with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Then Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees and lifted it up and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you’ve seen me do, hurry and do likewise.” 
JDG.9.49	So all the people likewise each cut down his branch and followed Abimelech. He laid them against the vault and set the vault on fire over them. So all the people of Shechem’s Tower also died—about a thousand men and women. 
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against Thebez and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the city leaders fled there and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor-bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman slew him.’” So his young man thrust him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	So when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place. 
JDG.9.56	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech—what he had done to his father by slaying his 70 brothers. 
JDG.9.57	Also all the wickedness of the men of Shechem God requited on their heads. Thus on them came the curse of Jotam son of Jerubbaal. 
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to deliver Israel. He dwelt in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	He judged Israel for 23 years, then died and was buried in Shamir. 
JDG.10.3	After him Jair the Gileadite arose, and judged Israel for 23 years. 
JDG.10.4	He had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys and had 30 towns in the land of Gilead, which are called Jair’s Villages to this day. 
JDG.10.5	Then Jair died and was buried in Kamon. 
JDG.10.6	Then 
JDG.10.7	So 
JDG.10.8	They shattered and crushed 
JDG.10.9	Then the children of Ammon also crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed. 
JDG.10.10	Then 
JDG.10.11	So 
JDG.10.12	the Zidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites who oppressed you? When you cried out to Me, I delivered you from their hand. 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have forsaken Me and worshipped other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.” 
JDG.10.15	Then 
JDG.10.16	Then they removed the foreign gods from among them, and worshipped 
JDG.10.17	Then the children of Ammon were summoned and camped in Gilead. 
JDG.10.18	The people of the princes of Gilead said one to another, “Whoever begins to fight against the children of Ammon will be chief over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was son of a prostitute, while Gilead was Jephthah’s father. 
JDG.11.2	But Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when the wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You won’t inherit in our father’s house, for you are a son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Some worthless fellows joined with Jephthah and went out with him. 
JDG.11.4	Now it came about after a while that the children of Ammon fought with Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, so we may fight the children of Ammon.” 
JDG.11.7	Jephthah then said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me out of my father’s house? So why are you coming to me now that you’re in trouble?” 
JDG.11.8	“Here is why we’re now turning to you,” the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah. “Come with us, fight the children of Ammon, and then you will become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 
JDG.11.9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back home to fight the children of Ammon, and 
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Let 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them, after Jephthah repeated all his terms before 
JDG.11.12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon saying, “What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to make war on my land?” 
JDG.11.13	The king of the children of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land, when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok as far as the Jordan. Now therefore, return them peaceably.” 
JDG.11.14	But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon, 
JDG.11.15	and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah, ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the children of Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	For upon departing from Egypt, Israel traveled through the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds and came to Kadesh, 
JDG.11.17	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom saying, “Please, let me pass through your land,” but the king of Edom would not consent. Similarly he sent word to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel, after staying at Kadesh, 
JDG.11.18	traveled through the wilderness, around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab and they camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. 
JDG.11.19	Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, “Please, let us pass through your land to my place.” 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his troops, camped in Jahaz and fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.21	But 
JDG.11.22	Thus they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	So now 
JDG.11.24	Don’t you possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? Likewise, whatever 
JDG.11.25	Besides, are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
JDG.11.26	While Israel was living in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities on both sides of the Arnon for 300 years, why didn’t you try to recover them all that time? 
JDG.11.27	So I myself have not transgressed against you, yet you are doing me harm by waging war against me. May 
JDG.11.28	However, the king of the children of Ammon paid no attention to the words of Jephthah that he sent him. 
JDG.11.29	Then the 
JDG.11.30	Then Jephthah vowed a vow to 
JDG.11.31	then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return safely from the children of Ammon, it will be 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah crossed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and 
JDG.11.33	So he utterly defeated them from Aroer until you come to Minnith—20 towns—and as far as Abel-cheramim. So the children of Ammon were subdued before 
JDG.11.34	Now when Jephthah arrived at his home in Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. Now she was his only child. Besides her he had no son or daughter. 
JDG.11.35	Upon seeing her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You made me bow down in grief—you’ve made me miserable! For I have opened my mouth to 
JDG.11.36	“My father, you have opened your mouth to 
JDG.11.37	She said further to her father, “Let this thing be done for me. Let me be alone two months, so that I may go on the mountains and mourn my virginity, I and my companions.” 
JDG.11.38	“Go!” he said. So he sent her away for two months. So she left, she and her companions, and mourned on the mountains because of her virginity.
JDG.11.39	Then at the end of two months she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow he had made—so she was never intimate with a man. So it became a custom in Israel, 
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel would go annually to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
JDG.12.1	Then the men of Ephraim were summoned and crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the children of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.” 
JDG.12.2	So Jephthah responded to them, “I and my people were in a bitter conflict with the children of Ammon, yet when I called you, you didn’t deliver me from their hand. 
JDG.12.3	So when I saw that you weren’t going to deliver, I put my life in my hand and crossed over against the children of Ammon, and 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are just fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. So when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	then they would say to him, “Say now, ‘Shibboleth,’” and he said “Sibboleth” since he could not pronounce it right, then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of Ephraim fell. 
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the towns of Gilead. 
JDG.12.8	After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	Now he had 30 sons, and 30 daughters—he sent them outside and brought in 30 girls from outside for his sons. He judged Israel seven years, 
JDG.12.10	then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. 
JDG.12.11	Then after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years, 
JDG.12.12	then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 
JDG.12.13	After him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	 again did what was evil in 
JDG.13.2	Now there was a certain man from Zorah, from a Danite clan, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren and bore no children. 
JDG.13.3	Then the angel of 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. 
JDG.13.5	For behold, you will conceive and bear a son. Let no razor come upon his head, for the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” 
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband saying, “A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome! But I did not ask him where he was from, nor did he tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	He said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and bear a son. So, drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child will be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.” 
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah entreated 
JDG.13.9	God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but her husband Manoah was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the man that came to me the other day has appeared to me!” 
JDG.13.11	So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked him, “Are you the one who spoke to the woman?” “I am,” he said. 
JDG.13.12	Then Manoah said, “Now may your words come about! What will be the child’s rule and his mission?” 
JDG.13.13	The angel of 
JDG.13.14	She should not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She must observe all that I commanded her.” 
JDG.13.15	Then Manoah said to the angel of 
JDG.13.16	But the angel of 
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah asked the angel of 
JDG.13.18	But the angel of 
JDG.13.19	Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering and offered them on the rock to 
JDG.13.20	For it came about when the flame went up from off the altar toward heaven that the angel of 
JDG.13.21	But the angel of 
JDG.13.22	Manoah said to his wife, “We will surely die, because we have seen God.” 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If 
JDG.13.24	Then the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. So the boy grew up and 
JDG.13.25	The 
JDG.14.1	Then Samson went down to Timnah and eyed in Timnah a woman, one of the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	So he came back and told his father and mother saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. So now get her for me as a wife.” 
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your kinsmen, or among all our people, that you are going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she is the right one in my eyes.” 
JDG.14.4	But his father and mother did not know that it was of 
JDG.14.5	While his father and mother went down to Timnah, Samson went to the vineyards of Timnah, and behold, a young lion came roaring at him. 
JDG.14.6	Then the 
JDG.14.7	So he went down and talked with the woman, and she looked right in Samson’s eyes. 
JDG.14.8	After a while he returned to get her, but turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion. 
JDG.14.9	So he scraped it into his hands and went on, eating as he went. Now when he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it, though he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion. 
JDG.14.10	Then his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a banquet there, for so the young men used to do. 
JDG.14.11	Now it came to pass, when they saw him, they brought 30 companions to be with him. 
JDG.14.12	Then Samson said to them, “Let me now propose a riddle to you. If you can indeed solve it for me during the seven days of the banquet, and figure it out, then I will give you 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes; 
JDG.14.13	but if you cannot solve it for me, then you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes.” “Propose your riddle,” they said to him. “Let’s hear it!” 
JDG.14.14	So he said to them, “Out of the eater came forth food, out of the strong came forth sweet.” But for three days they could not solve the riddle. 
JDG.14.15	Now on the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Coax your husband so that he will explain the riddle to us—or else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us?” 
JDG.14.16	So Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me! You don’t love me! You proposed a riddle to the sons of my people—yet you haven’t explained it to me!” “Look,” he said, “I haven’t explained it to my father or my mother, so should I explain it to you?” 
JDG.14.17	But she wept before him the seven days while their banquet lasted. So it was on the seventh day he told her, because she nagged him. Then she told the riddle to the sons of her people. 
JDG.14.18	So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” But he responded to them, “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, you wouldn’t have solved my riddle.” 
JDG.14.19	Then the 
JDG.14.20	But Samson’s wife was given to his companion who had been his best man.
JDG.15.1	But after a while, during the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. “I am going to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter. 
JDG.15.2	“I thought for sure you had utterly hated her,” her father said, “so I gave her to your best man. Her younger sister—isn’t she better than her? Please, let her be yours instead.” 
JDG.15.3	Then Samson said to them, “This time I am blameless from the Philistines when I do harm to them.” 
JDG.15.4	So Samson went and caught 300 foxes, and took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch between every two tails. 
JDG.15.5	Then he set fire to the torches and released them into the standing grain of the Philistines, Thus he burned up both the stacks and the standing grain, along with vineyards and olive trees. 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They were told, “Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his best man.” So the Philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	Then Samson said to them, “Since you have acted like this, surely I will take revenge on you—after that I will quit.” 
JDG.15.8	So he struck them leg upon thigh with a great slaughter. Then he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam. 
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah and spread out in Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah asked, “Why have you marched against us?” They replied, “We have come to arrest Samson—to do to him as he did to us.” 
JDG.15.11	Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines are ruling over us? So what is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.” 
JDG.15.12	“We have come down to bind you,” they said to him, “so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.” So Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you yourselves won’t kill me.” 
JDG.15.13	“No, we won’t kill you,” they said to him, “but we will bind you fast and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock. 
JDG.15.14	When he arrived at Lehi, the Philistines shouted upon meeting him. But the 
JDG.15.15	Then he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out and took it, and killed a thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, a heap … two heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I struck down a thousand men.” 
JDG.15.17	As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand. Then he named that place Ramat-lehi. 
JDG.15.18	Then he became very thirsty, so he called to 
JDG.15.19	But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he drank, he regained his strength and revived. Therefore he called it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. 
JDG.15.20	Then he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for 20 years.
JDG.16.1	Once Samson went to Gaza and eyed a prostitute there, so he went to her. 
JDG.16.2	The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here.” So they surrounded him, lay in ambush for him all night at the gate of the city, and kept quiet all night saying, “When morning light comes, then we kill him.” 
JDG.16.3	But Samson lay in bed till midnight, got up at midnight, grabbed the doors of the city gate along with the two gateposts and pulled them up bar and all. Then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is near Hebron. 
JDG.16.4	It came about afterward that he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	So the Philistine lords came up to her and said to her, “Coax him, see where his great strength comes from and by what we may overpower him, so we may bind him to subdue him—then we’ll each of us give you 1,100 pieces of silver.” 
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me please, where does your great strength come from? How could you be bound to subdue you?” 
JDG.16.7	Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have never been dried, then I would be weak and be like any other man.” 
JDG.16.8	So the Philistine lords brought up to her seven fresh cords that had never been dried, and she bound him with them, 
JDG.16.9	while an ambush was waiting in an inner room. “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” she said to him. But he broke the cords just as a strand of straw snaps when it touches fire. So his strength remained unknown. 
JDG.16.10	Delilah said to Samson, “Oh, you deceived me! You lied to me! Now tell me please, how you can be bound?” 
JDG.16.11	He told her, “If they only bind me with new ropes never used for work, then I will be weak and be like any other man.” 
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” Yet while the ambush was waiting in the inner room, he snapped them from his arms like a thread. 
JDG.16.13	So Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you’ve mocked me and told me lies! Tell me how you can be bound!” He told her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web of a loom.” 
JDG.16.14	So she pinned it with a pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin of the loom and the web. 
JDG.16.15	“How can you say, ‘I love you,’” she said to him, “when your heart is not with me? This is three times you’ve deceived me and not told me where your great strength comes from.” 
JDG.16.16	Now it came about when she nagged him daily with her speeches and kept bothering him, his soul was annoyed to death. 
JDG.16.17	So he divulged to her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever been upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will be weak and be like any other man.” 
JDG.16.18	Now when Delilah realized that he had confided to her all his heart, she sent and called for the Philistine lords saying, “Come up this time, for he has told me all his heart.” So the Philistine lords came up to her and brought the silver in their hand. 
JDG.16.19	Then she made him sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man and had the seven locks of his head shaved off. She even began to humiliate him while his strength departed from him. 
JDG.16.20	Then she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” When he awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I’ll go out as at other times, and shake myself off.” He did not comprehend that 
JDG.16.21	Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he became a grinder in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.
JDG.16.23	Now the Philistine lords gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, as they said, “Our god has given our enemy Samson into our hand.” 
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, as they said, “Our god has given into our hand our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us.” 
JDG.16.25	Now it came about when their hearts were merry that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may amuse us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he did make them laugh, when they made him stand between the pillars. 
JDG.16.26	Then Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the temple rests, so I may lean on them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the temple was full of men and women. All the Philistine lords were there and about 3,000 men and women on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them. 
JDG.16.28	Then Samson called out to 
JDG.16.29	Then Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the temple rested and leaned on them, one with his right hand and the other with his left. 
JDG.16.30	Then Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bent with all his might so that the temple fell on the lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed during his life. 
JDG.16.31	Then his kinsmen and all his father’s household came down, lifted him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. For he had judged Israel 20 years.
JDG.17.1	Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	And he said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, which you also repeated it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son of 
JDG.17.3	And he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, “I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to 
JDG.17.4	So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made it into a graven image and a molten image; and they were kept in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.5	Now the man Micah had a shrine of gods, and he made an ephod and household idols, and consecrated one of his sons to become his priest. 
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes. 
JDG.17.7	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem of Judah—of the clan of Judah—who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
JDG.17.8	Then the man departed from the town, from Bethlehem of Judah, to sojourn wherever he could find a place; and as he journeyed he arrived to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.9	And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he replied to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem of Judah, and I am travelling to stay wherever I may find a place.” 
JDG.17.10	So Micah said to him, “Stay with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, and a suit of apparel, and your provision.” So the Levite went in. 
JDG.17.11	And the Levite was content to stay with the man, and the young man became to him as one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of Dan was seeking an inheritance for itself to settle in, for to that day no territory had fallen to them for an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	So the children of Dan sent five men from their clan, out of their entire population, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it, and said to them, “Go, explore the land.” When they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite. So they turned aside there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?” 
JDG.18.4	He said to them, “Thus and thus Micah did for me—he hired me and I became his priest.” 
JDG.18.5	“Please inquire of God,” they said to him, “so we may know whether our way that we are going will be successful.” 
JDG.18.6	“Go in peace,” the priest said to them. “The way that you are going has 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men left and came to Laish, and saw the people there living securely, like the Zidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting. For there was no humiliation or anything oppressive in the land. Moreover, they were distant from the Zidonians and had no dealings with anybody. 
JDG.18.8	When they came back to their kinsmen at Zorah and Eshtaol, their kinsmen asked them, “What do you say?” 
JDG.18.9	“Arise, let’s go up against them!” they said. “For we have seen the land—see, it’s very good. Yet you’re sitting still! Don’t be sluggish! Go enter, possess the land! 
JDG.18.10	When you get there, you will come to unsuspecting people. The land is spacious. For God has put it in your hand—a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth.” 
JDG.18.11	So from the Danite clan from Zorah and Eshtaol, 600 men set out, armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-Dan to this day—behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. 
JDG.18.13	From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house. 
JDG.18.14	Then the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household idols, a carved image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you have to do.” 
JDG.18.15	So they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s house, and asked him about his welfare. 
JDG.18.16	Now the 600 men of the children of Dan, armed with their weapons of war, were standing by the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.18.17	The five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered there. They took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols and the molten image, while the priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.18	Now after these had gone into Micah’s house and taken the carved image, the ephod, the household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” 
JDG.18.19	“Be quiet!” they said to him. “Put your hand on your mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest! Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man or to be priest to a tribe and a clan in Israel?” 
JDG.18.20	So the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the household idols and the carved image, and went along among the people. 
JDG.18.21	So they turned and set off, and placed the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them. 
JDG.18.22	When they were at a good distance from Micah’s house, the men that were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered and caught up with the children of Dan. 
JDG.18.23	They called out to the children of Dan, who turned their faces around and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you have called them out?” 
JDG.18.24	“You have taken away my gods which I made,” he said, “and the priest, and walked away! What do I have left? And how then do you say to me, ‘What’s the matter with you?’” 
JDG.18.25	But the children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest bitter fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.” 
JDG.18.26	Then the children of Dan went on their way, and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house. 
JDG.18.27	Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and came to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting people, and struck them with the edge of the sword, and they burned the town with fire. 
JDG.18.28	There was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon and they had no alliance with anyone. It was in the valley near Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the town and lived in it. 
JDG.18.29	So they called the name of the town Dan, after the name of their father Dan born to Israel; however, the former name of the town was Laish. 
JDG.18.30	The children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. Jonathan son of Gershom son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the exile from the land. 
JDG.18.31	So they set them up Micah’s carved image that he had made, all the time that the House of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	Now in those days, there was no king in Israel. There was a certain Levite dwelling in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who got himself a concubine out of Bethlehem in Judah. 
JDG.19.2	But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months. 
JDG.19.3	Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her to bring her back. He had his servant and a pair of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house, and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him. 
JDG.19.4	His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, kept him staying with him three days, eating, drinking and lodging there. 
JDG.19.5	Now on the fourth day they woke up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart, but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you may go.” 
JDG.19.6	So the two of them sat down and ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please, be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.” 
JDG.19.7	Then the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him, so he lodged there again. 
JDG.19.8	Then he woke up early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please, strengthen yourself and tarry until afternoon!” So both of them ate. 
JDG.19.9	And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Behold now, the day is waning toward evening; please, spend the night. Behold, the day is drawing to a close; lodge here and let your heart be merry. Then tomorrow get up early for your journey so that you may go home.” 
JDG.19.10	But the man would not spend that night, so he rose up and departed and came to a place near Jebus—that is, Jerusalem—and with him were a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine. 
JDG.19.11	When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.” 
JDG.19.12	But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who are not of 
JDG.19.13	“Come on,” he said to his servant, “let’s try to reach one of these places—we’ll spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.” 
JDG.19.14	So they passed on and went their way, and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	 Then they turned aside there to enter and lodge in Gibeah. When he went in, he sat down in the town square, for there was no one who took them into his house to spend the night. 
JDG.19.16	Now behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was of the hill country of Ephraim but dwelled in Gibeah, while the rest of the men of the place were Benjamites. 
JDG.19.17	When he lifted up his eyes and saw the wayfaring man in the open square of the town, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?” 
JDG.19.18	“We are passing from Bethlehem of Judah,” he said to him, “to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, for I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem of Judah. But now I am going to the House of 
JDG.19.19	Nevertheless, there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your handmaid, and the young man that is with your servants—there is no lack of anything.” 
JDG.19.20	The old man said, “
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank. 
JDG.19.22	While they were making their hearts merry, behold, some worthless men of the town surrounded the house. Pounding the door, they shouted to the owner of the house, “Bring out the man that came into your house,” they said to the old man, “so we may have relations with him.” 
JDG.19.23	But the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my fellows, please don’t do this evil. After all, this man has come into my house. Don’t commit this disgraceful deed. 
JDG.19.24	Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine—I will bring them out to you now, and you may abuse them and do to them whatever pleases you, but don’t do such a degrading thing to this man!” 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them, and they raped her and abused her all the night until morning. When dawn broke, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	As the morning came, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man’s house where her master was, until it was full daylight. 
JDG.19.27	When her master rose up in the morning opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way, behold, the woman his concubine had collapsed at the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	“Get up!” he said to her, “and let’s go.” But there was no response. So he placed her on the donkey. Then the man got up and went to his place. 
JDG.19.29	Now when he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her to all the territory of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	So it was, that everyone who saw it said, ‘“Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen, since the day that 
JDG.20.1	Then all 
JDG.20.2	The chiefs of the people and of the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God—400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords. 
JDG.20.3	Now the children of Benjamin heard that 
JDG.20.4	So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, “I came with my concubine to Gibeah of Benjamin to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	Then men of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house over me at night. They intended to kill me, but instead, they raped my concubine until she died. 
JDG.20.6	So I took my concubine and cut her into pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s possession. For they have committed something obscene and degrading in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.” 
JDG.20.8	Then all the people arose as one man saying, “Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot. 
JDG.20.10	We will take ten men of a hundred throughout the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to supply provisions for the troops, so that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may do to them according to all the disgrace that they have committed in Israel.” 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the town, knit together as one man. 
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through the tribe of Benjamin saying, “What is this wickedness that has taken place among you? 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore, give up the men, the worthless fellows that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge this evil from Israel.” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their kinsmen 
JDG.20.14	So the children of Benjamin were gathered from their towns to Gibeah, to go out to battle against 
JDG.20.15	On that day the children of Benjamin mustered 26,000 swordsmen from the towns, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered 700 chosen men. 
JDG.20.16	Out of all these troops there were 700 chosen men that were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. 
JDG.20.17	Meanwhile the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, numbered 400,000 swordsmen; all men of war. 
JDG.20.18	Then 
JDG.20.19	So 
JDG.20.20	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and arrayed for battle against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	But the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and struck down 22,000 men of Israel on the field that day. 
JDG.20.22	But the people of the men of Israel rallied their strength and arrayed for battle again in the same place where they had arrayed themselves the first day. 
JDG.20.23	Yet 
JDG.20.24	So 
JDG.20.25	Benjamin came out against them from Gibeah again the second day and struck down 18,000 of 
JDG.20.26	Then all 
JDG.20.27	Then 
JDG.20.28	and Pinchas son of Eleazar son of Aaron had ministered before it in those days) saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or should I cease?” 
JDG.20.29	So Israel set men in ambush against Gibeah on all sides. 
JDG.20.30	Then 
JDG.20.31	The children of Benjamin came out against the people, but they were drawn away from the town, and they began to strike and kill some of the people (about 30 men of Israel), as at other times, on the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. 
JDG.20.32	So the children of Benjamin said, “They are defeated before us as before.” But 
JDG.20.33	Then all the troops of Israel rose up from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the troops of Israel in ambush burst out of their place west of Geba. 
JDG.20.34	Then 10,000 troops chosen from all Israel made a frontal attack on Gibeah, and the battle became fierce; but the Benjamites did not know not that disaster was about to strike them. 
JDG.20.35	Then 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Benjamin realized that they were defeated. Now the men of Israel had yielded ground to Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush that they had laid against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	So the men in ambush rushed suddenly upon Gibeah, then the men in another ambush advanced and struck the whole town with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now there was a prearranged sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush—they would make a great beacon of smoke rise up from the town—
JDG.20.39	then the men of Israel would return to the battle. When Benjamin began to strike, killing about 30 of the men of Israel, they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.” 
JDG.20.40	But when the beacon began to arise up from the town in a pillar of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them, and behold, the whole town was going up in smoke to the sky. 
JDG.20.41	Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they realized that disaster had struck them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the way of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. Meanwhile those who came from the towns massacred them in their midst. 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overtook them, near Gibeah toward the east. 
JDG.20.44	Thus 18,000 men of Benjamin fell, all them were men of valor. 
JDG.20.45	Then the rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they picked off 5,000 of them on the highways. They pressed hard after them to Gidom, and struck down 2,000 more of them. 
JDG.20.46	So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men drawing the sword—all of them were men of valor. 
JDG.20.47	But 600 men turned and escaped into the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed at the rock of Rimmon four months. 
JDG.20.48	The men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword—the entire city, the cattle and all that they found. They also set on fire all the towns that they found. 
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage.” 
JDG.21.2	So the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. 
JDG.21.3	They said, “
JDG.21.4	Then it was on the next day that the people rose up early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. 
JDG.21.5	Then 
JDG.21.6	Now 
JDG.21.7	What should we do about providing wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by 
JDG.21.8	Then they inquired, “Which one of the tribes of Israel that did not go up to 
JDG.21.9	For when the people were numbered, behold not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. 
JDG.21.10	So the congregation sent 12,000 valiant warriors there, and commanded them saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 
JDG.21.11	Now this is the thing that you will do: you are to utterly destroy every male and every woman who has lain with a man.” 
JDG.21.12	So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known man by lying with him. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. 
JDG.21.13	Then the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed 
JDG.21.14	When Benjamin returned at that time, they gave them the women whom they had spared from the women of Jabesh-gilead. Yet they were not enough for them. 
JDG.21.15	So the people were sorry for Benjamin because 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who are left, since the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?” 
JDG.21.17	They said “The survivors of Benjamin must have heirs, so that a tribe would not be blotted out from Israel. 
JDG.21.18	Yet we cannot give them wives of our daughters,” for 
JDG.21.19	So they said, “Behold, there is the feast of 
JDG.21.20	So they commanded the children of Benjamin saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	and watch, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh should come out to join in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and let each of you catch his wife from among the daughters of Shiloh. Then go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	So it will be, if their fathers or brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously for us, because we did not provide each one of them his wife in battle—nor did you give the girls to them, else you would now be guilty.’” 
JDG.21.23	So the children of Benjamin did so, and took the number of wives from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. 
JDG.21.24	So 
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim—his name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
1SA.1.2	He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless. 
1SA.1.3	Now this man used to go up from his town every year to worship and to sacrifice to 
1SA.1.4	Then on the designated day Elkanah would sacrifice and give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters, 
1SA.1.5	but to Hannah he would give only one portion—even though he loved Hannah—for 
1SA.1.6	Her rival would taunt her bitterly to provoke her, because 
1SA.1.7	So it was year after year, whenever she went up to the House of 
1SA.1.8	Then her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 
1SA.1.9	After eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah got up. Now Eli the 
1SA.1.10	While her soul was bitter, she prayed to 
1SA.1.11	So she made a vow and said, “
1SA.1.12	It came to pass, as she prayed long before 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah was praying in her heart—only her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk. 
1SA.1.14	Then Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!” 
1SA.1.15	But in response Hannah said, “No, my lord, I am a woman with an oppressed spirit! I haven’t been drinking wine or beer. Instead I’ve been pouring out my soul before 
1SA.1.16	Don’t consider your handmaid a wicked woman. For out of my great anguish and grief I’ve been praying until now.” 
1SA.1.17	Then Eli responded, “Go in 
1SA.1.18	“May your maidservant find favor in your eyes,” she said. So the woman went her way; she ate, and her countenance was no longer dejected. 
1SA.1.19	They rose up early in the morning and worshipped before 
1SA.1.20	So it came to pass at the turn of the year that Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, “because I have asked 
1SA.1.21	When the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer the annual sacrifice to 
1SA.1.22	Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned, I will bring him, so he may appear before 
1SA.1.23	So her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Stay until you have weaned him—only may 
1SA.1.24	When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour and a jar of wine, and brought him to the House of 
1SA.1.25	After they slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	“It’s me, my lord!” she said. “As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying to 
1SA.1.27	For this boy I prayed, and 
1SA.1.28	So I in turn dedicate him to 
1SA.2.1	Then Hannah prayed and said, “My heart exults in 
1SA.2.2	There is none holy as 
1SA.2.3	Boast no more so proudly— insolence comes out of your mouth. For 
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty are broken, but the stumbling are girded with strength. 
1SA.2.5	Those full hire themselves for bread, but those starving hunger no more. Even the barren gives birth to seven, but she with many sons languishes. 
1SA.2.6	 causes death and makes alive, He brings down to 
1SA.2.7	 makes poor and makes rich, He brings low and also lifts up. 
1SA.2.8	He raises the helpless from the dust. He lifts the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with nobles, granting them a seat of honor. For the earth’s pillars are 
1SA.2.9	He guards the steps of His godly ones, but the wicked are silenced in darkness. For one does not prevail by might. 
1SA.2.10	Those who oppose 
1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, while the boy served 
1SA.2.12	Now Eli’s sons were worthless men; they did not acknowledge 
1SA.2.13	Now this was the custom of the 
1SA.2.14	and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the 
1SA.2.15	Even before they burned the fat, the 
1SA.2.16	If the man said to him, “Let them first burn the fat up as smoke, and then take as much as you desire,” he would reply, “No! But you must give it now—otherwise, I will take it by force.” 
1SA.2.17	Thus the sin of the young men was very great before 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel was ministering before 
1SA.2.19	Moreover, his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
1SA.2.20	Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May 
1SA.2.21	So 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli had grown very old. He heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how they slept with the women who served at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 
1SA.2.23	So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear evil reports from all these people concerning you. 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons! For this is not a good report that I hear 
1SA.2.25	If a man sins against another, God may pardon him; but if a man sins against 
1SA.2.26	Meanwhile, the child Samuel kept growing and increasing in favor both with 
1SA.2.27	Now there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “Thus says 
1SA.2.28	Also did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My 
1SA.2.29	Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me, by fattening yourselves with the choicest of every offering of Israel My people? 
1SA.2.30	Therefore 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days are coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no one in your household will reach old age. 
1SA.2.32	Moreover, you will behold the distress of My dwelling, despite all that is good that has been done to Israel. So no one in your household will reach old age, forever. 
1SA.2.33	Any man of yours that I did not cut off from My altar would make your eyes weep and your soul grieve. So all the increase of your household will die as young men. 
1SA.2.34	Now this will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons—Hophni and Phinehas—on the same day both of them will die. 
1SA.2.35	“Yet I will raise up for Myself a faithful 
1SA.2.36	Anyone left in your household will come and bow low to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say: ‘Please, assign me to one of the priestly offices so that I may eat a morsel of bread.’”
1SA.3.1	Now the boy Samuel was in the service of 
1SA.3.2	One day, Eli was lying down in his place—now his eyes had grown dim so that he could not see, 
1SA.3.3	and the lamp of God had not yet gone out. Samuel was lying down in 
1SA.3.4	Then 
1SA.3.5	Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he replied, “I didn’t call—go back to sleep.” So he went back and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	Then 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel had not experienced 
1SA.3.8	 called Samuel again for the third time. So he got up and went to Eli, and said “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that 
1SA.3.9	So Eli said to Samuel, “Go back to sleep, and if He calls you, say: ‘Speak, 
1SA.3.10	Then 
1SA.3.11	Then 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity that he knew about, because his sons brought a curse on themselves yet he did not rebuke them. 
1SA.3.14	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.” 
1SA.3.15	Then Samuel lay down until the morning, when he opened the doors of the House of 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” “Here I am,” he replied. 
1SA.3.17	“What is the word that He has spoken to you?” he said. “Please don’t hide it from me. May God do so to you and even more if you hide anything at all from me that He spoke to you.” 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing. Then Eli said, “He is 
1SA.3.19	So Samuel grew up and 
1SA.3.20	Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was entrusted as a prophet of 
1SA.3.21	 started to appear once more in Shiloh, for 
1SA.4.1	So it was that the word of Samuel went forth to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines in battle. They camped at Eben-ezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel, and when the battle was fought, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed 4,000 men on the battlefield. 
1SA.4.3	When the people came back to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of 
1SA.4.5	Now when the ark of the covenant of 
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they wondered, “What’s this noise of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” When they realized that the ark of 
1SA.4.7	the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” So they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has ever happened before. 
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of this mighty God? This is the God that struck down the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Be strong, and conduct yourselves like men, O Philistines, or else you will become enslaved to the Hebrews as they have been to you. Be like men and fight!” 
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines did fight and Israel was defeated—they fled every man to his tent. The slaughter was very great, as 30,000 of Israel’s foot soldiers fell. 
1SA.4.11	Moreover, the ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons Hophni and Phinehas died. 
1SA.4.12	Now that same day a man of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 
1SA.4.13	When he arrived, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the wayside watching, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man arrived to announce it in the town, the entire town cried out. 
1SA.4.14	And when Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he asked, “What’s this noisy commotion?” So the man rushed and came and told Eli. 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was 98 years old, and his eyes were fixed in a blind stare. 
1SA.4.16	Then the man said to Eli, “I am one coming from the battlefield—I escaped from the battlefield today.” “What is happening, my son?” he asked. 
1SA.4.17	And the messenger answered and said, “Israel fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons died—Hophni and Phinehas—and the ark of God was captured.” 
1SA.4.18	As soon as he mentioned of the ark of God, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the town gate. His neck broke and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel 40 years. 
1SA.4.19	Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child and about to deliver. When she heard the report that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she crouched down and gave birth because she was seized with her labor pains. 
1SA.4.20	As she was dying, the women attending her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have brought forth a son!” But she did not respond or take it to heart. 
1SA.4.21	Then she named the child Ichabod saying, “The glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. 
1SA.4.22	So she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken!”
1SA.5.1	Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God and they brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon, and placed it beside Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	But when the Ashdodites arose early next morning, to everyone’s surprise, Dagon had fallen to his face on the ground before the ark of 
1SA.5.4	But when they arose early the following morning, surprisingly, Dagon had fallen to his face on the ground before the ark of 
1SA.5.5	That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any who enter Dagon’s house will tread on Dagon’s threshold in Ashdod. 
1SA.5.6	Then the hand of 
1SA.5.7	When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay with us, for His hand has dealt harshly against us as well as against our god Dagon.” 
1SA.5.8	So they sent word and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and asked, “What will we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They replied, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” So they carried the ark of the God of Israel over. 
1SA.5.9	But it came about, that after they had carried it around, that the hand of 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But it came about as the ark of God came to Ekron that the Ekronites cried out saying, “They’ve brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us to kill us and our people!” 
1SA.5.11	So they sent word and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away—let it go back to its own place, so it won’t kill us and our people!” For a panic of death was throughout the entire city, as God’s hand was very heavy there. 
1SA.5.12	The people who did not die were afflicted with tumors, so that the outcry of the city went up to heaven. 
1SA.6.1	After the ark of 
1SA.6.2	the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners saying, “What should we do with the ark of 
1SA.6.3	So they said, “If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel back, do not send it empty. For you must surely return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be revealed to you why His hand has not been removed from you.” 
1SA.6.4	“What guilt offering should we return to Him?” they asked. So they said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice—according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on each of you and on your lords. 
1SA.6.5	So you will make images of your tumors and images of your mice that mar the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand off of you, your gods and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He afflicted them, didn’t they send them away so they left? 
1SA.6.7	Now therefore get a new cart ready, two milk cows on which there has never been a yoke, hitch the cows to the cart, and return their calves home, away from them. 
1SA.6.8	Then take the ark of 
1SA.6.9	Then watch—if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then it was He who inflicted on us this great harm. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it just happened to us by chance.” 
1SA.6.10	So the people did so—they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	Then they placed the ark of 
1SA.6.12	So the cows took the way straight toward Beth-shemesh—they kept along the same highway, lowing as they went, and turned aside neither to the right nor to the left. The lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh. 
1SA.6.13	Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. When they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it. 
1SA.6.14	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there, where there was a large stone. Then they chopped the wood of the cart and offered up the cows as a burnt ­offering to 
1SA.6.15	The Levites took down the ark of 
1SA.6.16	Now when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron that same day. 
1SA.6.17	So these are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to 
1SA.6.18	The golden mice also corresponded to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords—both the fortified cities and their country villages—as far as the large stone on which they had set down the ark of 
1SA.6.19	Then He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had gazed into the ark of 
1SA.6.20	So the men of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before 
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of 
1SA.7.1	Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came and fetched up the ark of 
1SA.7.2	From the day the ark rested in Kiriath-jearim it was a long time, 20 years, and the whole house of Israel yearned after 
1SA.7.3	Then Samuel spoke to the whole house of Israel saying, “If you are returning to 
1SA.7.4	So 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to 
1SA.7.6	So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water and poured it out before 
1SA.7.7	Now when the Philistines heard that 
1SA.7.8	So 
1SA.7.9	Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to 
1SA.7.10	As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But 
1SA.7.11	Then the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down all the way to below Beth-car. 
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named Eben-ezer saying, “Thus far 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and they did not invade the border of Israel anymore. The hand of 
1SA.7.14	The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel, from Ekron to Gath, were restored to Israel, and Israel recovered its territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
1SA.7.15	Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	He used to go annually on a circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, and would judge over Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	Then his return was to Ramah, because his home was there, and from there he would judge Israel. So he built an altar to 
1SA.8.1	Now when Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second Abijah—they were judges in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain—they took bribes and perverted justice. 
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, 
1SA.8.5	and said to him, “Behold, you have grown old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us—like all the nations.” 
1SA.8.6	But the matter was displeasing in Samuel’s eyes when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to 
1SA.8.7	Then 
1SA.8.8	Like all the deeds that they have done since the day I brought them out of Egypt to this day—forsaking Me and worshiping other gods—so they are doing to you also. 
1SA.8.9	So now, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly forewarn them, and declare to them the rulings of the king who will reign over them.” 
1SA.8.10	Now Samuel reported all the words of 
1SA.8.11	“This will be the practice of the king that will reign over you,” he said. “He will draft your sons and assign them as his charioteers and horsemen, and they will run before his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	He will appoint them as commanders of thousands and captains of fifties, also some to plow his fields, reap his harvest, make his weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	Also he will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will seize the best of your fields, vineyards and olive groves, and give them to his courtiers. 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage and give it to his officials and slaves. 
1SA.8.16	He will also take your male and female servants, your best young men and your donkeys and make them do his work. 
1SA.8.17	He will also take the tenth of your flocks. Then you yourselves will become his slaves. 
1SA.8.18	When the day comes and you cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, 
1SA.8.19	But the people refused to listen to Samuel, and they said, “No! But a king should be over us! 
1SA.8.20	So we may become like all the nations—having our king who will judge us, go out before us and fight our battles.” 
1SA.8.21	After Samuel heard all the words of the people, he reported them back in the hearing of 
1SA.8.22	 said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and appoint a king to reign for them.” So Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Go, each one to his town.”
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish son of Abiel son of Zeror son of Becorath son of Aphiah son of a Benjamite. He was a mighty man of valor 
1SA.9.2	and he had a son whose name was Saul—young and handsome—there was no one among 
1SA.9.3	Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Take now one of the servants with you, get up and look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of Benjamin, but still did not find them. 
1SA.9.5	When they arrived in the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant with him, “Come, let’s go back—otherwise my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.” 
1SA.9.6	Then his servant said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this town, and he is a man held in honor—everything he says is sure to come true. Now, let’s go there. Perhaps he’ll tell us the way we should go.” 
1SA.9.7	Then said Saul to his servant, “But look, if we go, what would we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is nothing to bring to the man of God as a present. What do we have?” 
1SA.9.8	The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us our way.” 
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, “Come, let’s go to the seer”—for today’s prophet was formerly called a seer.) 
1SA.9.10	Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said. Come, let’s go!” So they went to the town where the man of God was. 
1SA.9.11	As they went up the hill to the town, they found some girls going out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?” 
1SA.9.12	They answered them and said, “He is there, ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come today to the town because people have a sacrifice at the high place today. 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the town, you’ll find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must first bless the sacrifice—afterward the guests can eat. So now, get up, for you will find him at once.” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up to the town. As they were entering the town, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place. 
1SA.9.15	One day before Saul came, 
1SA.9.16	“Tomorrow about this time, I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you will anoint him ruler over My people Israel. He will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines. I have observed My people, because their cry has come to Me.” 
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul approached Samuel inside the gate and asked, “Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is?” 
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul by saying, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place. For today you will eat with me. In the morning when I send you off, I will tell you everything that is in your heart. 
1SA.9.20	As for the donkeys that you lost three days ago, don’t set your heart on them, for they have been found. Now, for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s household?” 
1SA.9.21	Saul answered by saying, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my clan is the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? So why do you say such things to me?” 
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of the guests, who numbered about 30 people. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave you and told you to set aside.” 
1SA.9.24	So the cook took up the thigh, raised it, and set it before Saul. Then he said, “Here is what has been reserved! Set it before you and eat, because it has been kept until this appointed time for you, since I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
1SA.9.25	When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof. 
1SA.9.26	They rose early, and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof saying, “Get up, so I may send you off.” So Saul got up, and both of them, he and Samuel, went outside. 
1SA.9.27	As they were going down toward the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell your servant to go ahead of us and pass on, but as for you, stand still awhile, so that I may proclaim to you the word of God.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it on his head. Then he kissed him and said, “Has 
1SA.10.2	When you leave me today, you will find two men near the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you: ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found—behold, your father has dropped the matter about the donkeys and is worried about you saying, “What should I do about my son?’” 
1SA.10.3	Then you will go on from there until you reach the terebinth of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Beth-el will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and the other carrying a jug of wine. 
1SA.10.4	Then they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will receive from their hand. 
1SA.10.5	After that, you will arrive at the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is. It will come about, as soon as you enter the town, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by a harp, a tambourine and a flute, and they will be prophesying. 
1SA.10.6	Then the 
1SA.10.7	Now when these signs happen to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, for God is with you. 
1SA.10.8	Afterward, you are to go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice fellowship offerings. Seven days you will wait, until I come to you and instruct you what you should do.” 
1SA.10.9	Then it happened, as Saul turned his back to leave Samuel, that God transformed his heart, and all those signs came to pass that day. 
1SA.10.10	When they arrived there, at the hill, behold, a band of prophets did meet him, and suddenly, the 
1SA.10.11	So when all who knew him formerly saw him prophesying with the prophets, they said one to another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.12	(Someone there asked, “Who is their father?”) Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place. 
1SA.10.14	Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To look for the donkeys. But when we saw that they could not be found, we went to Samuel.” 
1SA.10.15	Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me now, what did Samuel say to you?” 
1SA.10.16	“He assured us that the donkeys had been found,” Saul said to his uncle. But concerning the matter of kingship about which Samuel spoke, he told him nothing. 
1SA.10.17	Then Samuel summoned the people to 
1SA.10.18	He said to 
1SA.10.19	But today you have spurned your God, who is your deliverer from all your calamities and your distresses. For you said to Him: ‘No! Rather set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before 
1SA.10.20	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. 
1SA.10.21	Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was chosen. Finally, Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	Therefore, they inquired of 
1SA.10.23	So they ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders up. 
1SA.10.24	Then Samuel announced to all the people, “Do you see the one 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel explained to the people the rules of kingship, wrote them in a scroll and placed it before 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went home to Gibeah, accompanied by men of valor whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	But certain worthless men said, “How can this one save us?” So they despised him and brought him no present. But he kept silent. 
1SA.11.1	Now Nahash the Ammonite marched up and encamped against Jabesh-gilead. Then all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.” 
1SA.11.2	But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “Only on this condition will I make a treaty with you—by gouging out the right eye of every one of you, thus I will bring disgrace on all Israel.” 
1SA.11.3	So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days’ respite, so we may send messengers throughout all the territory of Israel. If no one comes to deliver us, we will surrender to you.” 
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, all the people lifted up their voice and wept. 
1SA.11.5	Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, so Saul asked, “Why are the people weeping?” Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 
1SA.11.6	Then the 
1SA.11.7	So he took a pair of oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen.” So the dread of 
1SA.11.8	He numbered them in Bezek, and 
1SA.11.9	So they said to the messengers who came, “Thus will you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have deliverance.” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, and they were glad. 
1SA.11.10	Then the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you and you can do to us whatever seems good to you.” 
1SA.11.11	So it was on the following day that Saul divided the people into three columns; they penetrated into the midst of the camp at the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of day. It came about that the survivors were scattered, so that no two of them were left together. 
1SA.11.12	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who was it who said, ‘Should Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, so we may put them to death.” 
1SA.11.13	But Saul replied, “No man will be put to death this day, for today 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let’s go to Gilgal and reaffirm the kingdom there.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before 
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all you said to me, and have set a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	Now here is the king who will go before you, while I am old and gray. Also here are my sons with you. I have gone before you from my youth to this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am. Witness against me before 
1SA.12.4	They replied, “You haven’t defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from anyone’s hand.” 
1SA.12.5	Then he said to them, “
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “It is 
1SA.12.7	So now, stand still, so that I may plead with you before 
1SA.12.8	When Jacob entered Egypt and your fathers cried out to 
1SA.12.9	But they forgot 
1SA.12.10	So they cried out to 
1SA.12.11	Then 
1SA.12.12	But when you saw Nahash king of the Ammonites marching against you, you said to me, ‘No! But a king must reign over us!’—even though 
1SA.12.13	“Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen and whom you have asked for, and behold, 
1SA.12.14	If you fear 
1SA.12.15	But if you do not listen to the voice of 
1SA.12.16	Now stand by and see this great thing that 
1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat harvest season today? I will call to 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel prayed to 
1SA.12.19	and all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to 
1SA.12.20	Samuel said to the people, “Fear not! Indeed you have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following 
1SA.12.21	Do not turn aside to go after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are futile. 
1SA.12.22	For 
1SA.12.23	Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against 
1SA.12.24	Only fear 
1SA.12.25	But if you persist in acting wickedly, you will be swept away, both you and your king.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was 30 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for 42 years over Israel. 
1SA.13.2	Now Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel, of which 2,000 were with Saul in Michmas and in the hill country of Beth-el, and 1,000 were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the troops he sent away, each one to his tent. 
1SA.13.3	Now Jonathan struck down the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. So Saul blew the 
1SA.13.4	All Israel heard the news, “Saul had struck down the garrison of the Philistines, so Israel has become a stench to the Philistines.” Then the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal. 
1SA.13.5	Meanwhile the Philistines assembled themselves to fight with Israel: 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They marched up and camped in Michmas, east of Beth-aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because the people were hard-pressed, they hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, crevices and pits. 
1SA.13.7	Some of the Hebrews even crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, but all the people following him were trembling. 
1SA.13.8	So he waited seven days—the time set by Samuel—but Samuel had not come to Gilgal so the people began to scatter from him. 
1SA.13.9	Then Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings,” so he offered the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	But as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet and greet him. 
1SA.13.11	But Samuel asked, “What have you done?” Saul replied, “Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you had not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmas, 
1SA.13.12	I thought: ‘Now the Philistines are about to advance against me at Gilgal, but I have not yet entreated 
1SA.13.13	Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly by not keeping the commandment of 
1SA.13.14	But now your kingship will not last. 
1SA.13.15	Samuel then departed and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Then Saul numbered the troops that were with him, about 600 men. 
1SA.13.16	Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people that were present with them were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmas. 
1SA.13.17	Raiders started to come out from the camp of the Philistines in three detachments: one detachment turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	another detachment turned toward Beth-horon, and the third detachment turned toward the border road overlooking the Zeboim Wadi toward the wilderness. 
1SA.13.19	Now no blacksmith could be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” 
1SA.13.20	So all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his sickle, his axe or his hoe. 
1SA.13.21	The price of sharpening was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the sickles, the three-pronged forks or the axes, or to set the oxgoads.
1SA.13.22	So it came about on the day of battle, there was no sword or spear to be found in the hand of any of the troops that were with Saul and Jonathan—only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. 
1SA.13.23	Then the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmas.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man carrying his armor, “Come, let’s cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that’s on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. 
1SA.14.2	Now Saul was sitting on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that is in Migron, and the troops with him were about 600 men. 
1SA.14.3	Ahijah son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod son of Phinehas son of Eli, the 
1SA.14.4	Between the crossings by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on one side and another rocky crag on the other side—one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	One crag was to the north near Michmas, and the other to the south near Geba. 
1SA.14.6	Then Jonathan said to the young man carrying his armor, “Come, let’s cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised ones. Perhaps 
1SA.14.7	His armor-bearer answered him, “Do whatever is in your heart; go ahead—I’m with you whatever your heart decides.” 
1SA.14.8	Then Jonathan said, “Here, we’ll cross over to the men, then let them see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us: ‘Wait till we come to you,’ then we’ll stand still in our place and will not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up, for 
1SA.14.11	So they both let themselves be seen by the Philistine garrison. “Look, some Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they were hiding,” the Philistines said. 
1SA.14.12	So the men of the garrison shouted down to Jonathan and his armor-bearer saying, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson!” Then Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Follow me, for 
1SA.14.13	So Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. Then they fell before Jonathan, his armor-bearer behind him finishing them off. 
1SA.14.14	That first assault that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made struck down about 20 men within about half a furrow in an acre of land. 
1SA.14.15	Terror then spread through the camp, in the field, and among all the troops. Even the outposts and the raiders also trembled, when the earth quaked—it was a trembling from God. 
1SA.14.16	Now Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin saw the throng scattering away in every direction.
1SA.14.17	So Saul said to the people who were with him, “Call the roll now and see who went from us.” When they called the roll, behold Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 
1SA.14.18	Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God at that time was with 
1SA.14.19	But while Saul was talking to the 
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all the people with him rallied and rushed into the battle. Behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow in utter confusion! 
1SA.14.21	Now there were Hebrews who had defected to the Philistines previously and had gone up with them to their camp round about—even they joined the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. 
1SA.14.22	Also when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they also chased after them in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So 
1SA.14.24	Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed that day, for Saul put the people under oath saying, “Cursed be the man that eats any food before evening, until I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the people tasted food. 
1SA.14.25	But when all the people of the land entered the forest, there was honey on the ground. 
1SA.14.26	When the people entered the forest, indeed, there was a flow of honey, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard when his father made the people swear the oath. So he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb, put his hand to his mouth—and his eyes brightened. 
1SA.14.28	Then, one of the soldiers told him, “Your father strictly put the people under oath saying: ‘Cursed be the man that eats food today.’ But the troops are exhausted.” 
1SA.14.29	Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the people. Just look how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much more, if only the troops had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found? Wouldn’t the slaughter among the Philistines have then been greater?” 
1SA.14.31	That day they struck down the Philistines from Michmas to Aijalon, though the people were so weary. 
1SA.14.32	Then the people rushed greedily upon the plunder, took sheep, oxen and calves, butchered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood. 
1SA.14.33	Then they reported to Saul saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against 
1SA.14.34	Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and tell them: ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and butcher them here and eat. Don’t sin against 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an altar to 
1SA.14.36	Then Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light, we won’t leave any survivors among them.” “Do whatever seems good in your eyes,” they replied. Then the 
1SA.14.37	So Saul inquired of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day. 
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; investigate and see how this sin was committed today. 
1SA.14.39	For as 
1SA.14.40	So he said to all Israel, “You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” “Do what seems good in your eyes,” said the people to Saul. 
1SA.14.41	So Saul said to 
1SA.14.42	Then Saul said, “Cast the lots between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was taken. 
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you’ve done.” Jonathan told him saying, “I certainly did taste a little honey—with the end of the rod that was in my hand. Here I am—I must die!” 
1SA.14.44	“May God do so to me and even more,” Saul said. “You must surely die, Jonathan.” 
1SA.14.45	But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die? It was he who brought about this great deliverance in Israel! Far be it! As 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul broke off pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own country. 
1SA.14.47	After Saul had secured his kingship over Israel, he waged war against all his enemies on every side—against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he punished them. 
1SA.14.48	He did so with valor, ­defeating the Amalekites and delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them. 
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were: the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal. 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Kish was Saul’s father, and Abner’s father was Ner son of Abiel. 
1SA.14.52	Now there was bitter war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. So whenever Saul saw any mighty man or any son of valor, he would gather him to himself. 
1SA.15.1	Then Samuel said to Saul, “
1SA.15.2	Thus says 
1SA.15.3	Now go and strike down Amalek and put all he has under the ban of destruction—so have no pity on him; but kill both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’” 
1SA.15.4	So Saul summoned the troops and numbered them in Telaim: 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Saul advanced to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	Then Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, or else I may destroy you with them—for you showed kindness to all 
1SA.15.7	Then Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, which is close to Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He captured King Agag of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag as well as the best of the sheep, the cattle, even the fatlings and the lambs, and all that was good, since they were not willing to utterly destroy them; everything that was worthless and feeble, they destroyed completely. 
1SA.15.10	Then the word of 
1SA.15.11	“I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” So Samuel was troubled and cried out to 
1SA.15.12	Then Samuel rose early in the morning to confront Saul. But it was reported to Samuel saying, “Saul went to Carmel—for some reason, he erected a monument for himself. Then he turned and went down to Gilgal.” 
1SA.15.13	Now when Samuel reached Saul, Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of 
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “Then what is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?” 
1SA.15.15	“They brought them from the Amalekites,” Saul replied, “for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to 
1SA.15.16	“Stop!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what 
1SA.15.17	Then Samuel said, “Isn’t it true, though you were insignificant in your own eyes, that you were made head of the tribes of Israel? 
1SA.15.18	Then 
1SA.15.19	Why then did you not obey the voice of 
1SA.15.20	“But I did obey the voice of 
1SA.15.21	But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen—the best of what was under the ban of destruction— to sacrifice to 
1SA.15.22	Samuel said: “Does 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is like the sin of divination and stubbornness is like iniquity and idolatry. Since you have rejected 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned! For I have transgressed against the word of 
1SA.15.25	So now, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship 
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of 
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned about to go, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	Then Samuel said to him, “
1SA.15.29	Moreover, the Eternal Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind. For He is not human that He should change His mind.” 
1SA.15.30	Then Saul said, “I have sinned! But please, honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me until I bow in worship to 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul bowed in worship to 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag the king of Amalek.” Agag approached him in chains, thinking, “Surely bitter death has turned back.” 
1SA.15.33	Then Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.” Then Samuel cut Agag into pieces before 
1SA.15.34	Samuel then went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Samuel never did see Saul again until the day of his death. Yet Samuel mourned over Saul, while 
1SA.16.1	Now 
1SA.16.2	But Samuel replied, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” 
1SA.16.3	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will let you know what you are to do. You will anoint for Me whom I tell you.” 
1SA.16.4	So Samuel did what 
1SA.16.5	“In 
1SA.16.6	Upon their arrival, he saw Eliab and thought, “Surely, 
1SA.16.7	But 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. But he said, “Neither has 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah pass by and again he said, “Neither has 
1SA.16.10	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “
1SA.16.11	Then Samuel asked Jesse, “Are these all the boys you have?” “There’s still the youngest,” he replied. But right now, he’s tending the sheep.” “Send and bring him,” Samuel said to Jesse, “for we will not sit down until he comes here.” 
1SA.16.12	So he sent word and had him come. Now he was ruddy-cheeked, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. Then 
1SA.16.13	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. From that day on 
1SA.16.14	Now the 
1SA.16.15	So Saul’s courtiers said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command your courtiers in your service to search for a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then whenever the evil spirit from God comes on you, he will play with his instrument and you will feel better.” 
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his courtiers, “Find me someone who can play well and bring him to me.” 
1SA.16.18	One of the young men answered and said, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite who is skillful in playing music. He is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, a handsome man, and 
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the flock.” 
1SA.16.20	So Jesse took a donkey, loaded it with bread, a bottle of wine and a young goat, and sent them with his son David to Saul. 
1SA.16.21	Then David came to Saul and became one of his attendants. Saul loved him greatly, so David became his armor-bearer. 
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying, “Let David now keep attending me, for he has found favor in my eyes.” 
1SA.16.23	It came to pass, whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand. So Saul would find relief and feel better, as the evil spirit departed from him. 
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines assembled their armies to battle. They were gathered at Socoh of Judah, and camped in Ephes-dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the men of Israel gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, then lined up in battle array against the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines were standing on the mountain on one side, and Israel was standing on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	Then a champion stepped out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
1SA.17.5	He had a bronze helmet on his head and a breastplate of scale armor; the weight of the bronze breastplate was 5,000 shekels. 
1SA.17.6	He also had bronze shin-guards on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders. 
1SA.17.7	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his spear weighed 600 shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer was marching ahead of him. 
1SA.17.8	Then he stood and shouted out to the ranks of Israel saying to them, “Why come out to line up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and aren’t you Saul’s servants? Choose for yourselves a man and let him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we become your slaves; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then will you become our slaves and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	The Philistine added, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel—give me a man, so we may fight together!” 
1SA.17.11	But when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very terrified. 
1SA.17.12	Now David was son of a certain Ephrathite man of Beth-lehem of Judah, whose name was Jesse. He had eight sons and during the days of Saul the man was old, advanced in years among men. 
1SA.17.13	Now the three oldest sons of Jesse had already left and gone after Saul to the battle; the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest. So the three oldest followed Saul. 
1SA.17.15	Now David would go back and forth from Saul to tending his father’s sheep by Beth-lehem. 
1SA.17.16	For forty days that Philistine would come out every morning and evening to present himself. 
1SA.17.17	Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now, for your brothers, an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. 
1SA.17.18	Also take these ten slices of cheese to the captain of their thousand—and check out the welfare of your brothers and bring back some token from them. 
1SA.17.19	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.” 
1SA.17.20	So David rose up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, took the provisions and went as Jesse had commanded him. When he reached the camp, the army was going out to the battle line shouting the war cry. 
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered to check out his brothers’ welfare. 
1SA.17.23	But as he was talking with them, behold the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the ranks of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard them. 
1SA.17.24	Upon seeing him, all the men of Israel fled from him in great fear. 
1SA.17.25	All the men of Israel were saying, “Have you seen this man who keeps coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel! The man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, give him his daughter in marriage and make his father’s house tax-free in Israel!” 
1SA.17.26	Then David asked the men who were standing by him saying, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the ranks of the living God?” 
1SA.17.27	The people answered him with the same speech saying, “Thus it will be done for the man who strikes him down.” 
1SA.17.28	Now when Eliab his oldest brother heard him speaking to the men, Eliab’s anger was kindled against David. “Why have you come down here?” he asked. “So with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart! For you’ve come down here to watch the battle.” 
1SA.17.29	“What have I done now?” David said. “It was only a question!” 
1SA.17.30	Then he turned away from him toward someone else and asked the same question. So the people gave him the same answer as before. 
1SA.17.31	The words that David said were overheard and reported before Saul. So he was taken to him. 
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Let no one’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 
1SA.17.33	Then Saul said to David, “You can’t go fight this Philistine—for you’re just a youth, and he’s been a warrior since his youth.” 
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb out of the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went out after it, struck it down, and rescued the lamb out of its mouth. If it rose up against me, I grabbed him by its fur, struck it and killed it. 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear, so this uncircumcised Philistine will become like one of them—since he has defied the ranks of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	Then David said, “
1SA.17.38	Then Saul clothed David with his own garb, put a bronze helmet on his head, and clothed him in armor. 
1SA.17.39	David strapped his sword on his garment and tried to walk, but he was not used to it. So David said to Saul, “I cannot walk in these, for I am not used to them.” So David took them off. 
1SA.17.40	Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the valley, put them in the pocket of the shepherd’s bag that he had, and with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. 
1SA.17.41	Meanwhile, the Philistine drew nearer and approached David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	Now when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was just a ruddy boy with a handsome appearance. 
1SA.17.43	Then the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, so I may give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.” 
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You are coming to me with a sword, a spear and a javelin, but I am coming to you in the Name of 
1SA.17.46	This very day 
1SA.17.47	and so all this assembly will know that 
1SA.17.48	Then when the Philistine rose and began to advance, drawing near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	David put his hand in his bag, took from it a stone and slung it, striking the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground. 
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, struck the Philistine down and killed him. Since there was no sword in David’s hand, 
1SA.17.51	David ran, stood over the Philistine, picked up his sword, drew it from its sheath, slew him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	Then the men of Israel and Judah rose up, shouted and pursued the Philistines all the way to the valley up to the gates of Ekron. The slain Philistines fell down along the way to Shaaraim, even up to Gath and Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	When 
1SA.17.54	David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his own tent. 
1SA.17.55	Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this boy?” Abner said, “As your soul lives, your majesty, I don’t know.” 
1SA.17.56	So the king said, “Then, find out whose son this young man is.” 
1SA.17.57	So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	“Whose son are you, young man?” Saul said to him. David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.”
1SA.18.1	Now it came to pass, when David had finished speaking to Saul, Jonathan’s soul was knit to David’s soul, and Jonathan loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.2	Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father’s house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan cut a covenant with David, because he loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan stripped off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, along with his armor: his sword, bow and belt.
1SA.18.5	So David went out wherever Saul sent him and had success, so Saul set him over the men of war. It was pleasing in the eyes of all the people as well as in the eyes of Saul’s courtiers. 
1SA.18.6	Upon their coming back, upon David’s return from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, singing and dancing in circles to greet King Saul, with timbrels, with joy and with three-stringed instruments. 
1SA.18.7	So the women sang one to another, as they were dancing saying, “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands!” 
1SA.18.8	Then Saul became very angry—this saying was evil in his eyes—and he commented, “They’ve ascribed to David ten thousands and to me they’ve ascribed thousands. Now what more does he lack but the kingdom?” 
1SA.18.9	So Saul eyed David from that day on. 
1SA.18.10	It came about the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, so that he was raving within the palace. While David was playing music with his hand, as he did day by day, Saul had his spear in his hand, 
1SA.18.11	and Saul hurled the spear, thinking, “I’ll pin David to the wall!” But David eluded him—twice. 
1SA.18.12	Now Saul became afraid of David, because 
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from his entourage by appointing him as a captain of a thousand. So David went out and came in before the troops. 
1SA.18.14	David had success in all his undertakings, since 
1SA.18.15	When Saul saw that he had great success, he dreaded him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them. 
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab—I give her to you as a wife. Only continue to be my son of valor and fight 
1SA.18.18	But David replied to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?” 
1SA.18.19	But when it was time to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David in marriage, she was given as wife to Adriel the Meholathite instead.
1SA.18.20	Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David. When they told Saul, the matter pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	Saul thought, “I will give her to him, so that she may become a snare to him—and the hand of the Philistines will be against him.” So Saul said to David, “You can still become my son-in-law, even today, with the second one.” 
1SA.18.22	Then Saul commanded his courtiers, “Speak with David privately and say, ‘Behold, the king delights in you and all his courtiers love you. So now, become the king’s son-in-law!’” 
1SA.18.23	So Saul’s courtiers whispered these words in David’s ears. But David said, “Is it a light thing to you becoming the king’s son-in-law, considering that I am a poor man and of little account?” 
1SA.18.24	Saul’s courtiers reported back to him what David had said. 
1SA.18.25	Then Saul said, “Thus you will say to David, ‘The king desires no bridal dowry except 100 foreskins of the Philistines—to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” So Saul schemed to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	When his courtiers told David these words, the word seemed right in David’s eyes to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the days were fulfilled, 
1SA.18.27	 David had risen, gone with his men and killed 200 Philistine men. Then David brought their foreskins and gave them in full number to the king—to become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife. 
1SA.18.28	When Saul saw and realized that 
1SA.18.29	Saul grew even more afraid of David. Thus Saul became David’s enemy for all days. 
1SA.18.30	When the chiefs of the Philistines marched out, as often as they came out, David proved more successful than all of Saul’s officers. So his name became highly esteemed. 
1SA.19.1	Now Saul told his son Jonathan and all his courtiers to kill David. But Saul’s son Jonathan delighted much in David. 
1SA.19.2	So Jonathan informed David saying, “My father Saul is seeking to kill you. So now, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you will be, and I will speak with my father about you. If I notice anything, I will tell you.” 
1SA.19.4	So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul and said to him, “May the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial for you; 
1SA.19.5	For he put his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and 
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “As 
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul and in his presence as before. 
1SA.19.8	Once again war broke out, and David marched out and fought the Philistines, and inflicted a great slaughter on them and they fled before him. 
1SA.19.9	Yet once again an evil spirit from 
1SA.19.10	Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s face, so that he drove the spear into the wall. That night David fled and got away. 
1SA.19.11	Then Saul sent agents to David’s house to watch him, in order to kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michal warned him saying, “If you don’t escape for your life tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!” 
1SA.19.12	So Michal lowered David down through the window, and thus he went, fled and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took a household idol, laid it in the bed, put a quilt of goats’ hair at the head and covered it with a cloth. 
1SA.19.14	When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, “He’s sick.” 
1SA.19.15	So Saul sent the agents back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed so I may put him to death.” 
1SA.19.16	When the messengers came in, behold, the household idol was in the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head. 
1SA.19.17	Saul then said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy get away, so that he escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go or I’ll kill you!’” 
1SA.19.18	So David fled and escaped, went to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	Saul was told, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.20	So Saul sent agents to seize David, but they saw a band of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing and presiding over them. Then the 
1SA.19.21	When Saul was told, he sent other agents and they too prophesied. Then Saul sent a third group of messengers, and they too prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Then he himself went to Ramah, and when he arrived at the great cistern in Secu, he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” Someone answered, “Look, they are at Naioth at Ramah.” 
1SA.19.23	So he proceeded there, to Naioth at Ramah, and the 
1SA.19.24	Then he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. That is why people were saying, “Is Saul too among the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah, came before Jonathan and said, “What have I done? What is my crime? What is my sin against your father that he should be seeking my life?” 
1SA.20.2	“Never!” he said to him. “You will not die! Behold, my father does nothing great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this matter from me? It cannot be.” 
1SA.20.3	Then David swore again saying, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes. So he must have thought, ‘Let’s not let Jonathan know about this, else he will be grieved.’ But truly as 
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you!” 
1SA.20.5	So David said to Jonathan, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon, when I am supposed to sit down with the king to eat. Instead, let me go hide myself in the countryside until the third evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then say: ‘David earnestly asked my permission to run to Beth-lehem, his town, for it is the annual sacrifice there for the whole family.’ 
1SA.20.7	If he says thus, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe; but if he becomes very angry, then know that he is determined to harm me. 
1SA.20.8	Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of 
1SA.20.9	Jonathan replied, “Far be it from you! For if I know for sure that my father has determined evil to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you about it?” 
1SA.20.10	Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 
1SA.20.11	Jonathan said to David, “Come, let’s go out to the field.” So they both went out to the field. 
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David, “By 
1SA.20.13	May 
1SA.20.14	“Now if I am still alive, wouldn’t you show me the loyal love of 
1SA.20.15	Yet also, don’t cut off your loyal love from my household ever—not even when 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan cut a covenant with the house of David, “So may 
1SA.20.17	Jonathan made David swear again because of the love he had for him, for he loved him as he loved himself. 
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the New Moon. You’ll be missed because your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	On the third day, you must go down quickly and come to the place where you hid as you did on that day, and remain close to the stone Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. 
1SA.20.21	Now look, I will send a lad saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I specifically say to the lad, ‘See, the arrows are on this side of you—get them,’ then come; for it is safe for you and no danger, as 
1SA.20.22	But if I say to the boy: ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go your way, for 
1SA.20.23	But as for the matter which I and you have spoken about, behold, 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field, and when the New Moon came, the king sat down to eat a meal. 
1SA.20.25	So the king sat on his seat—as usual, the seat by the wall—Jonathan stood up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless, Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “It must be an accident; he must be ceremonially unclean—yes, that’s it, he’s unclean.” 
1SA.20.27	Yet it came to pass on the day following the New Moon, the second day, that David’s place was still empty. So Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why didn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal yesterday or today?” 
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem, 
1SA.20.29	as he said, ‘Please let me go, for we are going to have a family feast in the town, and my brother has commanded me. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me go, please, to see my brothers. That’s why he hasn’t come to the king’s table.” 
1SA.20.30	Then Saul’s rage blazed against Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse—to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on earth, neither you nor your kingship will be secure. Now, send word and bring him to me, for he is a son of death!” 
1SA.20.32	But Jonathan answered his father Saul, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. 
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan rose up from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food the second day of the new month, for he was grieved over David, because his father had dishonored him. 
1SA.20.35	It came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad was with him. 
1SA.20.36	He said to his lad, “Run, find now the arrows that I am about to shoot.” Now as the lad was running, he shot an arrow past him. 
1SA.20.37	When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” 
1SA.20.38	Then Jonathan called out after the lad, “Quick, hurry! Don’t stand there!” So Jonathan’s lad picked up the arrow and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, “Go, take them back to the town.” 
1SA.20.41	As soon as the lad was gone, David emerged from the south side and fell on his face to the ground and bowed down three times. Then they kissed each other and wept together, though David wept more. 
1SA.20.42	Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in the 
1SA.21.1	Then David got up and left, while Jonathan returned to the town. 
1SA.21.2	David went to Nob to Ahimelech the 
1SA.21.3	David said to Ahimelech the 
1SA.21.4	So now, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever can be found.” 
1SA.21.5	The 
1SA.21.6	“Of course women have been kept from us, as on previous campaigns,” David answered the 
1SA.21.7	So the 
1SA.21.8	Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before 
1SA.21.9	Then David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there a spear or sword on hand? For I did not take my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s mission was urgent.” 
1SA.21.10	The 
1SA.21.11	Then David got up and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish, king of Gath. 
1SA.21.12	But Achish’s courtiers said to him, “Isn’t this David king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?’” 
1SA.21.13	David took these words to heart, and he became so afraid of King Achish of Gath 
1SA.21.14	that he changed his demeanor before them and acted like a mad man while in their hands—scribbling on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard. 
1SA.21.15	Then Achish said to his courtiers, “Look, you can see the man is insane. Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.16	Do I have a shortage of crazy people that you’ve brought this fellow to go crazy on me? Is this one going to come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	So David walked from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard about it, they went down there to him. 
1SA.22.2	Anyone who was in distress, anyone in debt, and anyone embittered rallied around him, and he became their leader. There were about 400 men with him. 
1SA.22.3	Then David left from there to Mizpah of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please, let my father and my mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	Then he brought them to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. 
1SA.22.5	But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth. 
1SA.22.6	Then Saul heard that David and the men with him were located. Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the height, spear in his hand, and all his courtiers were attending him. 
1SA.22.7	Saul said to his courtiers standing about him, “Listen now, Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds? 
1SA.22.8	Yet all of you have conspired against me, and there was nobody disclosing to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse! None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush—as is the case today?” 
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing among Saul’s courtiers, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob—to Ahimelech son of Ahitub—
1SA.22.10	and he inquired of 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent word to summon the 
1SA.22.12	“Listen now, son of Ahitub,” Saul said. “Here I am, my lord,” he said. 
1SA.22.13	Then Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me—you and the son of Jesse—by giving him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him, that he should rise against me by lying in ambush, as is the case today?” 
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king saying, “Who among all your servants is as trusted as David, the king’s son-in-law, a captain of the royal guard, and honored in your house? 
1SA.22.15	Just today I began to inquire of God for him? Far be it from the king to accuse his servant or to anyone of my father’s house. For your servant knows nothing of all this, whether little or much.” 
1SA.22.16	But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house.” 
1SA.22.17	Then the king ordered the guards attending him, “Turn around and kill the 
1SA.22.18	So the king said to Doeg, “You, turn around and kill the 
1SA.22.19	Nob, the town of the 
1SA.22.20	Yet one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. 
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had slain 
1SA.22.22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have brought about the death of all the people of your father’s house. 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me, and fear not; for the one who is seeking my life is seeking your life too—but with me you will be safe.”
1SA.23.1	Then they reported to David saying, “Look, the Philistines are raiding Keilah and they are plundering the threshing floors.” 
1SA.23.2	So David inquired of 
1SA.23.3	But David’s fellow men said to him, “Look, we’re afraid here in Judah; how much more so if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces?” 
1SA.23.4	Once again David inquired of 
1SA.23.5	So David and his fellow men went to Keilah and fought against the Philistines, drove off their livestock and inflicted a great slaughter on them. Thus David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	It came about, when Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
1SA.23.7	Now when Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand! For he shut himself in by entering a town with barred gates.” 
1SA.23.8	So Saul summoned all the troops for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his fellow men. 
1SA.23.9	Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him, so he said to Abiathar the 
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? 
1SA.23.12	Then David asked, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my fellow men into the hand of Saul?” “They will surrender,” 
1SA.23.13	Then David and his fellow men, about 600, got up and left Keilah, and went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he stopped the pursuit. 
1SA.23.14	So David stayed in the strongholds of the wilderness, remaining in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not give him into his hand. 
1SA.23.15	By now David was aware that Saul would come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Choresh. 
1SA.23.16	Then Saul’s son Jonathan arose and went to David at Choresh and strengthened him in God. 
1SA.23.17	“Don’t be afraid,” he said to him, “because my father Saul will never find you. You will be king over Israel and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul recognizes that.” 
1SA.23.18	Again they cut a covenant before 
1SA.23.19	Then some of the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gibeah, saying, “Isn’t David hiding with us in the strongholds at Choresh, in the hill of Hachilah which is south of Jeshimon? 
1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come down whenever it is a desire of your soul to come down—our part will be to deliver him into the king’s hand.” 
1SA.23.21	“May you be blessed of 
1SA.23.22	Go now, make more sure, investigate and scout out his place where he usually goes and who has seen him there. For I have been told that he is very cunning. 
1SA.23.23	Look around and see in which of all the hiding places he has been hiding, and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the area, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.” 
1SA.23.24	Then they got up and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. But David and his men were then in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	So when Saul and his men began the search, David was informed. Then he went down to the rocky area and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. On hearing this, Saul pursued David in the wilderness of Maon. 
1SA.23.26	Then, while Saul was advancing on one side of the mountain, David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to elude Saul. Meanwhile Saul and his men were closing-in on David and his men to seize them. 
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul had to return from chasing after David, and go to engage the Philistines. Therefore they called that place the Rock of Separation. 
1SA.23.29	From there David went up and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1SA.24.1	Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him saying, “Look, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.” 
1SA.24.2	So Saul took 3,000 chosen men from all Israel and went to search for David and his men near the rocks of the mountain goats. 
1SA.24.3	When he came across the sheepfolds along the way where there was a cave, Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were already sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. 
1SA.24.4	So David’s men said to him, “Look, it’s the day 
1SA.24.5	But afterward, David’s conscience bothered him for cutting off the edge of Saul’s robe. 
1SA.24.6	So he said to his fellow men, “
1SA.24.7	So David persuaded his fellow men with these words and did not let them rise against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way. 
1SA.24.8	David also rose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out after Saul saying, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and prostrated himself. 
1SA.24.9	Then David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words saying: ‘Look, David intends you harm’? 
1SA.24.10	Look, today your own eyes should see how 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, see! Yes, look at the corner of your robe in my hand! For in cutting off the corner of your robe, yet not killing you, you should know and realize that there is no evil or rebellion in my hand. I haven’t sinned against you, even though you are lying in wait for my life, to take it. 
1SA.24.12	May 
1SA.24.13	As the old proverb goes, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’—but my hand will never be on you. 
1SA.24.14	Whom has the king of Israel come after? Who are you chasing? A dead dog? A single flea? 
1SA.24.15	May 
1SA.24.16	Now when David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son, David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept aloud. 
1SA.24.17	Then he said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have done good to me, while I have done evil to you. 
1SA.24.18	You’ve told today how well you’ve dealt with me, for 
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away on a good road? May 
1SA.24.20	Now behold, I know for certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will rise in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	Swear now to me by 
1SA.24.22	So David swore to Saul. Then Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. 
1SA.25.1	Then Samuel died, and all Israel gathered and lamented him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. David then arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
1SA.25.2	Now there was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel, and the man was so wealthy, he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. At that time he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	The man’s name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful, but the man, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings. 
1SA.25.4	While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So David dispatched ten young men, and said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and when you reach Nabal, greet him in my name. 
1SA.25.6	Thus you will say: ‘Long life! And 
1SA.25.7	Now I hear that you have shearers. When your shepherds were with us, we did them no harm and nothing of theirs was missing all the time they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore, let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. So please, give to your servants and to your son David, whatever you find at hand.’” 
1SA.25.9	David’s young men went and told Nabal all those words in David’s name, and waited. 
1SA.25.10	But Nabal answered David’s servants by saying, “Who is David? And who is Jesse’s son? Nowadays there are many slaves each running away from his master. 
1SA.25.11	So should I take my bread, my water and my meat that I have cooked for my shearers, and give it to men whom I don’t know where they come from?” 
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men turned around and went back. When they came and reported to him all these words, 
1SA.25.13	David said to his men, “Everyone buckle on your sword!” So each man buckled on his sword and David also buckled on his sword. About 400 men went up following David, while 200 stayed with the baggage. 
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Nabal’s wife Abigail saying, “Look, David had sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he spurned them. 
1SA.25.15	Yet the men were very good to us. We were not harmed, nor were we missing anything as long as we went about with them while we were in the fields. 
1SA.25.16	They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time that we were with them tending the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his household. But he is such a worthless fellow that no one can speak to him.” 
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail hurried and took 200 loaves, two bottles of wine, five dressed sheep, five measures of roasted corn, 100 cakes of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs, and put them on donkeys. 
1SA.25.19	Then she said to her young men, “Go on ahead of me—see, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	As she was riding on the donkey and going down by the hidden pass of the mountain, behold, David and his men were coming down towards her, so she met them. 
1SA.25.21	Now David had been saying, “Surely in vain I’ve guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missing of all that belonged to him—yet he has returned me evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	May God do so and even more to David’s enemies if by the morning I leave even one male of all who belong to him!” 
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted from her donkey, fell before David on her face and bowed down to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	As she fell at his feet, she pleaded, “On me, only me, my lord, be the punishment! But please, let your maidservant speak in your ears, and listen to the words of your maidservant. 
1SA.25.25	Please my lord, pay no attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he—Nabal is his name and disgraceful folly is with him. But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent. 
1SA.25.26	“So now my lord, as 
1SA.25.27	Now let this blessing, which your maidservant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who are accompanying my lord. 
1SA.25.28	Please, forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For 
1SA.25.29	If anyone rises to pursue you and seek your life, then let my lord’s life be bound up in the bundle of the living—with 
1SA.25.30	“So when 
1SA.25.31	then this will not be a stumbling-block for you, or offense of heart to my lord, or needless bloodshed by my lord avenging himself. So when 
1SA.25.32	Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be 
1SA.25.33	Blessed be your discernment, and may you be blessed for keeping me this day from shedding blood, from avenging myself with my own hand. 
1SA.25.34	Yet as 
1SA.25.35	So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up in 
1SA.25.36	Then Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was holding a banquet in his house like that of a king—Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was quite drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. 
1SA.25.37	It came to pass in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, and his wife told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he was paralyzed like a stone. 
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be 
1SA.25.40	When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they told her, “David has sent us to you, to take you as his wife.” 
1SA.25.41	So she rose, bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” 
1SA.25.42	Then Abigail rose quickly and mounted a donkey, with five of her maidens following her, following David’s messengers, and she became his wife. 
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and the two of them were his wives. 
1SA.25.44	Meanwhile Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was of Gallim. 
1SA.26.1	Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah saying, “Isn’t David hiding on the hill of Hachilah which faces Jeshimon?” 
1SA.26.2	So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, 3,000 chosen men of Israel with him, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah which faces Jeshimon, by the road. But David was staying in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness. 
1SA.26.4	So David sent out spies and realized that Saul had already arrived. 
1SA.26.5	Then David got up and went to the place where Saul had camped. David detected the spot where Saul lay asleep, as well as Abner son of Ner his army commander. Saul was lying inside the barricade and the troops were camped around him. 
1SA.26.6	Then David spoke and asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” “I will go down with you,” Abishai answered. 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai approached the troops by night. Behold, Saul was lying asleep within the barricade with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the troops were sleeping around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now let me pin him to the ground with a single thrust of the spear. I will not have to strike him twice.” 
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! For who can lay his hand on 
1SA.26.10	David added, “As 
1SA.26.11	 forbid that I should lay my hand on 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the water jar from beside Saul’s head. They got away—and no one saw it, or knew it, or woke up—for all were asleep, for a deep sleep from 
1SA.26.13	Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of a distant hill with a wide space between them. 
1SA.26.14	David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner saying, “Aren’t you going to answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered saying, “Who are you, who called out to the king?” 
1SA.26.15	“Aren’t you a man?” David said to Abner. “Indeed, who is like you in Israel? So, why didn’t you guard your lord the king? For one of the troops came in to kill the king your lord. 
1SA.26.16	This thing that you’ve done is no good. As 
1SA.26.17	Saul then recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, David my son?” “It is my voice, my lord the king,” David said, 
1SA.26.18	then added, “Yet why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand? 
1SA.26.19	Now please, let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If 
1SA.26.20	So now, let not my blood fall to the ground, away from the presence of 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul replied, “I have sinned! Return, David my son, for I will no longer do you harm, since my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I’ve played the fool and erred so seriously.” 
1SA.26.22	David then answered and said, “There is the king’s spear! Let one of the young men cross over and take it. 
1SA.26.23	 will repay everyone his righteousness and his faithfulness. For 
1SA.26.24	See, just as your life was highly valued in my eyes today, so let my life be highly valued in 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, David my son! You will both do mightily and will surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place. 
1SA.27.1	Then David said in his heart, “One day I’ll be swept away by the hand of Saul. There’s nothing better for me than to escape immediately to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me in all the territories of Israel, so I’ll escape from his hand.” 
1SA.27.2	So David rose and crossed over, he and the 600 men that were with him, to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David stayed with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives—Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow. 
1SA.27.4	So when Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him. 
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let me be given a place in one of the country towns, so I may live there. Why should your servant stay in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	So Achish granted him Ziklag that day. Thus Ziklag came to belong to the kings of Judah to this day. 
1SA.27.7	The number of days that David stayed in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months. 
1SA.27.8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Gizrites and the Amalekites, for those were inhabitants of the region from ancient times, as you go all the way from Shur and as far as the land of Egypt. 
1SA.27.9	David attacked the region and was leaving not a man or woman alive, and took away sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels and clothing. When he returned and came to Achish, 
1SA.27.10	Achish would ask, “Where have you raided today?” So David would reply, “Against the Negev of Judah, against the Negev of the Jerahmeelite and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 
1SA.27.11	David left no man or woman alive to bring to Gath, thinking, “Unless they should tell about us, saying: ‘So did David.’” So was his practice all the time he stayed in the country of the Philistines. 
1SA.27.12	Then Achish trusted David, saying, “He has certainly made himself abhorrent to his people Israel; therefore, he will be my vassal forever.”
1SA.28.1	At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You surely know that you and your men must march out with me in the army.” 
1SA.28.2	David said to Achish, “Well then, you know what your servant will do.” “Well then, I appoint you my bodyguard for life,” Achish said to David. 
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, his hometown. Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists. 
1SA.28.4	So the Philistines mustered and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	Now when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. 
1SA.28.6	When Saul inquired of 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his courtiers, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go to her and inquire through her.” So his courtiers said to him, “Behold, there is a woman that is a medium at En-dor.” 
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself, put on other clothes, and went with two other men, and they reached the woman by night. Then he said, “Please conjure up for me a ghost—bring up for me the one I will name to you.” 
1SA.28.9	“Look, you know what Saul has done,” she said, “how he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. So why then are you setting a trap for my life to get me killed?” 
1SA.28.10	Saul vowed to her by 
1SA.28.11	“Whom will I bring up for you?” the woman asked. “Bring me up Samuel,” he said. 
1SA.28.12	But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud shriek. Then the woman spoke to Saul saying, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!” 
1SA.28.13	“Don’t be afraid!” the king said to her. “What do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a godlike being coming up from the earth.” 
1SA.28.14	“What does he look like?” he asked her. “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe,” she said. Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, so he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 
1SA.28.15	Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” “I’m in great distress,” Saul answered. “The Philistines are waging war against me, and God has turned away from me—He doesn’t answer me anymore, whether by prophets or by dreams. So I called you up to tell me what I should do.” 
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “So why ask me, since 
1SA.28.17	Now 
1SA.28.18	Since you did not obey the voice of 
1SA.28.19	Moreover, 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground, and became so terrified because of the words of Samuel that there was absolutely no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night. 
1SA.28.21	Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was so agitated, so she told him, “Behold, your maidservant obeyed you; I put my life in my hand by listening to your words, which you spoke to me. 
1SA.28.22	Please you too listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you, so you can eat and have strength to go on your way.” 
1SA.28.23	But he refused and said, “I won’t eat.” But when his courtiers and the woman urged him, he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fatted calf in the house, so she hurried and butchered it, and took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it. 
1SA.28.25	She brought it before Saul and his courtiers, and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines mustered all their armies at Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	As the Philistine lords were proceeding ahead of their hundreds and thousands, David and his men were bringing up the rear with Achish. 
1SA.29.3	Then the Philistine commanders said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” Achish said to the Philistine commanders, “No! That’s David, servant of Israel’s King Saul—he’s been with me today for over a year, and I’ve not found any fault in him since the day he defected to me until now.” 
1SA.29.4	But the Philistine commanders got angry with him, and the Philistine commanders said to him, “Make this man go back—back to his place you assigned him. He must not go down with us to the battle, or in the battle he might become our adversary. For how would this fellow appease his lord? Wouldn’t it be with the heads of our men? 
1SA.29.5	Isn’t this one David, about whom they were singing in dances saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?’” 
1SA.29.6	So Achish called David and said to him, “As 
1SA.29.7	So now, turn around and go back in peace, and you won’t be doing anything to displease the Philistine lords.” 
1SA.29.8	“But what have I done?” David said to Achish. “What have you found in your servant from the day I have been before you to this day, that I shouldn’t go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
1SA.29.9	“I know,” Achish answered saying to David. “You are as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	So now, rise up early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord that came with you, and as soon you rise, early in the morning, once there is light, leave.” 
1SA.29.11	So David rose up early, he and his men, leaving in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. Meanwhile, the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 
1SA.30.1	Now it came to pass, when David and his men returned to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag, and had attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire; 
1SA.30.2	taking the women in it captive, young and old, without killing anyone, but carried them off as they went their way. 
1SA.30.3	So when David and his men came to the town, behold, it was burned with fire—and their wives, their sons and their daughters had been taken captives. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the troops with him lifted up their voice and wept until they there was no more strength in them to weep. 
1SA.30.5	Even David’s two wives were taken captive—Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow. 
1SA.30.6	So David was in a serious bind, for the troops were calling for his stoning, for all the troops were bitter of soul, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in 
1SA.30.7	Then David said to Abiathar the 
1SA.30.8	David inquired of 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the 600 men with him, and came to the Wadi Besor, where those left behind remained—
1SA.30.10	for 200 men stayed behind because they were too exhausted to cross Wadi Besor. Yet David pursued, he and the other 400 men. 
1SA.30.11	Then they found an Egyptian in the open field and brought him to David, gave him bread to eat and water to drink, 
1SA.30.12	and they also gave him a piece of fig cake and two cakes of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came back to him, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and three nights. 
1SA.30.13	Then David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” “I am a young Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite,” he said. “My master abandoned me three days ago because I fell sick. 
1SA.30.14	We made a raid in the Negev of the Cherethites, and on Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb; also we burned Ziklag with fire.” 
1SA.30.15	Then David asked him, “Will you lead me to this raiding band?” “Swear to me by God that you won’t kill me or deliver me into my master’s hands,” he said, “and I will lead you to this marauding band.” 
1SA.30.16	So he led him down, and behold, they were scattered over all the area, eating, drinking and feasting because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David attacked them from the twilight until the evening of the next day. None of them escaped, except 400 young men who rode on camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	There was nothing of theirs missing, whether young or old, sons or daughters, spoils or anything else that had been carried off—David recovered everything. 
1SA.30.20	David took all the flocks and the herd that they had driven ahead of the other cattle, so they said, “This is David’s spoil.” 
1SA.30.21	When David reached the 200 men—who had been too exhausted to follow David and were left at Wadi Besor—they came out to meet David and to meet the men with him, so David approached these people and greeted them. 
1SA.30.22	But all the wicked men and worthless fellows among those who accompanied David said, “Because they did not accompany us, we shouldn’t give them any of the spoil that we’ve recovered, except every man may take his wife and his children and leave.” 
1SA.30.23	“You must not do so, my brothers with what 
1SA.30.24	Who would listen to you in this matter? The share of him who went down to the battle is to be the same as that of him who remained by the baggage. They will share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	So it has been from that day forward—he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day. 
1SA.30.26	When David arrived at Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Look, a blessing for you from the spoil of the enemies of 
1SA.30.27	to those in Beth-el, Ramoth-Negev, Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	Racal, to those in the towns of Jerahmeelite, to those in the towns of the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	Hebron and to all the places where David and his men had roamed.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. Israel’s men fled before the Philistines and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
1SA.31.3	When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers hit him, so he was severely wounded by the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, or else these uncircumcised will come and thrust me through after torturing me.” But his armor-bearer refused, for he was too afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that same day. 
1SA.31.7	When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the towns and fled. Then the Philistines came and occupied them. 
1SA.31.8	It was the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines, to spread the good news to the house of their idols and to the people. 
1SA.31.10	Then they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth and fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
1SA.31.11	Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all their valiant men set out and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, then went to Jabesh and burned them there. 
1SA.31.13	They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted for seven days.
2SA.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul—when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites—that David stayed two days in Ziklag. 
2SA.1.2	On the third day, behold, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes torn and dust on his head. Now when he approached David, he fell to the ground and prostrated himself. 
2SA.1.3	Then David asked him, “Where are you coming from?” “I’ve escaped from the camp of Israel,” he answered. 
2SA.1.4	“How did things go?” David asked him. “Please, tell me.” He answered, “The troops fled the battlefield—also many of the troops fell and died. And even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.” 
2SA.1.5	David asked the young man informing him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 
2SA.1.6	The young man informing him answered, “I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, and look, Saul was leaning on his spear, while the chariots and the horsemen were closing in on him. 
2SA.1.7	When he turned around and saw me, he called me. So I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	Then he asked me, ‘Who are you?’ “So I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
2SA.1.9	So he said to me, ‘Stand now over me and kill me! For I’m in agony, yet I’m still alive.’ 
2SA.1.10	So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew he couldn’t survive after he had fallen. Then I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and brought them here—to my lord.” 
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men that were with him, 
2SA.1.12	and they mourned, wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, for the troops of 
2SA.1.13	Then David said to the young man who informed him, “Where are you from?” “I am a son of an Amalekite outsider,” he replied. 
2SA.1.14	Then David said to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy 
2SA.1.15	Then David called one of the young men and said, “Come and strike him down.” And he struck him down and he died. 
2SA.1.16	David said to him, “Your blood is on your own head, for your mouth testified against you saying, ‘I killed 
2SA.1.17	Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	and ordered that the sons of Judah be taught the “Song of the Bow.” (Behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar): 
2SA.1.19	“Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen! 
2SA.1.20	Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in Ashkelon’s streets, lest Philistine daughters rejoice, lest daughters of the uncircumcised gloat! 
2SA.1.21	Hills of Gilboa, let no dew or rain be on you, nor on bountiful fields, for there the shield of the mighty ones lay defiled—Saul’s shield will no longer be anointed with oil. 
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan’s bow never turned back, Saul’s sword never returned empty. 
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan, loved and delightful, parted neither in life nor death. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions. 
2SA.1.24	Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who put ornaments of gold on your clothes. 
2SA.1.25	How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan on your heights is slain! 
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan! Very pleasing were you to me. Wonderful was your love to me more than the love of women. 
2SA.1.27	How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war destroyed!
2SA.2.1	Now it came to pass after this that David inquired of 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there, along with his two wives—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 
2SA.2.3	David also brought up his men that were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the towns of Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came and there anointed David king over the house of Judah. Then they told David saying, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.” 
2SA.2.5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, “Blessed are you of 
2SA.2.6	So now may 
2SA.2.7	Now therefore, be strong and brave, for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	Now Abner son of Ner, Saul’s army commander, had taken Saul’s son Ish-bosheth, and brought him over to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.9	Then he made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin—over all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Saul’s son Ish-bosheth was 40 years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
2SA.2.12	Once Abner son of Ner and the troops of Saul’s son Ish-bosheth went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Meanwhile Joab son of Zeruiah and the troops of David went out—they met each other by the pool of Gibeon, so they sat down, one group on one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Now let the young men get up and compete before us.” “Let them get up,” Joab replied. 
2SA.2.15	Then they got up and came forward by number—12 for Benjamin and for Saul’s son Ish-bosheth and 12 from David’s servants. 
2SA.2.16	Then each grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they all fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 
2SA.2.17	The battle was very fierce that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before David’s servants. 
2SA.2.18	Now the three sons of Zeruiah were Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles of the field. 
2SA.2.19	Asahel pursued Abner, not swerving to the right or to the left from pursuing Abner. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is it you, Asahel?” “It is I,” he answered. 
2SA.2.21	So Abner said to him, “Turn away to your right or to your left, seize one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn away from following him. 
2SA.2.22	Once again Abner warned Asahel, “Turn away from pursuing me! Why should I strike you to the ground? How would I ever look your brother Joab in the face?” 
2SA.2.23	But he refused to turn aside, so Abner struck him with the butt end of the spear in the groin, so that the spear came out through his back, and he fell down there and died on the spot. When all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, they stood still. 
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai continued pursuing Abner. As the sun was setting, they reached the hill of Ammah, which faces Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	Then the sons of Benjamin rallied to Abner and became one group, taking their stand on top of one of the hills. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called out to Joab and said, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize how bitter it will be in the end? How long until you order the people to stop pursuing their kinsmen?” 
2SA.2.27	“As God lives,” Joab replied, “if you had not spoken, then surely the people would have gone up until the morning, everyone after his kinsman.” 
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the 
2SA.2.29	So Abner and his men marched all that night through the Arabah, then they crossed over the Jordan, and marched through all morning until they reached Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.30	Joab returned from pursuing Abner, and when he had gathered all the troops, nineteen of David’s soldiers besides Asahel were missing. 
2SA.2.31	But David’s soldiers had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men, so that 360 men died. 
2SA.2.32	Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Beth-lehem. Joab and his men marched all night, until the day dawned on them at Hebron. 
2SA.3.1	Now the war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. While David grew steadily stronger, the house of Saul grew steadily weaker. 
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam of Jezreel; 
2SA.3.3	his second was Chileab by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third was Absalom son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	the fourth was Adonijah son of Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah son of Abital; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron. 
2SA.3.6	During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner strengthened his position in the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you slept with my father’s concubine?” 
2SA.3.8	But Abner became very angry over Ish-bosheth’s words and said, “Am I a dog’s head from Judah? To this day I’ve been loyal to the house of Saul your father, to his kinsmen, and to his friends, and I haven’t handed you over to David—yet today you are accusing me of wrongdoing with this woman. 
2SA.3.9	May God do so to Abner and even more if, as 
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba!” 
2SA.3.11	But Ish-bosheth could not respond to Abner another word, because he was afraid of him. 
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and see, my hand will be with you to bring all Israel over to you.” 
2SA.3.13	“Good!” said David. “I will cut a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you will not see my face unless you first bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to see my face.” 
2SA.3.14	Then David sent messengers to Saul’s son Ish-bosheth demanding, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for 100 Philistine foreskins.” 
2SA.3.15	So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, Paltiel son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	But her husband accompanied her, weeping as he went, and followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return!” So he returned. 
2SA.3.17	Now Abner had a word with the elders of Israel saying, “In times past you wanted David to be king over you. 
2SA.3.18	So now do it! For 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner went to Hebron to speak in the hearing of David about all that was agreeable to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin. 
2SA.3.20	When Abner came to David in Hebron along with 20 other men, David held a banquet for Abner and the men with him. 
2SA.3.21	Abner said to David, “Let me get up and go rally all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may cut a covenant with you, and you may reign over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he departed in 
2SA.3.22	Just then, David’s soldiers and Joab came from a raid, bringing with them much spoil. By then Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he departed in 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, they told Joab, saying, “Abner son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look here, Abner came to you—why did you send him away? Now he is getting away! 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner son of Ner—surely he came to deceive you, to spy on your goings and comings, and to find out all that you are doing.” 
2SA.3.26	When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, so they brought him back from the well of Sirah, though David knew nothing about it. 
2SA.3.27	Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside within the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the groin, so that he died—on account of the blood of his brother Asahel. 
2SA.3.28	When David heard about it afterward, he said, “I and my kingdom are innocent before 
2SA.3.29	May it whirl on Joab’s head and on all his father’s house. May the house of Joab never be without someone with discharge or 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in battle. 
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Rend your clothes, gird with sackcloth, and lament before Abner.” King David walked behind the platform. 
2SA.3.32	When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king lifted up his voice and wept aloud at Abner’s grave, and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	Then the king chanted a lament for Abner and said, “Should Abner die like a senseless fool? 
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound, your feet were never put in fetters. As one falls before the children of iniquity, so did you fall.” Then all the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	Then all the people came to urge David to eat some food while it was still day, but David vowed saying, “May God do so to me and even more if I taste food or anything else before the sun sets.” 
2SA.3.36	All the people took note of it and it pleased them, just as everything the king did pleased all the people. 
2SA.3.37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king’s will to kill Abner son of Ner. 
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his soldiers, “Don’t you realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel today? 
2SA.3.39	So today I am vulnerable, even though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me to handle. May 
2SA.4.1	Now when Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage sank, and all the Israelites were disturbed. 
2SA.4.2	Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of raiding bands: the name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin, 
2SA.4.3	though the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim and live there as outsiders to this day). 
2SA.4.4	(Saul’s son Jonathan had a son whose legs were crippled. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up and fled. It came about, as she was hurrying to flee, that he fell and was crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.) 
2SA.4.5	Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came to the house of Ish-bosheth at the heat of the day, as he was taking his midday nap. 
2SA.4.6	When they came within the house, as though to get wheat, they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. 
2SA.4.7	When they had gotten within the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they stabbed him and killed him, then beheaded him and took his head, and traveled by the way of the Arabah all night. 
2SA.4.8	Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, “Here is the head of Saul’s son Ish-bosheth, your enemy, who sought your life. Today 
2SA.4.9	Then David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, saying to them, “As 
2SA.4.10	when someone informed me saying, ‘Look, Saul is dead!’ thinking he was a bearer of good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, instead of rewarding him for his news. 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house and on his bed! Should I not now require his blood from your hands and rid the earth of you?” 
2SA.4.12	Then David commanded the young men, and they slew them, cut off their hands and their legs, and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke saying, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood. 
2SA.5.2	Even before, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out and back. Also 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David cut a covenant with them at Hebron before 
2SA.5.4	David was 30 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 40 years. 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned 33 years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	Now the king and his soldiers marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the region. But they said to David, “You’ll never get in here! Even the blind and the lame could ward you off,” thinking, “David can’t get in here.” 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless, David did capture the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David). 
2SA.5.8	On that day David said, “Whoever would conquer the Jebusites must strike through the water shaft to those ‘lame and blind’ whom David’s soul despises.” That is why they used to say, “The blind or lame couldn’t get into the house.” 
2SA.5.9	So David ­occupied the stronghold and renamed it the City of David. Then David fortified it all round from the Millo inward. 
2SA.5.10	David continued to grow stronger, for 
2SA.5.11	Then King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David with cedar logs, carpenters and masons; and they built a palace for David. 
2SA.5.12	David then realized that 
2SA.5.13	Then David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David. 
2SA.5.14	Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	Now when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines marched up searching for David. When David heard about it, he went down to the stronghold. 
2SA.5.18	The Philistines came and spread out in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	Then David inquired of 
2SA.5.20	So David came to Baal-perazim and David struck them down there. So he said, “
2SA.5.21	They abandoned their idols there, so David and his men removed them. 
2SA.5.22	But the Philistines marched up and spread out in the valley of Rephaim again. 
2SA.5.23	When David inquired of 
2SA.5.24	Now it will be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you must act, for then 
2SA.5.25	David did just as 
2SA.6.1	Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, 30,000. 
2SA.6.2	Then David and all the people who were with him arose and set out from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the very Name of 
2SA.6.3	So they loaded the ark of God on a new cart and carried it out of the house of Abinadab that was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, drove the new cart 
2SA.6.4	as they brought it from the house of Abinadab (which was on the hill) with the ark of God, and Ahio was walking in front of the ark. 
2SA.6.5	Meanwhile David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating before 
2SA.6.6	But when they reached the threshing floor of Nahon, Uzzah reached out to the ark of God and grasped it, for the oxen had stumbled. 
2SA.6.7	Then the anger of 
2SA.6.8	David was upset because of 
2SA.6.9	So David was frightened of 
2SA.6.10	David was unwilling to move the ark of 
2SA.6.11	So the ark of 
2SA.6.12	Then it was reported to King David saying, “
2SA.6.13	Now when the bearers of the ark of 
2SA.6.14	Meanwhile, David was dancing before 
2SA.6.15	So David and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of 
2SA.6.16	But as the ark of 
2SA.6.17	They brought in the ark of 
2SA.6.18	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of 
2SA.6.19	Then he distributed to all the people—to the whole multitude of Israel, men and women alike—to everyone a loaf of bread, a cake made in a pan and a raisin cake. Then all the people departed, each to his home. 
2SA.6.20	David returned to bless his own household. But Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel distinguished himself today, when he uncovered himself today in the eyes of the slave girls of his subjects, as any vulgar fellow would shamelessly uncover himself!” 
2SA.6.21	“It was before 
2SA.6.22	and will dishonor myself even more than this, and will be low in my own eyes. Yet in the eyes of the slave girls whom you mentioned, I will be honored.” 
2SA.6.23	So Saul’s daughter Michal had no children to the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	Now it came about when the king lived in his palace and 
2SA.7.2	that the king said to the prophet Nathan, “See now, I am living in a house of cedar, yet the ark of God remains within curtains.” 
2SA.7.3	“Go, do all that is in your heart,” Nathan said to the king, “for 
2SA.7.4	But it came to pass the same night that the word of 
2SA.7.5	“Go, tell My servant David: Thus says 
2SA.7.6	Since the day that I brought up the children of Israel from Egypt to this day I have not dwelt in a house, but have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle. 
2SA.7.7	In all My journeying among all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ 
2SA.7.8	So now, thus you shall say to My servant David: Thus says 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make your name as great as the greatest on earth. 
2SA.7.10	I will also set up a place for My people Israel and will plant them, so they may dwell in their own place and not be disturbed again. Nor will the children of wickedness afflict them anymore as in the past, 
2SA.7.11	since the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. So I will give you rest from all your enemies. “Moreover, 
2SA.7.12	When your days are done and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed, who will come forth from you after you, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He will build a house for My Name, and I will establish his royal throne forever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to Me. If he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and with the strokes from sons of men. 
2SA.7.15	Yet My lovingkindness will not be withdrawn from him as I withdrew it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 
2SA.7.16	So your house and your kingship will be secure forever before you; your throne will be established forever.” 
2SA.7.17	Just so Nathan spoke all these words and all this vision to David. 
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat before 
2SA.7.19	Yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, my Lord 
2SA.7.20	What more can David add in speaking to You? For You already know Your servant, my Lord 
2SA.7.21	For the sake of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have done everything great, revealing this to Your servant. 
2SA.7.22	Therefore You are great, my Lord 
2SA.7.23	What one nation on earth is like Your people, like Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a Name, to do for You a great thing and awesome deeds for Your land, before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt—driving out nations and their gods? 
2SA.7.24	So You established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your very own people forever, and You, 
2SA.7.25	“So now, my Lord 
2SA.7.26	Let Your Name be magnified forever by saying, ‘
2SA.7.27	For You, 
2SA.7.28	So now, my Lord 
2SA.7.29	So now let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, to continue forever before You. For You, my Lord 
2SA.8.1	Now afterward David attacked the Philistines and subdued them, and took Metheg-ammah from the hand of the Philistines. 
2SA.8.2	He also defeated Moab. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them with a cord. Every two measures of them were put to death, and the third measure was kept alive. So the Moabites became vassals to David, bringing tribute. 
2SA.8.3	David also defeated King Hadadezer son of Rehob of Zobah, as he went to restore his dominion along the River. 
2SA.8.4	David captured from him 1700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers, and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, while reserving 100 of them for chariots. 
2SA.8.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to the aid of King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 Aramean men. 
2SA.8.6	Then David stationed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became vassals to David, bringing tribute. So 
2SA.8.7	David also took the golden shields of Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	From Betah and Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a vast amount of bronze. 
2SA.8.9	Now when King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	Toi sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer—for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver, gold and bronze. 
2SA.8.11	These too King David consecrated to 
2SA.8.12	from Aram, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 
2SA.8.13	Then David made a name for himself when he returned from striking 18,000 down from Edom in the Valley of Salt. 
2SA.8.14	Then he stationed garrisons in Edom. Throughout all Edom he stationed garrisons, so that all the Edomites became vassals to David. So 
2SA.8.15	David reigned over all Israel, and David executed justice and righteousness for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab son of Zeruiah was commander over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; 
2SA.8.17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David’s sons were chief ministers. 
2SA.9.1	Then David inquired, “Is there anyone still left from the house of Saul, so that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 
2SA.9.2	Now there was a servant from Saul’s house whose name was Ziba, so they summoned him to David. The king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” “Your servant,” he said. 
2SA.9.3	The king asked him, “Is there still anyone from the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?” “There is still a son of Jonathan,” Ziba said to the king, “with crippled legs.” 
2SA.9.4	“Where is he?” the king said to him. Ziba said to the king, “He’s there, in the house of Machir son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.” 
2SA.9.5	So King David sent word and brought him from the house of Machir son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 
2SA.9.6	Then Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan son of Saul, came to David, fell on his face and prostrated himself. “Mephibosheth!” David said. “Behold your servant!” he answered. “Don’t be afraid,” 
2SA.9.7	David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat bread at my table.” 
2SA.9.8	Then he bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should turn to look at such a dead dog like me?” 
2SA.9.9	Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his household I have given to your master’s son. 
2SA.9.10	So you, you and your sons and your servants will till the land for him, and you will bring in the yield so that your master’s son may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master’s son will always eat bread at my table.” Now Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants. 
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do.” Thus Mephibosheth used to eat at the table just like one of the king’s sons. 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All the members of Ziba’s household were servants to Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	But Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate at the king’s table regularly, though he was crippled in both his legs.
2SA.10.1	It came about after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son Hanun reigned in his place. 
2SA.10.2	Then David thought, “Let me show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent word by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived at the land of the children of Ammon, 
2SA.10.3	the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David is really honoring your father because he has sent consolers to you? Has not David sent his servants to you in order to explore the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun seized David’s servants, shaved off one side of their beards, cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When they informed David, he sent word to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow, then return.” 
2SA.10.6	Now when the children of Ammon saw that they had become a stench to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-Rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, plus 12,000 men from Tob. 
2SA.10.7	When David heard about it, he sent Joab and the whole army—the mighty warriors. 
2SA.10.8	The children of Ammon came out and lined up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field. 
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that there was a battle line against him front and rear, he chose of all the best troops of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans, 
2SA.10.10	but the rest of the troops he committed to the command of his brother Abishai, and he arrayed them against the children of Ammon. 
2SA.10.11	Then he said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you will help me, but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you. 
2SA.10.12	! And let us take courage for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God, and may 
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the troops with him advanced to battle against the Arameans—and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and withdrew into the city. Then Joab returned from assaulting the children of Ammon, and went to Jerusalem. 
2SA.10.15	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer sent word and brought out the Arameans from across the River, and they came to Helam, with Hadadezer’s army commander Shobach before them. 
2SA.10.17	When David was told, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans arrayed their lines against David and fought him. 
2SA.10.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel—David killed 700 charioteers of the Arameans and 40,000 horsemen, and struck down Shobach the commander of their army, so he died there. 
2SA.10.19	When the vassal kings of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became servants to them. Then the Arameans were afraid to help the children of Ammon anymore. 
2SA.11.1	Now it came to pass at the turn of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his officials with him and all Israel, and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem. 
2SA.11.2	One evening David rose from his bed and strolled on the roof of the royal palace. Then from the roof he saw a woman washing—a very beautiful woman. 
2SA.11.3	So David sent someone to inquire about the woman, and he reported, “Isn’t this Bath-sheba, daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 
2SA.11.4	Then David sent messengers and took her when she came to him, and he lay with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness). Then she returned to her house. 
2SA.11.5	The woman conceived and sent word to David saying, “I’m pregnant.” 
2SA.11.6	So David sent a message to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the troops fared, and how the war was going. 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” When Uriah left the royal palace, a present from the king followed him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the royal palace with all his master’s servants, and did not go down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	When they informed David saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?” 
2SA.11.11	But Uriah answered David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my lord Joab and the officers of my lord are camping in the open field. Should I then go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As you live and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.” 
2SA.11.12	Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will send you off.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day. The next day, 
2SA.11.13	David called him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk. But in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his master’s servants, but did not go down to his house. 
2SA.11.14	So in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah’s hand. 
2SA.11.15	In the letter he wrote, “Put Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and withdraw from him so that he may be struck down and die.” 
2SA.11.16	So it came to pass, when Joab was besieging the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were. 
2SA.11.17	Then the men of the city came out and attacked Joab, and some of the troops of David’s officers fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died. 
2SA.11.18	When Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war, 
2SA.11.19	he charged the messenger saying, “When you finish reporting all the events of the war to the king, 
2SA.11.20	if it happens that the king’s wrath flares up and he says to you, ‘Why did you come so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who killed Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you come so close to the wall?’ Then you will say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead, too.’” 
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to report. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the open field, but we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	Then the archers shot at your troops from the wall, and some of the king’s officers fell dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite died, too.” 
2SA.11.25	Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Don’t let this matter upset you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Press your attack against the city and overthrow it!’ So tell him, 
2SA.11.26	Now when the wife of Uriah heard that her husband Uriah had died, she mourned over her husband. 
2SA.11.27	When the time of mourning was over, David sent someone who brought her to his palace. So she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done was evil in 
2SA.12.1	Then 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had an exceedingly huge flock and herd, 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing at all, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished, and it grew up together with him and his children. It ate from his own morsel and drank from his own cup, and nestled in his bosom, and it was to him like a daughter. 
2SA.12.4	Now a traveler came to the rich man, but he was unwilling to take one from his own flock or herd to prepare a meal for the wayfarer who had come to him. Rather, he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man that had come to him.” 
2SA.12.5	Then David’s anger blazed hot against the man and he said to Nathan, “As 
2SA.12.6	So he must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because he did such a thing and showed no pity.” 
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says 
2SA.12.8	I also gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your bosom, and I gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. Now if that were too little, then I would have added to you so much more. 
2SA.12.9	Why then have you despised the word of 
2SA.12.10	So now the sword will never depart from your house—because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife. 
2SA.12.11	“Thus says 
2SA.12.12	Indeed you have done it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and under the sun.” 
2SA.12.13	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against 
2SA.12.14	However, because by this deed you have made the enemies of 
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went to his house. Then 
2SA.12.16	David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night on the floor. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of his household stood beside him in order to get him up from the floor but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them. 
2SA.12.18	Then it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died. But David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, “Behold, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he didn’t listen to our voice. So how can we tell him that the child is dead? He might do something terrible!” 
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead. So David asked his servants, “Is the child dead?” “He is dead,” they said. 
2SA.12.20	Then David got up from the floor, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes. Then he went to the House of 
2SA.12.21	His servants asked him, “What is this thing you have done? You fasted and wept while the child was still alive, but as soon as the child died, you got up and ate food.” 
2SA.12.22	He replied, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept, for I thought, ‘Who knows? 
2SA.12.23	But now that he has died, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? It is I who will be going to him, but he will never return to me.” 
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to her and lay with her, and she bore a son and called his name Solomon. 
2SA.12.25	and He sent word by the hand of the prophet Nathan. So he called his name Jedidiah, for 
2SA.12.26	Now Joab attacked Rabbah of the children of Ammon and captured the royal city. 
2SA.12.27	So Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have attacked Rabbah and captured the city’s water supply. 
2SA.12.28	So now gather the rest of the troops together, camp against the city and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all the troops, went to Rabbah, attacked it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	Then he took the crown of their king from off his head—its weight was a talent of gold and in it was a precious stone—and then it was placed on David’s head. He also brought a vast amount of spoils out of the city. 
2SA.12.31	Then he brought out the people who were there and put them to work under saws, iron threshing boards and iron axes, and assigned them to brick making; and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	It came to pass after this that Absalom son of David had a beautiful sister named Tamar, so Amnon, son of David, fell in love with her. 
2SA.13.2	But Amnon was so frustrated that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible in Amnon to do anything to her. 
2SA.13.3	However, Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, and Jonadab was a very shrewd man. 
2SA.13.4	So he said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, so miserable morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon told him, “I’m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.” 
2SA.13.5	So Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you are sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me some bread to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may see it and eat from her hand.’” 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in front of me so I may eat from her hand.” 
2SA.13.7	Then David sent someone to the house for Tamar saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house and prepare bread for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house while he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in front of him and baked the cakes. 
2SA.13.9	Then she took the pan and poured them out in front of him but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Everyone, leave me!” So everyone left him. 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the bread into the bedroom that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon. 
2SA.13.11	But when she brought them close to him to eat, he grabbed her and said to her, “Come lie with me, my sister.” 
2SA.13.12	“No!” she said to him. “Don’t, my brother! Don’t rape me, for such a thing should never be done in Israel. Don’t do this disgraceful deed! 
2SA.13.13	I—where could I go with my shame? You—you will be as one of the disgraceful fools in Israel. Now, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” 
2SA.13.14	But he was unwilling to listen to her voice, so he overpowered her, forced her and lay with her. 
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon loathed her with very intense revulsion—indeed, the hatred that he hated her with was greater than the love in which he had loved her. So Amnon said to her, “Get up, get out!” 
2SA.13.16	But she said to him, “No! Sending me away is even a greater evil than the one you have already done to me!” But again he would not listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant that attended him and said, “Get this woman away from me now and bolt the door after her.” 
2SA.13.18	Now she had on her a long-sleeved garment for with such robes the king’s virgin daughters used to be dressed. When his attendant took her outside and bolted the door after her, 
2SA.13.19	Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her long-sleeved garment that was on her. She laid her hand on her head and was crying aloud as she went away. 
2SA.13.20	Then her brother Absalom said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? So now, my sister, keep quiet. He is your brother—don’t take this thing to heart.” But Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house. 
2SA.13.21	When King David heard about all these things, he was very angry. 
2SA.13.22	Absalom did not say a word to Amnon, either good or bad, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had raped his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.23	It came about, after two full years, that Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 
2SA.13.24	Then Absalom came to the king and said, “See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants come with your servant.” 
2SA.13.25	But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son. Let’s not all go—we don’t want to be burdensome to you.” Though he urged him, he would not go, though he blessed him. 
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, then please let my brother Amnon go with us.” “Why should he go with you?” the king said to him. 
2SA.13.27	But when Absalom pressed him, he let Amnon go with him, along with all the king’s sons. 
2SA.13.28	Then Absalom commanded his young men saying, “Now watch Amnon until his heart is merry with wine. When I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon!’ then put him to death! Have no fear! Isn’t it I who commanded you? Be strong! Be sons of valor!” 
2SA.13.29	So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon as Absalom had ordered. Then all the king’s sons got up, each mounted his mule and fled. 
2SA.13.30	While they were on the way, a report came to David saying, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons and not one of them is left!” 
2SA.13.31	Then the king stood up, rent his clothes and lay on the ground, and all his courtiers were standing by with their clothes rent. 
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab son of David’s brother Shimeah said in response, “My lord must not think that they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons! For only Amnon has died. For from Absalom’s mouth this has been determined since the day he raped his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore, my lord the king must not take the report to his heart thinking that all the king’s sons are dead—for only Amnon is dead.” 
2SA.13.34	Meanwhile Absalom had fled. When the young watchman lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, there were many people coming down the road behind him on the hillside. 
2SA.13.35	Then Jonadab said to the king, “The king’s sons have just arrived! It’s just as your servant has said.” 
2SA.13.36	As soon as he finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons arrived. They lifted up their voices and wept, and also the king and all his courtiers wept very bitterly. 
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day. 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled, went to Geshur and remained there three years. 
2SA.13.39	Then King David’s soul longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.
2SA.14.1	Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was on Absalom.
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent word to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there. He said to her, “Please pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning clothes. Do not anoint yourself with oil but be like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead. 
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king and speak to him these words.” Then Joab put the words in her mouth. 
2SA.14.4	When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, bowed down and said, “Help, O king!” 
2SA.14.5	“What’s the matter with you?” the king said to her. “Truly, I am a widow, my husband is dead,” she said. 
2SA.14.6	“Your handmaid had two sons, but the two of them fought with each other in the field, where there was no one to separate them. So one struck the other and killed him. 
2SA.14.7	Now behold, the whole clan has risen against your handmaid and said, ‘Hand over the one who struck down his brother so we may put him to death, for the life of his brother whom he slew.’ So they will also destroy the heir and extinguish my one remaining ember, leaving to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth!” 
2SA.14.8	Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your home. I will issue an order concerning you.” 
2SA.14.9	The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord the king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father’s house but may the king and his throne be innocent.” 
2SA.14.10	“Whoever speaks to you,” the king said, “bring him to me and he shall not touch you anymore.” 
2SA.14.11	“Please, let the king remember 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Please, let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.” “Say on,” he said. 
2SA.14.13	The woman said, “Why have you devised a situation just like this against God’s people? For by speaking this word, the king is like the guilty one—by not bringing back the one he banished. 
2SA.14.14	For we will all surely die and be like water spilt on the ground that cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life but rather, He devises plans so that a banished person may not remain an outcast from Him. 
2SA.14.15	Now the reason I came to speak this word to my lord the king is because the people have made me afraid. So your handmaid thought, ‘I must speak to the king—perhaps the king will fulfill the request of his maidservant. 
2SA.14.16	Surely the king will hear, to deliver his maidservant from the hand of the one who would eliminate both me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.’ 
2SA.14.17	Then your handmaid also thought, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring relief. For like an angel of God so is my lord the king to discern good and evil.’ So may 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything from me concerning what I am about to ask you.” “Please let my lord the king speak,” the woman said. 
2SA.14.19	Then the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” “As your soul lives, my lord the king,” the woman answered, “no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Yes, your servant Joab was the one who commanded me and put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid. 
2SA.14.20	Your servant Joab did this thing in order to bring about a change in the situation. But my lord is wise—like the wisdom of an angel of God—to know all that goes on in the land.” 
2SA.14.21	Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will do this thing. So go, bring the young man Absalom back.” 
2SA.14.22	Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself and blessed the king. Then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, since the king has done the word of your servant.” 
2SA.14.23	So Joab got up, went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	However, the king said, “He may go directly to his own house, but he may not see my face.” So Absalom went directly to his own house and did not see the king’s face. 
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel there was none as handsome as Absalom—so highly praised. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
2SA.14.26	When he cut the hair of his head—at the end of every year he would cut it because the hair got so heavy on him that he had to cut it. The weight of the hair from his head was 200 shekels by the royal weight. 
2SA.14.27	To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar—she was a beautiful woman. 
2SA.14.28	Now Absalom had lived two full years in Jerusalem but he never saw the king’s face. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab, in order to send him to the king, but he was unwilling to come to him. So he sent word again a second time, but he still would not come. 
2SA.14.30	So he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is next to mine and he has barley there—go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. 
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose, came to Absalom at his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?” 
2SA.14.32	“Look, I sent word to you,” Absalom said to Joab, “saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.’” So now, let me see the king’s face and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.” 
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to the king and told him. When he summoned Absalom, he came to the king and bowed down on his face to the ground before the king, and then, the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	Now it came about after this that Absalom provided himself with a chariot, horses and 50 men as runners before him.
2SA.15.2	Absalom used to rise up early and stand beside the road to the city gate. Whenever anyone had a suit to come to the king for justice, then Absalom would call to him and say, “What town are you from?” Should he answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,” 
2SA.15.3	Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but there is no one assigned to you by the king to hear you.” 
2SA.15.4	Moreover, Absalom would say, “If only I were appointed judge in the land, then every man who has any suit or case would come to me, and I would get him justice!” 
2SA.15.5	Also, whenever anyone approached to bow to him, he would stretch his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	So Absalom kept doing this to everyone of Israel who came to the king for judgment. Thus Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel. 
2SA.15.7	At the end of 40 years Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron and pay my vow which I have vowed to 
2SA.15.8	For your servant vowed a vow while I was still living at Geshur in Aram saying, ‘If 
2SA.15.9	So the king said to him, “Go in 
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies to all the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the 
2SA.15.11	Now 200 men from Jerusalem went with Absalom, who were invited and were going innocently, knowing nothing of the situation. 
2SA.15.12	Also Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor from his town Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. So the conspiracy gained momentum for the people following Absalom continued to increase. 
2SA.15.13	Then a messenger came to David saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are following Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee, or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Leave in haste or else he will overtake us quickly and bring disaster down on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.” 
2SA.15.15	Then the king’s officials said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses.” 
2SA.15.16	So the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But the king left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace. 
2SA.15.17	As the king went out and all the people after him, they paused at the last house. 
2SA.15.18	All his servants passed on beside him: all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites and all the Gittites—600 men that had come after him from Gath—passed on before the king. 
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place. 
2SA.15.20	Your arrival was only yesterday—should I make you wander around with us today, to go wherever I may go? Go back and take your kinsmen back with you. Kindness and truth be with you!” 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered the king and said, “As 
2SA.15.22	So David said to Ittai, “Go on and cross over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed on, with all his men and all the little children who were with him. 
2SA.15.23	While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people were crossing over as the king was crossing over Kidron Valley. So all the people crossed over toward the road of the wilderness. 
2SA.15.24	Then behold, Zadok also came and all the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, then Abiathar came up, until all the people had passed by, out of the city. 
2SA.15.25	But the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in 
2SA.15.26	But if He says thus, ‘I have no delight in you,’ here I am, let Him do to me as seems good in His eyes.” 
2SA.15.27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Do you not see? Return to the city in 
2SA.15.28	See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.” 
2SA.15.29	Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there. 
2SA.15.30	Then David continued to go up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he ascended. He had his head covered and was walking barefoot. So all the people with him each covered his head as they went up, weeping as they ascended. 
2SA.15.31	Then someone told David saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David prayed, “
2SA.15.32	Then David went on until he reached the summit—where God was worshiped—and behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat rent and dust on his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you pass on with me then you will be a burden to me, 
2SA.15.34	but if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king—I was your father’s servant from then, but now I will be your servant,’ then you can thwart Ahithophel’s counsel for me. 
2SA.15.35	Won’t you have with you Zadok and Abiathar the 
2SA.15.36	See, they have their two sons with them there, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar’s son Jonathan—by them you can send to me everything you hear.” 
2SA.15.37	So David’s friend Hushai reached the city just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem. 
2SA.16.1	Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit, there was Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth to meet him with a pair of saddled donkeys, and on them 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 fig cakes and a bottle of wine. 
2SA.16.2	So the king asked Ziba, “What are you doing with these?” Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and the figs are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone who faints in the wilderness to drink.” 
2SA.16.3	Then the king asked, “And where is your master’s son?” “Well, he’s staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba said to the king, “for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my father.” 
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” “I bow low,” Ziba said. “Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.” 
2SA.16.5	When King David arrived at Bahurim, behold, just coming out from there was a man of the family of the house of Saul—his name was Shimei son of Gera. As he came out, he kept on cursing 
2SA.16.6	and flinging stones at David and at all King David’s servants, while all the people and all the mighty men were at his right hand and on his left. 
2SA.16.7	Thus Shimei said as he cursed, “Get out, get out! The man of bloodshed, the good-for-nothing! 
2SA.16.8	 has returned on you all the blood of Saul’s house, in whose place you’ve reigned. 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why let this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now and take off his head!” 
2SA.16.10	But the king said, “What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, it’s because 
2SA.16.11	Then David said to Abishai and to all his officials, “Look, my son who came from my own body is seeking my life—how much more this Benjamite? Leave him alone and let him curse, since 
2SA.16.12	Perhaps 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men continued on the way, while Shimei kept walking alongside the hill parallel with him, cursing as he walked, casting stones at him and throwing dirt. 
2SA.16.14	Finally the king and all the people that were with him arrived weary, so he refreshed himself there.
2SA.16.15	Meanwhile Absalom and all the people of the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem. Ahithophel was with him. 
2SA.16.16	Now when David’s friend Hushai the Archite came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” 
2SA.16.17	But Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 
2SA.16.18	“No!” said Hushai to Absalom. “For the one whom 
2SA.16.19	Besides, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I be in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence.” 
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel. What should we do?” 
2SA.16.21	So Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go to your father’s concubines whom he has left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself abhorrent to your father and the hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened.” 
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was like inquiring for the word of God—so was all of Ahithophel’s counsel both with David and with Absalom.
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose 12,000 men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will attack him while he is weary and weak-handed, and terrify him so that all the people that are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king when he is alone. 
2SA.17.3	Then I will bring all the people back to you—when all will have returned except the man you are seeking, then all the people will be at peace.” 
2SA.17.4	Now the plan seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel. 
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Call now Hushai the Archite also. Let’s hear what he has to say as well.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him saying, “This is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his counsel? If not, you will speak.” 
2SA.17.7	So Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good.” 
2SA.17.8	Hushai then added, “You know your father and his men. They are mighty men, and they are embittered in their souls like a bear robbed of her cubs in the wild. Your father is an expert in warfare, and won’t spend the night with the troops. 
2SA.17.9	Even now, he must be hiding in one of the caves or in some other place. So if he were to fall on them at first, whoever hears of it would say, ‘There’s a slaughter among the people following Absalom!’ 
2SA.17.10	Then even one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt away—for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty warrior and those who are with him are valiant men. 
2SA.17.11	Instead, I counsel that all Israel be gathered altogether to you—from Dan to Beersheba, as abundant as the sand by the sea—and that you personally go into the battle. 
2SA.17.12	Then we will come upon him in one of the places where he can be found and we’ll fall upon him as dew falls on the ground. None will be left of all the men who are with him—not even one. 
2SA.17.13	Moreover if he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and drag it into the valley until not even one small stone will be found there.” 
2SA.17.14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send word quickly and tell David saying, ‘Don’t spend the night at the fords in the wilderness but by all means, cross over or else the king and all the people with him may be swallowed up.’” 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a maidservant used to go and pass information along to them. Then they would go and inform King David for they could not be seen entering the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a lad did see them and informed Absalom. So the two of them left quickly and arrived at the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard; so they went down into it. 
2SA.17.19	Then the woman took the cover and spread it over the well’s mouth and scattered grain on top of it so that nothing was noticeable. 
2SA.17.20	When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” the woman said to them, “They crossed over the brook of water.” When they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. 
2SA.17.21	After they had departed, they came up from the well, then went and informed King David, telling David, “Get up and cross over the water immediately, for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.” 
2SA.17.22	Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed over the Jordan. By morning light, not even one of them was left who had not crossed the Jordan. 
2SA.17.23	Now when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, went to his home in his hometown set his house in order, and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb. 
2SA.17.24	David had reached Mahanaim by the time Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. (Now Amasa was son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had gone to Abigal daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother.) 
2SA.17.26	Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 
2SA.17.27	Now when David reached Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-debar and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, basins, clay pots, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds, 
2SA.17.29	honey, curd, sheep and cheese from the herd for David and for the people who were with him to eat. For they said, “The people must be hungry, weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”
2SA.18.1	Then David mustered the people who were with him and set commanders of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
2SA.18.2	Then David sent out the troops, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, “I must certainly go out with you also.” 
2SA.18.3	But the troops said, “You must not go out! For if we were to flee, they would not care about us, even if half of us die, they still wouldn’t care about us—but you are worth 10,000 of us. Therefore now, it is better that you be ready to support us from the city.” 
2SA.18.4	Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate and all the troops went out by their hundreds and thousands. 
2SA.18.5	Then the king charged Joab, Abishai and Ittai saying, “Deal gently with the young man Absalom for my sake.” Now all the troops heard the king’s charge to all the commanders concerning Absalom. 
2SA.18.6	Then the troops went out to the field to confront Israel but the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	The people of Israel were defeated there before the followers of David, and the slaughter that day was great—20,000 men. 
2SA.18.8	For the battle there was spread over the face of the entire countryside and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. 
2SA.18.9	Now Absalom encountered some of David’s servants. When Absalom was riding on his mule, the mule went under the thick branches of the great oak, and his head got caught in the oak, so that he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on. 
2SA.18.10	Then a certain man saw it and told Joab saying, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.” 
2SA.18.11	Then Joab said to his informant, “Look here, you saw him, so why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt!” 
2SA.18.12	But the man said to Joab, “Even if I had 1,000 pieces of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged you, Abishai and Ittai saying, ‘Watch over the young man Absalom for me.’ 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise, I would have betrayed his soul—and nothing stays hidden from the king—and you yourself would have stood aloof.” 
2SA.18.14	“I won’t wait for you!” Joab said. So he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
2SA.18.15	Then ten young men who were Joab’s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck and finished him off. 
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom and threw him into a deep pit in the forest and piled over him a very large heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his tent. 
2SA.18.18	(Now Absalom, in his lifetime, had taken and set up for himself a pillar, which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he called the pillar by his name and it has been called Absalom’s Monument to this day.) 
2SA.18.19	Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Let me now run and bring the king news that 
2SA.18.20	But Joab said to him, “You are not to be the bearer of news today. You may do it another day, but today you shall bear no news—for the king’s son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running. 
2SA.18.22	But Ahimaaz son of Zadok once again said to Joab, “Whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” “Why should you run, my son,” Joab said, “since you would have no news worth telling?” 
2SA.18.23	“Whatever may come of it, I want to run!” So he said to him, “Run!” Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and so passed the Cushite. 
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the two gates. When the watchman on the roof over the gate walked over to the wall, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and all of a sudden, he saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	The watchman cried out and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is good news in his mouth.” So he came closer and closer. 
2SA.18.26	Then the watchman saw another man running, so the watchman called out to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, another man is running alone.” The king said, “He too is bringing good news.” 
2SA.18.27	Then the watchman said, “I can see that the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” “This is a good man and he comes with good news,” the king replied. 
2SA.18.28	Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “
2SA.18.29	Then the king asked, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “I saw a great tumult when the king’s servant Joab sent me, your servant, but I did not know what it was about.” 
2SA.18.30	“Step aside and stand here,” the king said. So he stepped aside and stood still. 
2SA.18.31	Then the Cushite arrived and said, “Let my lord the king receive good news for 
2SA.18.32	Then the king asked the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “Let the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be as that young man!”
2SA.19.1	The king was shaken. So he went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. As he walked he cried, “My son Absalom! O my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! Absalom, my son, my son!” 
2SA.19.2	Then Joab was told, “Look, the king is weeping and mourning over Absalom!” 
2SA.19.3	So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the troops, for the troops heard it said that day, “The king is grieving over his son.” 
2SA.19.4	So the troops entered into the city stealthily that day, like troops who are ashamed after running away in battle. 
2SA.19.5	The king covered his face and cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!” 
2SA.19.6	Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your servants—who this day have saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, and the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines—
2SA.19.7	by loving those who hate you, and hating those who love you! For you have shown today that officers and officials are nothing to you. For today I realize that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, then it would have pleased you well. 
2SA.19.8	So now arise, go out, and speak to the heart of your servants! For I swear by 
2SA.19.9	So the king arose and sat in the gate. When they told all the troops saying, “See, the king is sitting at the gate,” all the troops presented themselves before the king. Meanwhile, Israel had fled each man to his tent. 
2SA.19.10	All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were at strife saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and he saved us from the hand of the Philistines. Yet now he had to flee from the land because of Absalom, 
2SA.19.11	but Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why are we silent about restoring the king?” 
2SA.19.12	Then King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the 
2SA.19.13	‘You are my kinsmen, my bone and my flesh! Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.14	“Also say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me and even more if you do not become my army commander before me continually, in place of Joab!’” 
2SA.19.15	Thus he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and then they sent word to the king, “Come back, you and all your servants.” 
2SA.19.16	So the king returned and reached the Jordan. Meanwhile, Judah came to Gilgal in order to meet the king, to escort the king over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.17	Then Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David 
2SA.19.18	accompanied by 1,000 men of Benjamin. Also Ziba the servant of Saul’s household, with his 15 sons and 20 slaves, rushed to the Jordan ahead of the king. 
2SA.19.19	They ferried across the ford to bring the king’s household and they did whatever seemed good in his eyes. Now, Shimei son of Gera fell down before the king when he was crossing over the Jordan, 
2SA.19.20	so he implored the king, “Let my lord not hold me guilty, and not remember the iniquity that your servant committed on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Let the king not take it to his heart. 
2SA.19.21	For your servant knows that I have sinned. So behold, I have come today the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.” 
2SA.19.22	But Abishai son of Zeruiah answered and said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed 
2SA.19.23	But David said, “What have I to do with you sons of Zeruiah that you should be my adversary today? Should any man be put to death in Israel this day? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?” 
2SA.19.24	Then the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die,” and the king swore it to him. 
2SA.19.25	Then Mephibosheth son of Saul came down to meet the king. Now he had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came home in 
2SA.19.26	Now it came to pass when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why did you not go with me Mephibosheth?” 
2SA.19.27	“My lord the king, my own servant deceived me,” he answered. “For your servant had said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, ride on it and go with the king,’ because your servant is lame. 
2SA.19.28	However, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God. So do what is good in your eyes. 
2SA.19.29	For all my father’s household deserved only death at the hand of my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those eating at your own table! What right do I have yet to cry to the king?” 
2SA.19.30	Then the king said to him, “Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decreed, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’” 
2SA.19.31	“So let him take all,” Mephibosheth replied to the king, “as long as my lord the king has come back to his own home in 
2SA.19.32	Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and he approached the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.33	Now Barzillai was a very aged man—80 years old—and he had provided for the king during his residence at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 
2SA.19.34	The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.” 
2SA.19.35	But Barzillai said to the king, “How many years are left of my life that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.36	I am now 80 years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I listen any more to the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.37	Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. But why should the king reward me with such a reward? 
2SA.19.38	Please let your servant go back, and let me die in my own hometown, near the grave of my father and my mother. But look, here is your servant Chimham—let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good in your eyes.” 
2SA.19.39	The king answered, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good in your eyes. Whatever you ask of me, I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.40	When all the people had crossed over the Jordan and as the king was about to cross over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, so he returned to his own place. 
2SA.19.41	Then the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Chimham and all the people of Judah crossed over with him, and also half the people of Israel escorted the king over. 
2SA.19.42	Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal you away by escorting the king and his household over the Jordan, along with all David’s men that were with him?” 
2SA.19.43	Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is our close relative. So why are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? Or has he given us any gifts?” 
2SA.19.44	Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten shares in the king, so in David we have even more than you. Why then did you despise us? Weren’t we the first to speak of restoring our king?” Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel. 
2SA.20.1	Now a worthless fellow happened to be there, a Benjamite named Sheba son of Bichri. He blew the 
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba son of Bichri, but the men of Judah kept close to their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem. 
2SA.20.3	Now when David arrived at his palace in Jerusalem, the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to take care of the palace, and put them in a guarded house. He provided for them but he did not cohabit with them. So they were confined until the day they died, living in widowhood. 
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon to me the men of Judah within three days and be here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to summon Judah but he took longer than the set time that he had allotted him. 
2SA.20.6	Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. So take your lord’s servants and pursue him lest he find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight.” 
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men went after him, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, and set out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military uniform, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his waist; and as he stepped forward, it fell out. 
2SA.20.9	Then Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you my brother?” With his right hand Joab took Amasa by the beard to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s other hand. So he stabbed him with it in the groin and poured out his entrails to the ground, and did not strike him again, for he died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	Meanwhile, one of Joab’s young men stood over Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!” 
2SA.20.12	Yet Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. So when the man saw that all the people stood still, he dragged Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him because he saw that everyone passing by him paused.  
2SA.20.13	Once he removed him from the highway, everyone passed on, following Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.14	Now he went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel and Beth-Maacah. All the Berites gathered together and indeed followed him. 
2SA.20.15	They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-Maacah and cast up a siege ramp against the city. It stood against the outer fortification and all the people with Joab battered the wall in order to topple it. 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Listen! Listen! Please tell Joab to come over here that I may speak with him.” 
2SA.20.17	When he approached her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” “I am,” he answered. Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your handmaid.” “I’m listening,” he answered. 
2SA.20.18	Then she spoke up saying, “They used to say in old time, ‘They shall surely seek counsel at Abel and that’s how they settled any dispute. 
2SA.20.19	I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. Are you seeking to destroy a mother city in Israel? Why would you devour 
2SA.20.20	Joab replied saying, “Never! Far be it from me that I would devour up or ruin. 
2SA.20.21	The matter is not so; but a fellow from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba son of Bichri his name, has lifted up his hand against King David. Give him up alone and I will withdraw from the city.” So the woman replied to Joab, “Look here, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman approached all the people wisely. So they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and threw it over to Joab. He then blew the 
2SA.20.23	Now Joab remained over all the army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; 
2SA.20.24	Adoram was over the forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
2SA.20.25	Sheba was scribe; Zadok and Abiathar were 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite also was a 
2SA.21.1	Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year, so David sought the face of 
2SA.21.2	So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of 
2SA.21.3	David asked the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? How may I make atonement so that you would bless the inheritance of 
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites said to him, “It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; nor is it our right to put any man to death in Israel.” “Whatever you say, I will do for you,” he said. 
2SA.21.5	Then they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and plotted against us to annihilate us from remaining in any of Israel’s territory, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men of his sons be given over to us and we will hang them up before 
2SA.21.7	Now the king spared Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan son of Saul, because of 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul—Armoni and Mephibosheth; also the five sons of Michal daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite, 
2SA.21.9	and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites. So they hanged them on the hill before 
2SA.21.10	Then Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it on the rock for herself, from the beginning of harvest until the rain poured on them from the sky. She did not let the birds of the sky rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
2SA.21.12	So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa. 
2SA.21.13	He had the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan brought up from there, and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged. 
2SA.21.14	So they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of his father Kish. They did all of what the king commanded. Afterward, God was moved by prayer for the land. 
2SA.21.15	Once again the Philistines made war with Israel, so David went down with his servants and fought against the Philistines. But David became weary. 
2SA.21.16	So Ishbi-benob—who was a descendant of the Raphah, whose spear weighed 300 shekels of bronze, who was girded with new armor—thought to kill David. 
2SA.21.17	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You must not go out with us to battle anymore. You must not quench the lamp of Israel!” 
2SA.21.18	Now it came to pass after this that there was war again with the Philistines at Gob, and Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, a descendant of the Rapha. 
2SA.21.19	Then there was war again with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite killed Goliath the Gittite—his spear had a shaft like a weaver’s beam. 
2SA.21.20	Once again there was war at Gath, where there was a champion that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes— a total of 24, and he also was a descendant of the Rapha. 
2SA.21.21	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of David’s brother Shimea killed him. 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the Rapha in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	David spoke to 
2SA.22.2	He said: “
2SA.22.3	My God is my rock, in Him I take refuge, my shield, my horn of salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my Savior—You save me from violence. 
2SA.22.4	I called upon 
2SA.22.5	For waves of death encompassed me. Torrents of Belial overwhelmed me. 
2SA.22.6	Cords of death entangled me. Snares of death came before me. 
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth rocked and quaked, the foundation of heaven trembled. They reeled because He was angry. 
2SA.22.9	Smoke rose from His nostrils and consuming fire from His mouth. Coals blazed from Him. 
2SA.22.10	He parted the heavens and came down, with thick darkness under His feet. 
2SA.22.11	He rode upon a 
2SA.22.12	He made darkness as a 
2SA.22.13	Out of the brilliance before Him coals of fire flamed out. 
2SA.22.14	 also thundered from heaven and Elyon gave forth His voice. 
2SA.22.15	He shot arrows and scattered them, lightning bolts, and routed them. 
2SA.22.16	Then the ravines of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were exposed by the rebuke of 
2SA.22.17	He reached down from on high and He took hold of me. He drew me out of mighty waters. 
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my powerful enemy, from those who hated me— for they were much stronger than me. 
2SA.22.19	They came against me in the day of my calamity, but 
2SA.22.20	He brought me out to a wide-open place. He rescued me since He delighted in me. 
2SA.22.21	 rewarded me for my righteousness. For the cleanness of my hands He repaid me. 
2SA.22.22	For I kept the ways of 
2SA.22.23	For all His judgments are before me. As for His rulings, I do not turn away from them. 
2SA.22.24	I also had integrity with Him, and kept myself from my sin. 
2SA.22.25	So 
2SA.22.26	With the loyal You deal loyally. With the blameless You are blameless. 
2SA.22.27	With the pure You show Yourself pure, but with the crooked You show Yourself shrewd. 
2SA.22.28	You save lowly people. But Your eyes are on the haughty— You will humble them. 
2SA.22.29	For You are my lamp, 
2SA.22.30	For with You I rush on a troop, with my God I can leap over a wall. 
2SA.22.31	As for God, His way is perfect. The word of 
2SA.22.32	For who is God, besides 
2SA.22.33	God is my strong fortress and He keeps my way blameless. 
2SA.22.34	He makes my legs like a deer and sets me on my heights. 
2SA.22.35	Who trains my hands for battle, so my arms can bend a bronze bow. 
2SA.22.36	You gave me Your shield of salvation. and Your answering has made me great. 
2SA.22.37	You broaden my steps beneath me, so my feet have not slipped. 
2SA.22.38	I pursue my enemies and destroy them. I will not return till they are consumed. 
2SA.22.39	I consumed them and crushed them till they cannot rise; yes, they fall beneath my feet. 
2SA.22.40	You girded me with strength for battle. You made those rising up against me bow down before me. 
2SA.22.41	You also made my enemies turn their backs to me. I cut off those who hate me. 
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was none to save —to 
2SA.22.43	Then I beat them as the dust of the earth, I stamped and crushed them like mud of the streets. 
2SA.22.44	You free me from strifes of my people. You kept me as head of the nations— people I did not know are serving me. 
2SA.22.45	Children of foreigners cringe before me. As soon as they hear, they obey me. 
2SA.22.46	Children of foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their hideouts. 
2SA.22.47	 lives! And blessed be my Rock! Exalted be God— the Rock of my salvation! 
2SA.22.48	God—He gives me vengeance and brings down peoples under me. 
2SA.22.49	He brings me out from my enemies. Indeed You lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man. 
2SA.22.50	Therefore I praise You among the nations, 
2SA.22.51	He is a tower of salvation to His king, He shows loyal love to His anointed— to David and to his seed, forever.
2SA.23.1	Now these are the last words of David, the utterance of David son of Jesse, the utterance of the man raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob and the sweet singer of Israel: 
2SA.23.2	“The 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel has said, the Rock of Israel has spoken to me, ‘He who rules over men righteously, he who rules in the fear of God— 
2SA.23.4	he is like the light of the morning when the sun rises, a cloudless morning of glistening as grass springs from the earth.’ 
2SA.23.5	Is it not true that my house is with God? For He made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered and secured in all things. Will He not make all my salvation and every desire come to fruition? 
2SA.23.6	But the worthless, all of them will be thrust aside like thorns, for they cannot be picked up by hand. 
2SA.23.7	But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear. They must be completely burned up with fire on the spot.”
2SA.23.8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains—he wielded his spear against 800 and slew them in one encounter. 
2SA.23.9	Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodo son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle. The men of Israel retreated, 
2SA.23.10	but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines until his hand became weary and stuck to the sword. So 
2SA.23.11	Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. Now the Philistines were assembled in formation where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it, and struck down the Philistines—so 
2SA.23.13	Once the three of the thirty chiefs went down and came to David at the cave of Adullam during the harvest, while a troop of Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	David said longingly, ‘“Who would get me water to drink from the well which is by the gate in Bethlehem?’” 
2SA.23.16	So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, took it and brought it to David. However, he would not drink it but poured it out to 
2SA.23.17	and he said, “‘Far be it from me, 
2SA.23.18	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Thirty. Once he wielded his spear against 300 and killed them—he had a reputation among the Three. 
2SA.23.19	He was the most honored of the Thirty, so he was made their commander; however, he did not become one of the Three. 
2SA.23.20	Then there was Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds. He killed the two from Ariel of Moab. Once, on a snowy day, he went down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit. 
2SA.23.21	He also killed an Egyptian—an impressive man—the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	These sort of things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, so that he had a name as famous as that of the Three mighty men. 
2SA.23.23	He was most honorable among the Thirty, but he attained not to the first Three. So David set him over his guard. 
2SA.23.24	Asahel brother of Joab was one of the Thirty, also Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 
2SA.23.27	Aviezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
2SA.23.29	Heleb son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai from the wadis of Gaash, 
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmavet the Barhumite, 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Ararite, 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai son of the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
2SA.23.35	Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
2SA.23.36	Igal son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor-bearer to Joab son of Zeruiah, 
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
2SA.23.39	and Uriah the Hittite—37 in all. 
2SA.24.1	Now the anger of 
2SA.24.2	The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, so that I may know the sum of the people.” 
2SA.24.3	But Joab said to the king, “May 
2SA.24.4	Nevertheless, the king’s command to Joab and the army generals remained firm. So Joab and the army generals went out from the king’s presence to number the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	They crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and toward Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	Then they went to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. Then they came to Dan-jaan and round about to Sidon, 
2SA.24.7	and came to the stronghold of Tyre, to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone throughout all the land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days. 
2SA.24.9	Joab reported the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: there were in Israel 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword and the men of Judah were 500,000 men. 
2SA.24.10	But David’s heart troubled him after he had numbered the people. So David prayed to 
2SA.24.11	When David rose up in the morning, the word of 
2SA.24.12	“Go and speak to David, thus says 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David and told him, saying to him, “Shall seven years of famine come on you in your land? Or will you flee from your adversary for three months while he is pursuing you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should return to Him who sent me.” 
2SA.24.14	Then David said to Gad, “I am in a great distress. Let us now fall into the hand of 
2SA.24.15	So 
2SA.24.16	When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, 
2SA.24.17	When David saw the angel that was striking down the people, he spoke to 
2SA.24.18	On that day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up, set up an altar to 
2SA.24.19	So David went up according to the word of Gad, as 
2SA.24.20	Now when Araunah looked down and saw the king and his courtiers crossing over toward him, Araunah went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 
2SA.24.21	Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to 
2SA.24.22	Then Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good in his eyes. Look here, the oxen for the burnt offering, as well as the threshing sledges and the ox yokes for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	All this Araunah gives to the king.” Araunah said further to the king, “May 
2SA.24.24	But the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy it from you at a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to 
2SA.24.25	Then David built there an altar to 
1KI.1.1	Now King David was old, advanced in years. Though they covered him with clothes, he could not keep warm. 
1KI.1.2	So his servants said to him: “Let them seek a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her attend the king and be his nurse; and let her lie by your side, so my lord the king may keep warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The girl was very beautiful. So she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king was not intimate with her. 
1KI.1.5	Now Adonijah son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: “I’ll be king!” So he prepared for himself chariots, horsemen and 50 men to run before him. 
1KI.1.6	His father had not scolded him at any time by asking: “Why have you behaved this way?” He was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom. 
1KI.1.7	So he conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the 
1KI.1.9	Then Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel, and invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants, 
1KI.1.10	but he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon. 
1KI.1.11	But Nathan spoke to Bath-sheba, Solomon’s mother, saying: “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has assumed the kingship—and our lord David doesn’t know it? 
1KI.1.12	Now come, please let me give you advice. Save your own life and the life of your son Solomon! 
1KI.1.13	Go at once to King David, and say to him: ‘My lord the king, haven’t you sworn to your handmaid, saying: “Surely your son Solomon will become king after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Then why does Adonijah reign?’ 
1KI.1.14	Behold, while you are still there talking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.” 
1KI.1.15	So Bath-sheba went to the king into the chamber. Now the king was very old, with Abishag the Shunammite serving the king. 
1KI.1.16	Bath-sheba bowed and prostrated herself to the king. The king asked, “What troubles you?” 
1KI.1.17	She said to him: “My lord, you swore by 
1KI.1.18	Yet now, behold, Adonijah reigns, though you do not know it—my lord the king. 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the 
1KI.1.20	As for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered traitors.” 
1KI.1.22	Then behold, while she was still talking with the king, the prophet Nathan came in, 
1KI.1.23	and they informed the king, saying: “Behold the prophet Nathan is here.” When he came in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	Then Nathan said: “My lord the king, did you say: ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne?’ 
1KI.1.25	For he has gone down today, slain oxen, fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, the captains of the army and Abiathar the 
1KI.1.26	But he did not invite me, your servant, Zadok the 
1KI.1.27	Was this thing done by my lord the king, without letting your servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?” 
1KI.1.28	Then King David answered and said: “Summon Bath-sheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	Then the king swore an oath: “As 
1KI.1.30	as surely as I swore to you by 
1KI.1.31	Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the ground and prostrated herself before the king, and said: “Let my lord King David live forever!” 
1KI.1.32	Then King David said: “Summon to me Zadok the 
1KI.1.33	the king said to them: “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	There let Zadok the 
1KI.1.35	Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne. For he shall be king in my place, as I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.” 
1KI.1.36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king and said: “Amen! Thus says 
1KI.1.37	As 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the 
1KI.1.39	Then Zadok the 
1KI.1.40	All the people went up after him, while the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the ground shook at their noise. 
1KI.1.41	Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it, just as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the 
1KI.1.42	While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan son of Abiathar the 
1KI.1.43	But Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah: “No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	Also the king has sent with him Zadok the 
1KI.1.45	Zadok the 
1KI.1.46	Also Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. 
1KI.1.47	Moreover, the king’s courtiers came to bless our lord King David, saying: ‘May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and his throne greater than your throne!’ Then the king bowed down on the bed. 
1KI.1.48	Furthermore the king said, ‘Blessed be 
1KI.1.49	Trembling, all the guests of Adonijah got up and each went his own way. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he arose, went, and grasped the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	 So it was reported to Solomon: “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for look, he grasped the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’” 
1KI.1.52	Then Solomon said, “If he shows himself a worthy man, then not a hair of him will fall to the ground. But if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.” 
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him: “Go to your home.”
1KI.2.1	Now when the time of David drew near to die, he charged his son Solomon, saying: 
1KI.2.2	“I—I am going the way of all the earth. So be strong and be a man. 
1KI.2.3	Keep the charge of 
1KI.2.4	so that 
1KI.2.5	“Moreover, you also know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, whom he killed, shedding the blood of war in peacetime, and putting the blood of war on his waistband and on his sandals on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	So act according to your wisdom, and let his gray hair not go down to 
1KI.2.7	But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table—for they befriended me when I fled from your brother Absalom. 
1KI.2.8	Also behold, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by 
1KI.2.9	Now don’t let him go unpunished. For you are a wise man, and you will know how to deal with him, and bring his gray hair down to 
1KI.2.10	Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. 
1KI.2.11	The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years—seven years he reigned in Hebron and 33 years he reigned in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	Then Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was established firmly. Solomon’s Throne Secured 
1KI.2.13	Later Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba, Solomon’s mother. “Is your coming in 
1KI.2.14	Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” “Speak!” she said. 
1KI.2.15	Then he said, “You know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel looked to me to be the king. However, the kingship has turned about and become my brother’s—for it was his from 
1KI.2.16	So now one petition I ask of you; do not deny me.” “Speak!” she said to him. 
1KI.2.17	Then he said, “Please, speak to King Solomon—for he won’t turn you down—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.” 
1KI.2.18	“Very well,” said Bath-sheba, “I will speak to the king for you.” 
1KI.2.19	So Bath-sheba went to King Solomon to speak to him about Adonijah. The king rose up to greet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set up for the king’s mother, and she sat at his right hand. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said: “I ask one small petition of you; do not deny.” “Ask, my mother,” the king said to her, “for I will not turn you down.” 
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.” 
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered and said to his mother: “So why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom as well—for he is my older brother—for him and for Abiathar the 
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore, as 
1KI.2.25	Then King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada. He struck him down and he died. 
1KI.2.26	Also to Abiathar the 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being 
1KI.2.28	When the news came to Joab, he fled to the Tent of 
1KI.2.29	It was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the Tent of 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah came to the Tent of 
1KI.2.31	Then the king commanded him: “Do as he has said—strike him down. Then bury him. So you will remove the blood that Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house. 
1KI.2.32	Thus 
1KI.2.33	May the guilt of their blood return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his offspring forever, but to David and his seed and his house, and his throne, may there be 
1KI.2.34	Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck him down and killed him, and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	Then the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and Zadok the 
1KI.2.36	Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and commanded him: “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and depart not from there anywhere else. 
1KI.2.37	For on the day you go out and cross over the Kidron valley, know for certain that you shall surely die—your blood shall be on your own head.” 
1KI.2.38	“The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. 
1KI.2.39	But it came about at the end of three years that two of Shimei’s servants ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. So they told Shimei, saying: “Behold, your servants are in Gath.” 
1KI.2.40	So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey and went to Gath to Achish, to look for his servants; then Shimei went and brought his servants back from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	But it was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and back. 
1KI.2.42	So the king sent someone and summoned Shimei. He said to him: “Didn’t I make you swear by 
1KI.2.43	Why then haven’t you kept the oath of 
1KI.2.44	The king added to Shimei: “You know all the evil, which your heart should acknowledge, that you did to my father David. Therefore 
1KI.2.45	But King Solomon shall be blessed and the throne of David established before 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, so that he died. Thus the kingdom was secured in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	Then Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt by marriage, taking Pharaoh’s daughter, and bringing her to the city of David, until he finished building his own house, the House of 
1KI.3.2	The people, however, were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no House built for the Name of 
1KI.3.3	Now Solomon loved 
1KI.3.4	So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Upon this very altar Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings. 
1KI.3.5	At Gibeon 
1KI.3.6	Solomon said: “You have shown my father Your servant David great lovingkindness, as he walked before You in truth, righteousness and uprightness of heart toward You. Indeed, You have kept this great lovingkindness for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today. 
1KI.3.7	So now, 
1KI.3.8	Your servant is amid Your people, whom You have chosen—a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted. 
1KI.3.9	So give Your servant a mind of understanding to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil—for who is able to judge this great people of Yours?” 
1KI.3.10	Now it was pleasing in the eyes of 
1KI.3.11	So God said to him: “Because you asked for this thing—and have not asked for yourself long life, nor asked for yourself riches, nor asked for the life of your enemies, but asked for yourself understanding to discern justice—
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to your words. I have given you a wise and discerning mind, so that there has been none like you before you, nor shall anyone like you arise after you. 
1KI.3.13	Moreover I have also given you what you did not request—both riches and honor—so that no one among the kings will be like you all your days. 
1KI.3.14	Furthermore, if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.” 
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon awoke and took note of the dream. So he went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he made a feast for all his courtiers. 
1KI.3.16	Later two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	One woman said: “My lord, please! This woman and I live in the same house, and I delivered a child while she was in the house. 
1KI.3.18	On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth to a child. While we were together with no one else with us in the house, just the two of us in the house, 
1KI.3.19	this woman’s child died during the night, because she lay on top of him. 
1KI.3.20	Then she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your handmaid was asleep. She laid him at her breast and laid her dead child at my breast. 
1KI.3.21	When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, he had just died! But when I looked at him closely in the morning, I realized that he was not the son I had borne!” 
1KI.3.22	But the other woman said, “No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son!” But the first woman said, “No! The dead one is your son and the living one is my son!” Thus they spoke before the king. 
1KI.3.23	Then said the king: “The one says, ‘This is my son who is living, and your son is the dead,’ while the other says, ‘No, but your son is the dead one and my son is the living one.’” 
1KI.3.24	Then the king said: “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	Then the king said: “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.” 
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose son was the living one spoke up to the king—for her heart grew tender for her son—and said, “My lord, please! Give her the living child! Only don’t kill him!” But the other said, “It will be neither mine nor yours! Cut it in two!” 
1KI.3.27	Then the king responded by saying, “Give her the living child and certainly don’t kill him. She is the mother.” 
1KI.3.28	When all Israel heard of the verdict that the king had given, they were in awe of the king. For they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
1KI.4.1	Now King Solomon reigned over all Israel, 
1KI.4.2	and these were his officials: Azariah son of Zadok, the 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud, the recorder; 
1KI.4.4	Benaiah son of Jehoiada, in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar, 
1KI.4.5	Azariah son of Nathan, in charge of the officers; Zabud son of Nathan the 
1KI.4.6	Ahishar, in charge of the household; Adoniram son of Abda in charge of the forced labor. 
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each had to make provision for a month in the year. 
1KI.4.8	These were their names: Ben-Hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim; 
1KI.4.9	Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; 
1KI.4.10	Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth (his were Socoh and all the land of Hehper); 
1KI.4.11	Ben-Abinadab in all the height of Dor (Taphath, Solomon’s daughter was his wife); 
1KI.4.12	Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as beyond Jokmeam; 
1KI.4.13	Ben-Geber, in Ramot-Gilead (his were the villages of Jair son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and also his were the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, 60 great cities with walls and bronze bars); 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath, Solomon’s daughter, as wife); 
1KI.4.16	Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar; 
1KI.4.18	Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin; 
1KI.4.19	Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and one who was the officer in the land. 
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea in abundance, eating and drinking and rejoicing. 
1KI.5.1	Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines up to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
1KI.5.2	Solomon’s provision for one day was 30 measures of fine flour, 60 measures of meal, 
1KI.5.3	 10 fat oxen, 20 pasture-fed oxen, 100 sheep, beside deer, gazelles, roebucks and fatted geese. 
1KI.5.4	For he had dominion over the entire region west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had 
1KI.5.5	So Judah and Israel lived securely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.5.6	Solomon had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen. 
1KI.5.7	So those officers provided food for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon’s table, each in his month. They let nothing be lacking. 
1KI.5.8	They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it should be, each according to his charge. 
1KI.5.9	God gave Solomon wisdom and discernment in great measure, and a breadth of understanding as vast as the sand on the seashore. 
1KI.5.10	Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.5.11	For he was wiser than all men—than Ethan the Ezrahite, or Heman, Calcol and Darda, sons of Mahol—and his fame was in all the surrounding nations. 
1KI.5.12	He also composed 3,000 proverbs and his songs were 1,005. 
1KI.5.13	He also spoke about trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall, and he spoke about beasts, birds, creeping things and fish. 
1KI.5.14	People came from everywhere to hear the wisdom of Solomon—from all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.15	Then King Hiram of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram was always a friend of David. 
1KI.5.16	So Solomon sent word to Hiram saying: 
1KI.5.17	“You know how my father David could not build a House for the Name of 
1KI.5.18	But now 
1KI.5.19	So behold, I intend to build a House for the Name of 
1KI.5.20	“So now, command that they cut cedars from Lebanon for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will give you wages for your servants according to whatever you say; for as you know, there is none among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.” 
1KI.5.21	When Hiram heard Solomon’s words, he rejoiced greatly and said: “Blessed be 
1KI.5.22	So Hiram sent word to Solomon saying: “I have heard the message that you sent to me. I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber. 
1KI.5.23	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you indicate to me. There I will break them up and you will carry them away. Then you will accomplish my desire by giving food for my household.” 
1KI.5.24	So Hiram kept providing Solomon with cedar and cypress timber, as much as he desired, 
1KI.5.25	and Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 measures of wheat for food for his household and 20 measures of beaten oil. Thus Solomon would give to Hiram year by year. 
1KI.5.26	 gave Solomon wisdom as He promised him, so there was 
1KI.5.27	King Solomon also imposed forced laborers from all Israel—the levy was 30,000 men. 
1KI.5.28	He sent them to Lebanon, in shifts of 10,000 a month: they would stay a month in Lebanon, then two months at home. Adoniram was over the forced labor. 
1KI.5.29	Solomon had 70,000 porters, and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, 
1KI.5.30	besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work—3,300 who supervised the people who were doing the work. 
1KI.5.31	Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the House with cut stones. 
1KI.5.32	So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders along with the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the House.
1KI.6.1	Now it came to pass, 480 years after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv (which is the second month), that he began to build 
1KI.6.2	Now the House that King Solomon built for 
1KI.6.3	The porch in front of the Sanctuary of the House was 20 cubits in length—corresponding to the breadth of the House—and its depth was ten cubits from the front of the House. 
1KI.6.4	Also for the House he made windows with artistic frames. 
1KI.6.5	Against the wall of the House he built a side-structure surrounding both the Temple and the inner Sanctuary; thus he made side-chambers all around. 
1KI.6.6	The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide. All around on the outside he provided offset ledges in the wall of the House, so that the beams would not be inserted into the walls of the House. 
1KI.6.7	For the House, while being constructed, was built of stone finished at the quarry; with neither hammer, axe nor any iron tool heard in the House during its construction. 
1KI.6.8	The doorway to the lowest story of the side chambers was on the right side of the House. They went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle to the third. 
1KI.6.9	When he finished building the House, he covered the House with beams and planks of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	He built the stories of the side-structure against the whole House, each five cubits high, and they were fastened to the House with timbers of cedar. 
1KI.6.11	Then the word of 
1KI.6.12	“As for this House which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes, execute My ordinances and keep all My 
1KI.6.13	I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.” 
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the House and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	He paneled the walls of the House on the inside with cedar planks of cedar; from the floor of the House to the ceiling he overlaid on the inside with wood; and he overlaid the floor of the House with planks of cypress. 
1KI.6.16	Then he partitioned off 20 cubits at the rear part of the House, using cedar boards from the floor to the ceiling, building it as the inner Sanctuary—the Holy of Holies. 
1KI.6.17	The House, that is, the Sanctuary, was 40 cubits long in front of the inner Sanctuary. 
1KI.6.18	The cedar of the interior of the House was carved as gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was visible. 
1KI.6.19	He prepared an inner Sanctuary within the House, to set there the ark of the covenant of 
1KI.6.20	The inner Sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in height. He overlaid it with pure gold, and overlaid the cedar altar. 
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the interior of the House with pure gold; and he drew chains of gold across the front of the inner Sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	So the entire House he overlaid with gold until the entire House was finished; even the entire altar by the inner Sanctuary he overlaid with gold. 
1KI.6.23	In the inner Sanctuary he made two 
1KI.6.24	The length of one wing of the 
1KI.6.25	and the other 
1KI.6.26	the height of the one 
1KI.6.27	Then he placed the 
1KI.6.28	He also overlaid the 
1KI.6.29	Then he carved all the walls surrounding the House with carved engravings of 
1KI.6.30	and he also covered the floor of both the inner and the outer rooms of the House with gold. 
1KI.6.31	For the entrance of the inner Sanctuary he made doors of olive wood, the frame of the doorposts having five angles. 
1KI.6.32	As for the double doors of olive wood, he carved on them carvings of 
1KI.6.33	He also made for the Temple entrance four-sided doorposts of olive wood 
1KI.6.34	and double doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 
1KI.6.35	He carved 
1KI.6.36	He built the inner court with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams. 
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year, in the month of Ziv, the foundation of the House of 
1KI.6.38	and in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (which is the eighth month), the House was completed in all its parts and according to all its details. So he was seven years building it.
1KI.7.1	But it took Solomon 13 years to build and complete his own palace. 
1KI.7.2	He also built the Forest House of Lebanon: its length was 100 cubits, its width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits, built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 
1KI.7.3	It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers, which were on 45 pillars—15 in a row. 
1KI.7.4	And there were window frames in three rows, with window opposite window in three ranks. 
1KI.7.5	And all the doorways had rectangular frame, and with window opposite to window in three tiers. 
1KI.7.6	He also made a portico of columns, 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide, with a porch in front, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. 
1KI.7.7	He also made the Hall of the Throne where he would judge—the Hall of Justice. It was paneled with cedar from the floor to the ceiling. 
1KI.7.8	His house where he would dwell, set farther back of the hall, was of the same construction. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife. 
1KI.7.9	All these were made of expensive stones—stone cut to size and sawed with saws inside and outside—from the foundation to the top and from the outside to the great court. 
1KI.7.10	The foundation was also made of expensive stones—huge stones, stones eight cubits and stones ten cubits. 
1KI.7.11	Above were expensive stones, cut to measure, and cedar wood. 
1KI.7.12	The surrounding great courtyard had three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams, the same as the inner court of the House of 
1KI.7.13	King Solomon sent for and had Hiram brought from Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali, while his father was a man of Tyre, a coppersmith, and he was filled with wisdom, understanding and skill to do any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and executed all his work. 
1KI.7.15	He fashioned the two bronze pillars, 18 cubits high and 12 cubits in circumference each. 
1KI.7.16	He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set upon the tops of the pillars (the height of each capital was five cubits), 
1KI.7.17	nettings of latticework and twisted threads of chain work for the capitals were on top of the pillars—seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. 
1KI.7.18	So he made the pillars with two rows of pomegranates all around on the netting covering the capitals on top of each capital. 
1KI.7.19	The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the portico were of lily design, four cubits high. 
1KI.7.20	So also the capitals on the two pillars—close to the belly next to the netting were the pomegranates in rows of 200 around both capitals. 
1KI.7.21	Thus he set up the pillars at the porticos of the Temple. He set up the right pillar and named it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz. 
1KI.7.22	On the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished. 
1KI.7.23	Next he made the sea of cast metal, ten cubits across from brim to brim, circular in form, five cubits in its height and 30 cubits in circumference. 
1KI.7.24	Under its brim there were gourds encircling it, ten per cubit, completely surrounding the sea. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with it. 
1KI.7.25	It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea was set on top of them, and all their rear parts were inward. 
1KI.7.26	It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the petals of a lily; it held 11,000 gallons. 
1KI.7.27	Then he made ten bases of bronze—the length of each base was four cubits, the width four cubits and the height three cubits. 
1KI.7.28	The structure of the bases was as follows: they had borders, and borders between the frames, 
1KI.7.29	and on the borders that were below the frames were lions, oxen and 
1KI.7.30	Each base had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. Its four legs had brackets; the brackets were beneath the laver, cast with wreaths at each side. 
1KI.7.31	Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit high, and its opening was round like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half, and also on its opening were engravings, and their borders were square, not round. 
1KI.7.32	The four wheels were underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels were in the base. The height of a wheel was a cubit and half. 
1KI.7.33	And the structure of the wheels was like the structure of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast metal. 
1KI.7.34	There were four brackets at the four corners of each base; each bracket was of one piece with the base itself. 
1KI.7.35	On top of the base there was a band half a cubit high encircling it—its braces and its borders were part of it. 
1KI.7.36	On the plates of the braces and on its borders, he engraved 
1KI.7.37	He made the ten bases like this—all of them cast from the same mold, the same size and same shape. 
1KI.7.38	Then he made ten basins of bronze: one basin held 220 gallons. Each basin was four cubits, and on each of the ten bases was one basin. 
1KI.7.39	Then he set up the laver stands, five on the right side of the House and five on the left side of the House, and set up the sea of cast metal on the right side of the House eastward, toward the south. 
1KI.7.40	Then Hiram made the basins, the shovels, and the sprinkling bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he performed for King Solomon on 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, the two nettings to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, 
1KI.7.42	the 400 pomegranates for the two nettings, two rows of pomegranates for each to cover the two bowls of the capitals on top of the pillars, 
1KI.7.43	the ten bases and the ten basins on the bases, 
1KI.7.44	the one sea and the 12 oxen under the sea, 
1KI.7.45	the pots, the shovels and the basins. All these vessels Hiram made for King Solomon in the House of 
1KI.7.46	The king had them cast in the plain of the Jordan, with clay of the ground between 
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were too many—the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
1KI.7.48	So Solomon made all the equipment that was to be in the House of 
1KI.7.49	the 
1KI.7.50	the cups, the snuffers, the bowls, the wick trimmers and the fire pans, of pure gold; the hinges for the doors of the inner House, the Holy of Holies, and for the doors of the House, that is, of the Temple, of gold. 
1KI.7.51	When all the work that King Solomon did in 
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel—all the heads of the tribes and the ancestral chieftains of the children of Israel—to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of 
1KI.8.2	All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the Feast in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	Then all the elders of Israel came and the 
1KI.8.4	They brought up the ark of 
1KI.8.5	Now King Solomon—and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled to him—were with him before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be numbered or counted. 
1KI.8.6	The 
1KI.8.7	For the 
1KI.8.8	But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner Sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; there they are to this day. 
1KI.8.9	Nothing was in the ark except the two tables of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, when 
1KI.8.10	Now when the 
1KI.8.11	so that the 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon spoke: “
1KI.8.13	I have surely built You a magnificent House, a place for Your dwelling forever.” 
1KI.8.14	Then the king turned his face about and blessed the whole congregation of Israel while the whole congregation of Israel was standing. 
1KI.8.15	He said: “Blessed be 
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day I brought My people Israel out from Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a House where My Name would be there. But I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ 
1KI.8.17	“Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a House for the Name of 
1KI.8.18	But 
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless you will not build the House, but your son who will come out of your loins, he shall build the House for My Name.’ 
1KI.8.20	Now 
1KI.8.21	and have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of 
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of 
1KI.8.23	and said: “
1KI.8.24	“You have kept what You promised with Your servant David my father. Yes, You spoke with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day. 
1KI.8.25	“Now therefore, 
1KI.8.26	Now therefore, God of Israel, please, let Your word be confirmed, which You spoke to Your servant my father David. 
1KI.8.27	So will God really dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You! How much less this House that I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Nevertheless, turn to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, 
1KI.8.29	Let Your eyes be open toward this House night and day, toward the place of which You have said: ‘My Name shall be there;’ listening to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	“So listen to the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and when You hear, forgive! 
1KI.8.31	If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, then comes and swears before Your altar in this House, 
1KI.8.32	then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked, bringing his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, giving him according to his righteousness. 
1KI.8.33	“When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, if they turn back to You and confess Your Name and pray and make supplication to You in this House, 
1KI.8.34	then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers. 
1KI.8.35	“When the skies are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, yet if they pray toward this place and confess Your Name and turn from their sin because You have afflicted them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel. Teach them the good way in which they should walk, and send rain on Your land which You gave to Your people as an inheritance. 
1KI.8.37	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there be blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar, if their enemy should besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague or sickness, 
1KI.8.38	when prayer or supplication is made by anyone or by all Your people Israel—each knowing the plague of his own heart—when one spreads his hands toward this House, 
1KI.8.39	then may you hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, forgive and act, and give to each man according to all his ways, as You know his heart to be. For You alone know the hearts of all the children of men. 
1KI.8.40	Then they will fear You all the days that they live in the land that You gave to our fathers. 
1KI.8.41	“Moreover concerning the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel, when he comes from a distant country because of Your Name—
1KI.8.42	for they will hear of Your great Name, of Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm—when he comes to pray toward this House, 
1KI.8.43	then may you hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner asks of You. So all the peoples of the earth may know Your Name, to fear You as Your people Israel do, and know that this House that I have built is called by Your Name. 
1KI.8.44	“When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way You send them, and they pray to 
1KI.8.45	then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 
1KI.8.46	If they sin against You—for there is no man that does not sin—and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and their captors carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near, 
1KI.8.47	yet if they take it to the heart in the land which they have been carried captive, and they repent and make supplication to You in the land of their captors, saying: ‘We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly,’ 
1KI.8.48	and they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them into exile, and pray to You toward their land that You gave to their fathers, the city that You have chosen and the House which I have built for Your Name, 
1KI.8.49	then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Your dwelling place, maintain their cause, 
1KI.8.50	and forgive Your people who have sinned against You as well as all their transgressions they have transgressed against You, and grant them mercy before their captors, so they may have mercy on them. 
1KI.8.51	For they are Your people and Your inheritance that You brought out of Egypt, out of the middle of the iron furnace. 
1KI.8.52	“May Your eyes be open to the supplication of Your servant and to the supplication of Your people Israel, listening to them whenever they cry to You. 
1KI.8.53	For You have set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, as You spoke by the hand of Moses Your servant, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, my Lord 
1KI.8.54	When Solomon finished praying this entire prayer and petition to 
1KI.8.55	Then he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: 
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be 
1KI.8.57	May 
1KI.8.58	May He incline our hearts to Him, to walk in all His ways and to keep His 
1KI.8.59	May these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before 
1KI.8.60	May all the peoples of the earth know that 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart, therefore, be wholly devoted to 
1KI.8.62	Now the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before 
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to 
1KI.8.64	On that same day, the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the House of 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon and all Israel with him celebrated the Festival at that time—a great congregation from the entrance of Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt—before 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart over all the goodness that 
1KI.9.1	Now it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the House of 
1KI.9.2	that 
1KI.9.3	 said to him: “I have heard your prayer and your petition that you made before Me. I have consecrated this House, which you have built, to put My Name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there every day. 
1KI.9.4	“As for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked—in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing all I commanded you, keeping My statutes and My ordinances—
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your kingship over Israel forever, as I promised your father David saying: ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’ 
1KI.9.6	“But if you or your sons will indeed turn away from following Me—not keeping My 
1KI.9.7	then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and this House which I have consecrated for My Name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
1KI.9.8	This House, now so exalted—everyone passing by it will gasp in shock and hiss, saying: ‘Why has 
1KI.9.9	They will be told: ‘Because they forsook 
1KI.9.10	Now at the end of 20 years during which Solomon had built the two houses—
1KI.9.11	since King Hiram of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar and cypress logs and with gold for all his desire—in return King Solomon gave Hiram 20 cities in the land of Galilee. 
1KI.9.12	So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them. 
1KI.9.13	He said, “What are these cities that you’ve given me, my brother?” So they have been called the land of Kabul to this day. 
1KI.9.14	(Hiram had also sent to the king 120 talents of gold.) 
1KI.9.15	Now this was the purpose of the forced labor that King Solomon had imposed to build 
1KI.9.16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, captured Gezer, burned it with fire, killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and given it as a dowry for his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, lower Beth-horon, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath and Tadmor in the wilderness in the land, 
1KI.9.19	as well as all the storage cities, chariot cities and cavalry cities and that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
1KI.9.20	As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel, 
1KI.9.21	even their children who remained in the land after them whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy utterly, on them Solomon imposed forced labor until this day. 
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not make slaves of the children of Israel, for they were the men of war, his servants, his officials, his captains, his charioteers and his horsemen. 
1KI.9.23	These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, 550 who supervised the people who did the work. 
1KI.9.24	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David to her house built for her, he built the Millo. 
1KI.9.25	Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar that he built for 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Sea of Reeds in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	Hiram sent his servants with the fleet—sailors who knew the sea—along with Solomon’s servants. 
1KI.9.28	So they went to Ophir and took from there 420 talents of gold, and brought it to King Solomon. 
1KI.10.1	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon because of the Name of 
1KI.10.2	So she came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels carrying spices and gold in great abundance, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was on her heart. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon answered all her questions nothing was hidden from the king that he did not explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	So when the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food at his table, the seating of his courtiers, the attendance of his servants and their attire, his cupbearers, and his burnt offering which he offered in the House of 
1KI.10.6	Then she said to the king: “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your deeds and of your wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	But I didn’t believe the reports until I came and my eyes saw it. Indeed, not even the half was told to me. You’re way past the report of wisdom and prosperity that I’d heard! 
1KI.10.8	Blessed are your people, blessed are your courtiers who are standing continually before you, listening to your wisdom. 
1KI.10.9	Blessed be 
1KI.10.10	Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again did such abundance of spices come as what the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
1KI.10.11	Also Hiram’s ships that brought gold from Ophir brought from Ophir a great quantity of sandalwood and precious stones. 
1KI.10.12	The king made from the sandalwood a railing for the House of 
1KI.10.13	So King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire—whatever she asked for—besides what King Solomon gave her out of his royal bounty. Then she and her servants left and returned to her own land. 
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	besides what was from the merchants from the traffic of the traders, and from all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the region. 
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made 200 full body shields of beaten gold—600 shekels of gold on each shield—
1KI.10.17	and 300 small shields of beaten gold—three minas of gold on each shield. The king put them in the Forest House of Lebanon. 
1KI.10.18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with refined gold. 
1KI.10.19	There were six steps to the throne, and the throne had a back with a rounded top, and there were armrests on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps—six on each side—nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	All of King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the Forest House of Lebanon were of pure gold. (None was of silver—that did not count for anything in the days of Solomon.) 
1KI.10.22	For the king had a Tarshish fleet at sea with Hiram’s fleet; once every three years the Tarshish fleet came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks. 
1KI.10.23	So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in wealth as well as in wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	All the earth sought an audience with Solomon, to listen to his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	They brought, each man his gift—vessels of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses and mules—so much year by year. 
1KI.10.26	Solomon accumulated chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	Also the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees in the foothills. 
1KI.10.28	Solomon’s horses were brought from Egypt and from Keveh. The king’s merchants would buy them from Keveh at a price 
1KI.10.29	They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150; and in turn they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. 
1KI.11.1	Now King Solomon loved so many foreign women, besides the daughter of Pharaoh—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites— 
1KI.11.2	from the nations of whom 
1KI.11.3	So he had 700 wives as princesses and 300 concubines—and his women led his heart astray. 
1KI.11.4	For it came about, as Solomon grew old, that his wives led his heart away after other gods, so that his heart was no longer wholly devoted to 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of 
1KI.11.7	At that time Solomon also built a high place for Chemosh, the detested thing of Moab, on the mountain near Jerusalem, as well as for Molech the detested thing of the children of Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	Thus he did for all his foreign wives, who were burning incense and offering sacrifices to their gods. 
1KI.11.9	So 
1KI.11.10	He had commanded him about this, that he should not go after other gods, yet he did not keep what 
1KI.11.11	So 
1KI.11.12	Nevertheless, I will not do it in your days for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it away from the hand of your son. 
1KI.11.13	Yet I will not tear away the whole kingdom, but will give one tribe to your son for My servant David ‘s sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.” 
1KI.11.14	Then 
1KI.11.15	Earlier, when David was at war with Edom, Joab, commander of the army, went up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom.
1KI.11.16	Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.17	But Hadad and some Edomites, servants of his father, had fled to Egypt, while Hadad was a small boy. 
1KI.11.18	Setting out from Midian they came to Paran and took men from Paran along with them, and went to Egypt—to Pharaoh king of Egypt—who gave him a house, allotted him food and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	Then Hadad found great favor in Pharaoh’s eyes, so that he gave him his own sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, as wife. 
1KI.11.20	The sister of Tahpenes gave birth to his son Genubath. Tahpenes weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace and Genubath remained in Pharaoh’s palace among Pharaoh’s sons. 
1KI.11.21	Now when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh: “Let me leave so I may go to my own country.” 
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh replied to him, “What do you lack with me, that all of a sudden, you seek to go back to your own country?” “Nothing,” he answered. “Nevertheless let me go anyway.” 
1KI.11.23	Then God raised up another adversary against him, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord King Hadad-ezer of Zobah, 
1KI.11.24	when David killed them. He then gathered men to himself and became the leader of a marauding band that went to Damascus and dwelt there and gained control in Damascus. 
1KI.11.25	Rezon was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, adding to the trouble that was Hadad. He despised Israel, while he reigned over Aram.
1KI.11.26	Then there was Jeroboam son of Nebat (the name of his mother, a widow, was Zeruah), an Ephraimite of Zereda. Though he was Solomon’s servant, he also raised a hand against the king. 
1KI.11.27	Now the reason that he raised a hand against the king was this: Solomon built the Millo and closed the breach of the city of his father David. 
1KI.11.28	Now the man Jeroboam was mighty of strength, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over the entire labor force of the house of Joseph. 
1KI.11.29	It was around that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had covered himself in a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the field. 
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah seized the new cloak that was on him, tore it into twelve pieces, 
1KI.11.31	and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for thus says 
1KI.11.32	But he will have one tribe, for My servant David’s sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 
1KI.11.33	“‘For they have abandoned Me and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and My ordinances, as his father David did. 
1KI.11.34	Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will keep him as a ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, because he kept My 
1KI.11.35	Yet I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and I will give it to you—the ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	To his son I will give one tribe so that My servant David may have a lamp every day before Me in Jerusalem, the city that I chose for Myself to put My Name there. 
1KI.11.37	“So I will take you and you will reign over all that your soul desires—you will be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	Then it will be, if you obey everything I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My eyes, keeping My statutes and My 
1KI.11.39	So I will for this afflict David’s seed, but not for all days.” 
1KI.11.40	Therefore Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam got up and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt. He remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 
1KI.11.41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom—are they not recorded in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	So the days of Solomon’s kingship in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years. 
1KI.11.43	Then Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam was king in his place.
1KI.12.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	Now when Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it, he was still in Egypt where he had fled from the face of King Solomon and settled in Egypt. 
1KI.12.3	They summoned him, so Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam saying: 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke burdensome. Now therefore lighten the harsh labor of your father and his heavy yoke which he laid on us and we will serve you.” 
1KI.12.5	He said to them: “Go away for three more days and then come back to me.” So the people departed. 
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” 
1KI.12.7	They spoke to him, saying: “If you will be a servant to this people today, serving them, granting them their petition, and speaking favorably to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
1KI.12.8	But he rejected the counsel the elders had given him, instead consulting with the young men who grew up with him and stood before him. 
1KI.12.9	So he asked them, “How do you advise me to respond to these people who have spoken to me saying: ‘Lighten the yoke that your father laid on us?’” 
1KI.12.10	The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him saying: “Thus you should say to these people who spoke to you saying ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us!’ thus you should say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins! 
1KI.12.11	So now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and as for me, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but as for me, I will chastise you with scorpions.’” 
1KI.12.12	Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king told them, saying, “Come back to me on the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	The king answered the people harshly. He rejected the counsel the elders had given him, 
1KI.12.14	and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people. For it was a turn of events from 
1KI.12.16	But when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king saying: “What share have we in David? No inheritance in Jesse’s son! To your tents, O Israel! Now look at your own house, David!” So the Israelites departed to their tents. 
1KI.12.17	But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. Then King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day. 
1KI.12.20	Now when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David. 
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah as well as the tribe of Benjamin—180,000 select soldiers, to fight against the house of Israel in order to restore the kingship back to Rehoboam son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying: 
1KI.12.23	“Speak to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people saying, 
1KI.12.24	Thus says 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam rebuilt Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and resided there. From there he went out and built Penuel.
1KI.12.26	But Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom may return to the house of David. 
1KI.12.27	If this people keep going up to offer sacrifices in the House of 
1KI.12.28	So the king sought counsel and made two golden calves. He said to them, “You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough! Here are your gods O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” 
1KI.12.29	Then he set up one in Bethel and the other he put in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	Now this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even up in Dan. 
1KI.12.31	He also made shrines on the high places and appointed priests from among the people, who were not sons of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	Then Jeroboam instituted a festival in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, imitating the Festival that is in Judah. He went up to the altar that he built in Bethel, to sacrifice to the calves that he had made. He installed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he made. 
1KI.12.33	Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month—in the month that he had made up from his own heart—and made up a festival for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense. 
1KI.13.1	Unexpectedly, a man of God came from Judah to Bethel with the word of 
1KI.13.2	He cried out against the altar with the word of 
1KI.13.3	The same day he gave a sign, saying, “This is the sign that 
1KI.13.4	Now when the king heard the word of the man of God, which he proclaimed against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar saying: “Seize him!” But the hand which he stretched out against him withered—he could not even draw it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was split apart and the fat ashes poured out from the altar, just as was the sign that the man of God gave with the word of 
1KI.13.6	So the king responded by saying to the man of God: “Please seek the face of 
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to the man of God: “Come home with me and have something to eat, and then, I will give you a reward.”
1KI.13.8	But the man of God said to the king: “Even if you give me half your house, I will not go with you nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place. 
1KI.13.9	For so I was charged by the word of 
1KI.13.10	So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel. 
1KI.13.11	Now one old prophet was living in Bethel. His son came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel and all the words that he had spoken to the king they related to their father. 
1KI.13.12	Then their father asked them: “Which way did he go?” For his sons had seen which way the man of God that came from Judah went. 
1KI.13.13	Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me!” So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it. 
1KI.13.14	Then he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. He said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” “I am,” he said. 
1KI.13.15	“Come home with me,” he said to him, “and eat bread!” 
1KI.13.16	But he said: “I cannot return with you nor go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For it was said to me by the word of 
1KI.13.18	So he said to him: “I also am a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me with the word of 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water. 
1KI.13.20	Now while they were sitting at the table, the word of 
1KI.13.21	and he cried to the man of God that came from Judah saying, “Thus says 
1KI.13.22	but turned back, ate bread and drank water in the place of which He said to you, ‘Eat no bread and drink no water,’ your carcass will not enter the tomb of your fathers.” 
1KI.13.23	So after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	But when he was gone, a lion met him along the way and killed him. So his carcass was thrown on the road with both the donkey and the lion standing beside the carcass. 
1KI.13.25	Then, men passed by and saw the carcass thrown on the road with the lion standing by the carcass. So they came and told it in the town where the old prophet lived. 
1KI.13.26	Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard it, he said: “It is the man of God who defied the word of 
1KI.13.27	Then he spoke to his sons saying: “Saddle the donkey for me!” So they saddled it. 
1KI.13.28	Then he went and found his carcass lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing by the carcass. The lion had not eaten the carcass nor mauled the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	Then the prophet picked up the carcass of the man of God, he laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the town of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	He laid his carcass in his own tomb and they mourned over him saying, “
1KI.13.31	After burying him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the message he declared by the word of 
1KI.13.33	Even after this, Jeroboam did not turn back from his evil way, but once again, he appointed priests for the high places from among all ranks of the people. Whoever wanted to be a priest, he consecrated him for the high places. 
1KI.13.34	So this matter became sin against the house of Jeroboam, in the end, wiping it out and destroying it from the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time, Abijah, Jeroboam’s son fell sick. 
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please go disguise yourself, so they won’t recognize you as Jeroboam’s wife, and go to Shiloh. Look, the prophet Ahijah who told me that I would be king over these people is there. 
1KI.14.3	Take with you ten loaves, biscuits and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.” 
1KI.14.4	Jeroboam’s wife did so. She got up and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see for his eyes were dim because of his age. 
1KI.14.5	 had said to Ahijah, “Look! Jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is sick. You are to say such and such to her, for she will be in disguise.” 
1KI.14.6	As soon as Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came through the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this disguise? But I have been sent to you with a difficult message. 
1KI.14.7	Go tell Jeroboam, thus says 
1KI.14.8	I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it you. Yet you have not been like My servant David who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes. 
1KI.14.9	Instead you have done more evil than all who were before you, and have gone and made yourself other gods—molten images to vex Me—and have cast Me behind your back. 
1KI.14.10	Therefore, I am about to bring evil on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off to Jeroboam even one man, bond and free, in Israel. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns the dung until it is all gone. 
1KI.14.11	Anyone who belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and anyone who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat. For 
1KI.14.12	“As for you, arise and go to your house. As soon as you set foot in the town, the boy will die. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel will lament over him and bury him, for it is only him of Jeroboam’s house who will be buried, because in him alone, of all Jeroboam’s house, something good was found toward 
1KI.14.14	“Moreover 
1KI.14.15	 will strike Israel until it sways like a reed in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking 
1KI.14.16	So He will give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam which he committed, and caused Israel to commit.” 
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife got up, left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the child died. 
1KI.14.18	They buried him and all Israel lamented over him, just as was the word of 
1KI.14.19	As for the rest of the deeds of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	The days that Jeroboam reigned were 22 years and then he slept with his fathers. His son Nadab reigned in his place.
1KI.14.21	Meanwhile Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned 17 years in Jerusalem—the city where 
1KI.14.22	Judah did what was evil in 
1KI.14.23	They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every leafy tree; 
1KI.14.24	and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did the same abominations as those of the nations that 
1KI.14.25	Now it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt marched against Jerusalem.
1KI.14.26	He took away the treasures of the House of 
1KI.14.27	So King Rehoboam made in their place bronze shields and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, watching over the doorway of the royal palace. 
1KI.14.28	Whenever the king went to the House of 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the deeds of Rehoboam and all that he did—are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
1KI.14.31	Then Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. Then his son Abijam became king in his place. 
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abi
1KI.15.3	He walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him; and his heart was not wholly devoted to 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless, for David’s sake, 
1KI.15.5	For David did what was right in 
1KI.15.6	As there had been war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life, 
1KI.15.7	so there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. The rest of the deeds of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.15.8	Then Abijam slept with his fathers so they buried him in the city of David, and his son Asa became king in his place.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah. 
1KI.15.10	He reigned 41 years in Jerusalem; his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abi
1KI.15.11	Now Asa did what was right in 
1KI.15.12	He also expelled the male prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	Also he deposed his mother Maacah from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image as an Asherah pole. So Asa cut down her image and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
1KI.15.14	But they did not take away the high places. Nevertheless Asa’s heart was wholly devoted to 
1KI.15.15	He brought into the House of 
1KI.15.16	Now there was war between Asa and King Baasa of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	King Baasa of Israel marched against Judah, and he built up Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah. 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of 
1KI.15.19	“Let there be a treaty between me and you, as it was between my father and your father. I have just sent you a present of silver and gold; go, break your treaty with King Baasa of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me.” 
1KI.15.20	So Ben-Hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth, as well as all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasa heard it, he stopped fortifying Ramah and remained in Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempted—and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber which Baasa had built. Then King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah with them. 
1KI.15.23	Now the rest of all the deeds of Asa, all his might, all he did and the cities that he built—are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and his son Jehoshaphat became king his place.
1KI.15.25	Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	He also did what was evil in 
1KI.15.27	Then Baasa son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasa struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon. 
1KI.15.28	So Baasa slew him, in the third year of King Asa of Judah, and became king in his place. 
1KI.15.29	As soon as he became king, he struck down all the household of Jeroboam. He did not spare Jeroboam anything with breath until he had destroyed him, just as was the word of 
1KI.15.30	because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and caused Israel to commit, by which he utterly provoked 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the deeds of Nadab and all he did—are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.15.32	So there was war between Asa and King Baasa of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.33	In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasa son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, reigning 24 years. 
1KI.15.34	He did what was evil in 
1KI.16.1	Now the word of 
1KI.16.2	“Since I raised you up from the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, yet you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin, vexing Me with their sins. 
1KI.16.3	I am about to consume Baasa and his house. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Anyone of Baasa who dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.” 
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the deeds of Baasa and what he did and his might, are they not written in Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.6	Then Baasa slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah became king in his place. 
1KI.16.7	But the word of 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa of Judah, Elah son of Baasa became king over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years. 
1KI.16.9	Then his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariotry, conspired against him while he was in Tirzah, making himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was in charge of the palace in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.10	Then Zimri went in, struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah, and became king in his place. 
1KI.16.11	It came about when he became king, as soon as he sat on the throne, he struck down all the household of Baasa, leaving him not even one man, nor his kinsmen nor his friend. 
1KI.16.12	So Zimri destroyed the entire house of Baasa, according to the word of 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasa and the sins of his son Elah, which they committed and caused Israel to commit, vexing 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the deeds of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah, Zimri reigned for seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines. 
1KI.16.16	When the people encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and even struck down the king,” then all Israel proclaimed Omri—the commander of the army—king over Israel that very day in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he went into the citadel of the royal palace, and burned down the royal palace over him with fire. So he died too, 
1KI.16.19	because of the sins which he committed, doing what was evil in 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the deeds of Zimri and his treason that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two factions: half of the people followed Tibni son of Ginath, making him king, while the other half followed Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But the people following Omri prevailed against the people following Tibni son of Ginath. Tibni died, and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and reigned 12 years, six years in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	Then he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and built a city on the hill. He named the city that he built Samaria, based on the name Shemer, the owner of the hill. 
1KI.16.25	But Omri did what was evil in 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in the sins that he had caused Israel to commit, vexing 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the deeds of Omri that he did and the valiant deeds that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Then his son Ahab became king in his place. 
1KI.16.29	In the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri began to reign over Israel; and Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria 22 years. 
1KI.16.30	But Ahab son of Omri did what was evil in 
1KI.16.31	Now, as if it was a trifling thing to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he also took as wife Jezebel the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshipped him. 
1KI.16.32	He also erected an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he had built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Also Ahab made the Asherah pole. So Ahab did yet more to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	During his days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. At the cost of Abiram his firstborn, he laid its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son Segub, he set up its gates—according to the word of 
1KI.17.1	Now Elijah the Tishbite, one of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab: “As 
1KI.17.2	Then the word of 
1KI.17.3	“Leave this place, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the Wadi Cherith, east of the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	It will come about that you will drink from the wadi. I have also commanded the ravens to feed you there.” 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according to the word of 
1KI.17.6	The ravens kept bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 
1KI.17.7	Then it came to pass after a while that the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land. 
1KI.17.8	Then the word of 
1KI.17.9	“Arise, go to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have just commanded a widow there to provide for you.”
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath. Now when he came to the town gate, to his surprise, a widow was there gathering sticks. So he called her and said, “Please bring a little water in a jar that I may drink.” 
1KI.17.11	As she was going to fetch it, he called her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 
1KI.17.12	So she said, “As 
1KI.17.13	Elijah said to her, “Fear not! Go and do as you said, but first make me a little cake from what you have there. Bring it out to me and afterwards, make some for you and for your son. 
1KI.17.14	For thus says 
1KI.17.15	So she went and did according to the word of Elijah—and she and he, and her household ate for many days. 
1KI.17.16	The jar of flour was not exhausted, nor did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of 
1KI.17.17	After these things, it came to pass that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house fell sick, and his sickness was getting much worse until he had no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	So she said to Elijah, “What do I have to do with you, man of God? Have you come to me to remind me of my sin and kill my son?” 
1KI.17.19	He said to her, “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her arms, carried him up to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	He cried out to 
1KI.17.21	Then he stretched himself upon the child three times. He cried out to 
1KI.17.22	 listened to the cry of Elijah, so the soul of the child came back into his body and he was revived. 
1KI.17.23	Then Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, “See! Your son is alive.” 
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word in your mouth is truth.”
1KI.18.1	Now it was after many days that the word of 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	Ahab summoned Obadiah who was the steward of the palace. Now Obadiah feared 
1KI.18.4	for when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of 
1KI.18.5	Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis. Perhaps we may find grass and so keep the horses and mules alive and not lose all the animals.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to explore it—Ahab went one way by himself while Obadiah went another way by himself. 
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was on the road, all of a sudden, Elijah met him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” 
1KI.18.8	“It is I,” he answered him. Go tell your lord, ‘Look, Elijah is here!” 
1KI.18.9	“How have I sinned,” he replied, “that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab, to put me to death? 
1KI.18.10	As 
1KI.18.11	“Now you’re saying, ‘Go tell your lord, “Look, Elijah is here!”’ 
1KI.18.12	But as soon as I leave you, the 
1KI.18.13	Wasn’t my lord told what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of 
1KI.18.14	So now you say, ‘Go tell your lord, “Look, Elijah is here!’” He’ll kill me!” 
1KI.18.15	Then Elijah said, “As 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; then, Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	Now when Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, the one who causes trouble for Israel?” 
1KI.18.18	But he answered, “I have not troubled Israel. Rather, it is you and your father’s house—by forsaking the 
1KI.18.19	Now then, send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, together with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent word to all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Then Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I am the only prophet of 
1KI.18.23	Now let them give us two young bulls. Let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it into pieces, lay it on the wood, and put no fire underneath, while I prepare the other bull, lay it on the wood, and put no fire underneath. 
1KI.18.24	Then you will call on the name of your god, and then, I will call on the Name of 
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first—since you are so many. Then call on the name of your god, but put no fire underneath.” 
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull that he gave them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, crying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice—no one was answering. They also danced leaping around the altar that was made. 
1KI.18.27	Now when it was about noon, Elijah mocked them and said, “Shout louder! After all, he is a god! Maybe he’s deep in thought, or he’s relieving himself, or he’s off on a journey, or perhaps he’s asleep and must wake up!” 
1KI.18.28	So they shouted even louder and cut themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until the blood gushed over them. 
1KI.18.29	When midday was past, they kept prophesying ecstatically until the time of offering up the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice, no one answering, no one paying attention. 
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came closer to him. Then he repaired the damaged altar of 
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones—like the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of 
1KI.18.32	and with the stones he built an altar in the Name of 
1KI.18.33	Then he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. 
1KI.18.34	Then he said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” Then he said, “A second time!” and they did it a second time. Then he said, “A third time!” and they did it a third time. 
1KI.18.35	So the water ran around the altar and he also filled the trench with water. 
1KI.18.36	Now it was at the time of offering up the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said, “
1KI.18.37	Answer me, 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of 
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, “
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Let not a single one of them escape.” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon and slew them there. 
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there’s the sound of rain.” 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, crouched on the ground and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	Then he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up, looked, and said, “There’s nothing.” Then he said, “Go back”—seven times—
1KI.18.44	and it was the seventh time that he said, “Look! A cloud as small as a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” Then he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Harness your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’” 
1KI.18.45	In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. Ahab mounted and rode, and headed to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	Now the hand of 
1KI.19.1	Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying, “So let the gods do to me and worse if by this time tomorrow I don’t make your life like the life of one of them.” 
1KI.19.3	Frightened, he got up and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, he left his servant there. 
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom bush. He prayed that he might die. “It’s too much!” he said. “Now, 
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down and slept under the broom bush. Then behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Get up, and eat.” 
1KI.19.6	So he looked, and to his surprise, there by his head was a cake baked on the hot stones and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. 
1KI.19.7	Then the angel of 
1KI.19.8	So he arose and ate and drank, and in the strength of that meal forty days and forty nights went to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
1KI.19.9	When he arrived there at the cave, he spent the night there. Then behold, the word of 
1KI.19.10	“I have been very zealous for 
1KI.19.11	Then He said, “Come out and stand on the mount before 
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake a fire, but 
1KI.19.13	As soon as Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then all of a sudden, a voice addressed him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 
1KI.19.14	“I have been very zealous for 
1KI.19.15	Then 
1KI.19.16	and anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah as prophet in your place. 
1KI.19.17	It shall come to pass that whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will slay; and whoever escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will slay. 
1KI.19.18	Yet I have preserved seven thousand in Israel whose knees have not bowed to Baal and whose mouth has not kissed him.”
1KI.19.19	So he departed from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. Then Elijah crossed over to him and threw his mantle on him. 
1KI.19.20	So he left the oxen and ran after Elijah saying, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” “Come back,” he said to him. “For what have I done to you?” 
1KI.19.21	So he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the oxen’s yoke gear, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, went after Elijah and became his attendant. 
1KI.20.1	Now King Ben-Hadad of Aram gathered all his army. With him were 32 kings, along with horses and chariots. He marched up, besieged Samaria and attacked it. 
1KI.20.2	Then he sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel, 
1KI.20.3	and said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad: ‘Your silver and gold are mine! Your best wives and children are also mine.” 
1KI.20.4	The king of Israel replied, “As you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all I have.” 
1KI.20.5	Then the messengers came back and said, “Thus says Ben-Hadad: Indeed I sent word to you, ordering you to give me your silver, your gold, your wives and your children. 
1KI.20.6	Now I will send my servants to you tomorrow at this time, and they shall search your palace and the houses of your courtiers. Whatever is valuable in your eyes, they shall seize in their hand and take it away.” 
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please know and see how this man is bent on evil! For he sent someone to me for my wives, my children, my silver and my gold, and I didn’t refuse him.” 
1KI.20.8	All the elders and all the people said to him, “Don’t listen to him or consent.” 
1KI.20.9	So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Tell my lord the king: All that you sent to your servant at first, I will do, but this thing I cannot do,” The messengers departed and reported to him. 
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-Hadad sent word to him again saying, “May the gods do so to me and even more, if the dust of Samaria will suffice for handfuls for all the people at my feet.” 
1KI.20.11	The king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him: ‘Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.” 
1KI.20.12	On hearing this reply—while he and the other kings were drinking in the booths—he said to his servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves against the city. 
1KI.20.13	Then behold, a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said, “Thus says 
1KI.20.14	Ahab asked, “By whom?” He said, “Thus says 
1KI.20.15	So he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces. There were 232. After them he mustered all the people of all the children of Israel, 7,000. 
1KI.20.16	They marched out at noon, while Ben-Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths—he and the 32 kings allied with him. 
1KI.20.17	The young men of the rulers of the provinces marched out first. Ben-Hadad sent out scouts, who reported to him saying, “There are men coming out from Samaria.” 
1KI.20.18	He said, “Whether they are coming out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are coming out for battle, take them alive.” 
1KI.20.19	Now when the young men of the rulers of the provinces marched out of the city, with the army following them, 
1KI.20.20	each man struck down his foe. Then the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, but King Ben-Hadad of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	Then the king of Israel went out, struck the horses and chariots, and inflicted on the Arameans a great defeat. 
1KI.20.22	The prophet then approached the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself. Consider carefully what you should do, for at the turn of the year the king of Aram will march up against you.” 
1KI.20.23	Meanwhile, the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their God is a God of the mountains—that’s why they were stronger than us. But let’s fight against them in the plain. Then surely we’ll be stronger than them. 
1KI.20.24	So this is what you should do: remove the kings, each from his post, and appoint governors in their place. 
1KI.20.25	Then muster an army like the army that you lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—and let’s fight against them in the plain, and surely we’ll be stronger than them!” He listened to their advice and acted accordingly. 
1KI.20.26	It came about at the turn of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and marched up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	Now the children of Israel were mustered, given provisions, and marched against them. But when the children of Israel encamped before them, they looked like two little flocks of goats while the Arameans covered the land. 
1KI.20.28	Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and spoke to him saying, “Thus says 
1KI.20.29	So they encamped one over against the other seven days. On the seventh day the battle was joined, and the children of Israel struck down 100,000 of the Aramean foot soldiers in a single day. 
1KI.20.30	The rest fled to Aphek into the city and the wall fell upon 27,000 men that were left. But Ben-Hadad fled into the city, into an inner chamber. 
1KI.20.31	His officials said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let’s put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads, and surrender to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.” 
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, put ropes on their heads, came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says: ‘Please let me live.’” He replied, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.” 
1KI.20.33	The men took it as a good sign and were quick to catch on, so they said, “Yes, Ben-Hadad is your brother.” “Go, bring him,” he said. So Ben-Hadad came out to him and he took him up into his chariot. 
1KI.20.34	Then he said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will give back, and you may set up markets for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” “Then I will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go. 
1KI.20.35	Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of 
1KI.20.36	Then he said to him, “Because you did not obey the voice of 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, “Strike me please!” So the man struck him and wounded him. 
1KI.20.38	Then the prophet left and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with a headband over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	As the king was passing by, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought another man to me and said, ‘Guard this man! If by any means he is missing, then your life will be for his life, or else you will weigh out a talent of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	Then as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of Israel said to him, “So will your sentence be—you yourself have decided it.” 
1KI.20.41	Then he quickly took the headband away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	Then he said to him, “Thus says 
1KI.20.43	Then the king of Israel went home to Samaria sullen and resentful. 
1KI.21.1	Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, next to the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	Ahab spoke to Naboth saying, “Give me your vineyard, so I may have it for a garden of herbs, since it’s right next to my house. I’ll give you a better vineyard than it in exchange, or if it seems better to you, I’ll give you its price in money.” 
1KI.21.3	But Naboth said to Ahab, “
1KI.21.4	So Ahab went into his house sullen and resentful because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him, when he said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He lay down on his bed, turned away his face and would eat no food. 
1KI.21.5	Then his wife Jezebel came to him and asked him, “Why is your spirit so sullen that you are eating no food?” 
1KI.21.6	Then he told her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him: ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or if it pleases you, I’ll give you another vineyard for it,’ but he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’” 
1KI.21.7	Then his wife Jezebel said to him, “Now, do you really govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, eat some food, and let your heart be merry! I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” 
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city. 
1KI.21.9	She wrote in the letters saying, “Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.10	Then seat two sons of Belial before him, and let them testify against him saying, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.” 
1KI.21.11	So the men of his city—the elders and the nobles who lived in his city—did just as Jezebel had bid them, just as was written in the letters that she had sent to them. 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast then seated Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.13	Then the two worthless men came in and sat before him, and the worthless men testified against him, against Naboth, before the people saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” Then they carried him out of the city and stoned him to death. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent word to Jezebel saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.” 
1KI.21.15	Now when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to sell you for money—for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who is in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	You shall speak to him saying, ‘Thus says 
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?” “I have found you,” he answered, “because you have sold yourself over to do what is evil in 
1KI.21.21	‘Behold, I will bring evil upon you, utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel. 
1KI.21.22	I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa son of Ahijah because you provoked My anger by leading Israel to sin.’ 
1KI.21.23	“
1KI.21.24	Any of Ahab who die in the city, the dogs will eat; or any who die in the country, the birds of the sky will eat.’” 
1KI.21.25	Surely there was none like Ahab, who sold himself over to do evil in 
1KI.21.26	He did grossly loathsome acts in following idols just like all that the Amorites had done, whom 
1KI.21.27	Now when Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his body, fasted, lay in sackcloth and walked about subdued. 
1KI.21.28	Then the word of 
1KI.21.29	“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son’s days I will bring the evil upon his house.”
1KI.22.1	Three years remained without war between Aram and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	Then it came about in the third year that King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	 The king of Israel said to his courtiers, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, yet we are still doing nothing to recover it from the hand of the king of Aram?” 
1KI.22.4	Then he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramot-gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
1KI.22.5	Jehoshaphat said further to the king of Israel, “Please inquire of 
1KI.22.6	So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about 400 men, and asked them: “Should I march against Ramot-gilead to battle or should I refrain?” They responded, “Go up, for my Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.” 
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat said: “Is there no longer a prophet of 
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Yes, there is still one by whom we may inquire of 
1KI.22.9	So the king of Israel summoned one of his eunuchs and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah quickly.” 
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, at a threshing-floor at the entrance of Samaria’s gate. All the prophets were prophesying before them. 
1KI.22.11	Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said, “Thus says 
1KI.22.12	Then all the prophets were prophesying so, saying, “Go up to Ramot-gilead and triumph! For 
1KI.22.13	Meanwhile the messenger that went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Behold now, the words of the prophets are uniformly declaring favor to the king. So please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.” 
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, “As 
1KI.22.15	Now when he came to the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we march to Ramot-gilead in battle or should we refrain?” “March and triumph!” he answered, “and 
1KI.22.16	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to speak to me nothing but the truth in the Name of 
1KI.22.17	Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep without a shepherd. Then 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he wouldn’t prophesy good concerning me, only evil?” 
1KI.22.19	Micaiah then continued, “Therefore hear the word of 
1KI.22.20	Then 
1KI.22.21	until a certain spirit came forward and stood before 
1KI.22.22	And he said: ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said: ‘You shall entice him and shall prevail also—go and do so.’ 
1KI.22.23	Now therefore, behold, 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah approached Micaiah, struck him on the cheek and said, “Which way did the 
1KI.22.25	Micaiah replied, “Behold, you will see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide.” 
1KI.22.26	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and take him back to Amon the city governor and to Joash the king’s son, 
1KI.22.27	and say, “Thus says the king: ‘Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’” 
1KI.22.28	Micaiah then said, “If you ever return safely, then 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah marched to Ramot-gilead. 
1KI.22.30	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you, put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle. 
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Aram had commanded his 32 chariot commanders saying, “Do no single combat with anyone, small or great—except the king of Israel.” 
1KI.22.32	So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel!” and they turned aside to do combat with him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	When the captains of the chariots realized that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
1KI.22.34	But a man drew his bow aimlessly and struck the king of Israel between the lower armor and the breastplate. Then he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I’m wounded.” 
1KI.22.35	The battle raged that day, and the king remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. But he died at evening—and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	As the sun was setting, a shout went throughout the army, saying, “Each man to his town, and each man to his land!” 
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	Then they washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria where the harlots washed and the dogs licked up his blood—just as was the word of 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of Ahab’s deeds and all he did, including the ivory palace he built and all the cities he fortified, are they not written in Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
1KI.22.41	Now Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king, and he reigned 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all the ways of his father Asa, not straying from them, but doing what was right in 
1KI.22.44	However, they did not take away the high places, and the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places. 
1KI.22.45	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.46	Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoshaphat along with his might that he showed and how he warred, are they not written in Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.47	He expelled from the land the cult prostitutes remaining from the days of his father Asa. 
1KI.22.48	There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king. 
1KI.22.49	Jehoshaphat made Tarshish ships go to Ophir for gold, but they never went, because the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. 
1KI.22.50	Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants sail with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat refused. 
1KI.22.51	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and his son Jehoram became king in his place. 
1KI.22.52	Ahaziah son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.53	But he did what was evil in 
1KI.22.54	For he worshipped Baal and bowed down to him, vexing 
2KI.1.1	After Ahab’s death, Moab rebelled against Israel. 
2KI.1.2	Now Ahaziah fell down from the balcony of his upper chamber in Samaria and was injured. So he sent messengers and instructed them, “Go inquire of Baal-Zebub the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.” 
2KI.1.3	But an angel of 
2KI.1.4	Therefore thus says 
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned?” 
2KI.1.6	They answered him, “A man came up to meet us and said to us: ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, thus says 
2KI.1.7	Then he said to them, “What kind of man was he that came up to meet you and told you these words?” 
2KI.1.8	They answered him, “He was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist.” “It’s Elijah the Tishbite,” he said. 
2KI.1.9	So the king sent a captain of 50 with his 50 to Elijah. When the captain went up to him, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. So he announced to him, “O man of God, by order of the king, come down!” 
2KI.1.10	In response, Elijah said to the captain of 50, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your 50!” Then fire did come down from heaven and consumed him and his 50. 
2KI.1.11	So the king again sent to him another captain of 50 with his 50 men, who addressed him and said, “O man of God, by order of the king, come down quickly!” 
2KI.1.12	In response, Elijah said to them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your 50.” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his 50. 
2KI.1.13	So the king again sent the captain of a third 50 with his 50. But when the third captain of 50 went up and came near, he knelt before Elijah, and begged him saying, “O man of God, please, let my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours be precious in your eyes! 
2KI.1.14	Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two previous captains of 50 with their 50; but now let my life be precious in your eyes!” 
2KI.1.15	Then the angel of 
2KI.1.16	Then Elijah said to the king, “Thus says 
2KI.1.17	So he died just as was the word of 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the deeds of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	Now it came to pass, when 
2KI.2.2	 Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here please, for 
2KI.2.3	Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that 
2KI.2.4	Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here please, for 
2KI.2.5	Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that 
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here please, for 
2KI.2.7	Then 50 of the sons of the prophets went and stood aside at a distance from them, while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Elijah then took his mantle, wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two of them crossed over on dry ground. 
2KI.2.9	Now as they were crossing over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I will do for you before I am taken from you.” So Elisha said, “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.” 
2KI.2.10	He replied, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so to you; but if not, it will not be so.” 
2KI.2.11	As they were walking along and talking, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
2KI.2.12	As Elisha was watching, he was crying out, “Avi! Avi! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” Then he saw him no more. So he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. 
2KI.2.13	He then picked up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him. When he returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan, 
2KI.2.14	he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen off him, struck the waters and said, “Where is 
2KI.2.15	When the sons of the prophets at Jericho saw him some way off, they said, “The spirit of Elijah has rested on Elisha.” So they came to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	Then they said to him, “Behold now, there are 50 strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the 
2KI.2.17	But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” So they sent 50 men. Though they searched for three days, they did not find him. 
2KI.2.18	When they came back to him while he staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?” 
2KI.2.19	Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Look now, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees, but the water is bad and the land barren.” 
2KI.2.20	He responded, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	Then he went out to the spring of water, threw salt in it and said, “Thus says 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke. 
2KI.2.23	From there he went up to Bethel. As he was going up along the road, some young boys came out of the city. They mocked him saying to him, “Go on up, baldy! Go on up, baldy!” 
2KI.2.24	So he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the Name of 
2KI.2.25	From there he went to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jehoram, Ahab’s son, became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, and he reigned twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	He did what was evil in 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, not turning away from them. 
2KI.3.4	Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep-breeder, and he used to render as tribute to the king of Israel the wool of 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams. 
2KI.3.5	But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So King Jehoram marched out from Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	Then he sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you march with me against Moab to battle?” Jehoshaphat replied, “I will march. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
2KI.3.8	And he added, “By which route will we go up?” He answered, “The route of the wilderness of Edom.” 
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel, the king of Judah and the king of Edom marched. They kept circling roundabout for seven days, but there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	“Ah!” the king of Israel cried, “
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of 
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat replied, “The word of 
2KI.3.13	But Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother!” “No!” the king of Israel said to him, “For has 
2KI.3.14	Elisha said, “As 
2KI.3.15	Now, bring me a musician.” Now as the musician played, the hand of 
2KI.3.16	and he said, “Thus says 
2KI.3.17	For thus says 
2KI.3.18	Yet this is an easy thing in 
2KI.3.19	Then you must strike every fortified city and every major town, cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs of water and ruin every good field with stones.” 
2KI.3.20	Then it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering up the sacrifice, behold—water was flowing from the direction of Edom—so that the water covered the land. 
2KI.3.21	Meanwhile the Moabites heard that the kings had marched to fight against them. So they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor and older, and stood at the border. 
2KI.3.22	When they rose up early in the morning and the sun was shining upon the water, the Moabites saw the water from a distance as red as blood! 
2KI.3.23	So they said, “This is blood! The kings have surely clashed swords and slain each other. Now, to the spoil, Moab!” 
2KI.3.24	But when they came near Israel’s camp, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, who fled before them. Then they invaded, slaughtering the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	They destroyed the cities. Also each man threw his stone onto every good field and covered it. They stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees—until nothing was left except Kir-hareseth with the stones of its wall. However, the slingers encircled it and struck it down. 
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him 700 swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his firstborn son who should have become king in his place and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel that they withdrew from him and returned to their own land. 
2KI.4.1	Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha saying, “Your servant my husband is dead—you know that your servant feared 
2KI.4.2	“What should I do for you?” Elisha asked her. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She replied, “Your handmaid has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.” 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go borrow for yourself vessels from all your neighbors—empty jars—not just a few. 
2KI.4.4	Then go inside and shut the door behind you and behind your sons, and pour into all those vessels, setting aside what is full.” 
2KI.4.5	So she left him and shut the door behind her and behind her sons. They kept bringing the vessels to her and she kept pouring. 
2KI.4.6	When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” But he said to her, “There isn’t another vessel.” So the oil stopped. 
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. So he said, “Go sell the oil and pay your debt, then you and your sons can live on the rest.” 
2KI.4.8	One day when Elisha passed through Shunem, where there was a prominent woman who persuaded him to eat some food. And so it was, whenever he passed through, he would stop for a meal. 
2KI.4.9	Then she said to her husband, “Behold now, I realize that this man who often passes through is a holy man of God. 
2KI.4.10	Please, let’s make a little walled room on the roof, and let’s put there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lampstand for him. Then whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.” 
2KI.4.11	One day he came there, and retired to the upper chamber and lay down there. 
2KI.4.12	Then he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite woman.” When he had called her, she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	He said to him, “Tell her: Behold, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can be done for you? Can something be communicated to the king or to the commander of the army for you?” She answered, “I am living among my own people.” 
2KI.4.14	So he asked, “Then what should be done for her?” Then Gehazi answered, “In fact, she has no son, and her husband is old.” 
2KI.4.15	“Call her,” he said. And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	Then he said, “At this season next year, you will be embracing a son.” But she said, “No, my lord, do not lie to your handmaid, man of God.” 
2KI.4.17	Nevertheless, the woman conceived and bore a son during that season the following year, just as Elisha had told her. 
2KI.4.18	Now when the child was grown, one day he went out to his father among the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	Then he said to his father, “My head, my head!” So he said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	So he picked him up and brought him to his mother. The child sat on her lap until noon, and then died. 
2KI.4.21	She then went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door on him and went out. 
2KI.4.22	Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys that I may run to the man of God and come back.” 
2KI.4.23	But he said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither New Moon nor Shabbat.” But she said, “It will be well.” 
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Move on! Don’t slow down riding unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she set out and came near the man of God at Mount Carmel. Upon seeing her from a distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the Shunammite. 
2KI.4.26	Please, run now to meet her and ask her: ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the boy?’” She answered, “It is well.” 
2KI.4.27	But when she arrived at the mountain, up to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. Then Gehazi stepped forward to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is bitter within her, yet 
2KI.4.28	“Did I ask my lord for a son?” she said. “Didn’t I say, ‘Don’t deceive me’?” 
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, don’t greet him. Or if anyone greets you, don’t answer him; and lay my staff on the face of the child.” 
2KI.4.30	But the mother of the child said, “As 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi passed on ahead of them and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and told him, saying, “The boy has not awakened.” 
2KI.4.32	When Elisha entered the house, there was the child, dead and laying on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	So he entered and shut the door behind the two of them and prayed to 
2KI.4.34	Then he got up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched himself upon him. So the flesh of the child became warm. 
2KI.4.35	Then he stepped down and walked in the house to and fro, and then he got up on the bed and stretched himself on him. The child sneezed seven times, then the child opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	He then called Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite.” So he called her. When she came in to him, he said, “Pick up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came, fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out. 
2KI.4.38	Afterward Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.” 
2KI.4.39	Then one of them went out into the field to gather herbs, found a wild vine and picked from it a lapful of wild gourds. Then he came back and sliced them into the stew pot, for they didn’t know what they were. 
2KI.4.40	Then they served it for the men to eat. But it came to pass as they were still eating the stew, they cried out and said, “O man of God, there is death in the pot.” So they could not eat it. 
2KI.4.41	But he said, “Bring some flour,” and he threw it into the pot and said, “Serve it to the people and let them eat.” So there was nothing bad in the pot. 
2KI.4.42	Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits—20 loaves of barley bread and fresh ears of corn in his sack. Then he said, “Give them to the people that they may eat.” 
2KI.4.43	But his attendant said, “What? Will I set this before a hundred men?” But he said, “Give them to the people that they may eat, for thus says 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly esteemed, because through him 
2KI.5.2	Aram had gone out in bands, and had taken captive a young girl from the land of Israel. So she served Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	Then she said to her mistress, “If only my lord went before the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his 
2KI.5.4	So Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel.” 
2KI.5.5	The king of Aram said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. 
2KI.5.6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel saying, “When this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent my servant Naaman to you, so you may cure him of his 
2KI.5.7	Now when the king of Israel read the letter, he ripped his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending to me to cure a man of his 
2KI.5.8	Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent word to the king saying, “Why have you rent your clothes? Please, let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.” 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha. 
2KI.5.10	So Elisha sent him a messenger, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.” 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was angered and walked away, saying, “I thought he would surely come out to me, stand and call on the Name of 
2KI.5.12	Aren’t Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage. 
2KI.5.13	But his servants approached him and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he told you only to ‘Wash and be clean’?” 
2KI.5.14	So, he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God. Then his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 
2KI.5.15	When he returned with his entire retinue to the man of God, and came and stood before him, he said, “Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Now please, accept a present from your servant.” 
2KI.5.16	But Elisha said, “As 
2KI.5.17	So Naaman said, “If not, then please, let your servant be given two mule loads of soil, for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any other god, except 
2KI.5.18	In this matter, may 
2KI.5.19	Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.” So Naaman departed from him some distance. 
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “Behold, my master held back from accepting what this Naaman the Aramean brought. As 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. Now when Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?” 
2KI.5.22	“It’s all right, he replied. “My master sent me saying: ‘Behold, two young men of the sons of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.’” 
2KI.5.23	Naaman said, “Please, take two talents.” He even urged him, and packed two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them ahead of him. 
2KI.5.24	Now when he arrived at the fortified hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and let the men go, so they departed. 
2KI.5.25	When he entered and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” So he replied, “Your servant has gone nowhere.” 
2KI.5.26	Then Elisha said to him, “Didn’t my heart go, when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to accept money and accept clothes, or olive groves and vineyards, or sheep and oxen, or male and female servants? 
2KI.5.27	Therefore, the 
2KI.6.1	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Behold now, the place where we are living in your presence is too cramped for us. 
2KI.6.2	So please, let’s go to the Jordan and pick from there each one a beam, and make ourselves a place there to live.” “Go,” he answered. 
2KI.6.3	Then one of them said, “Will you please come with your servants?” “I will go,” he answered. 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they began to cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	But as one of them was cutting down a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, “Ah, my master! It was borrowed.” 
2KI.6.6	Then the man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it there, and made the ax head float. 
2KI.6.7	Then he said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it. 
2KI.6.8	Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel. He consulted with his officers, saying, “In such and such a place will be my camp.” 
2KI.6.9	But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, saying, “Be careful not to pass this place, for the Arameans are coming down there.” 
2KI.6.10	So the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of God told him and warned him about, and so he was on his guard there—more than once or twice. 
2KI.6.11	His heart upset over this matter, the king of Aram summoned his officers and said to them, “Tell me, which one of us is on the king of Israel’s side?” 
2KI.6.12	But one of his officers said, “No, my lord the king. Rather, Elisha the prophet who is in Israel keeps telling the king of Israel the very words that you speak in your bedroom!” 
2KI.6.13	So he said, “Go, see where he is, so I may send and seize him.” Then it was reported to him, “Behold, he is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	So he sent horses, chariots and a great army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the city. 
2KI.6.15	Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was surrounding the city. So his attendant said to him, “Alas, my master! What are we going to do?” 
2KI.6.16	“Fear not,” he replied, “for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed and said, “
2KI.6.18	When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to 
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the road, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom you seek.” So he led them to Samaria. 
2KI.6.20	Upon their arrival in Samaria, Elisha said, “
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Shall I surely strike them down, Avi?” 
2KI.6.22	“Don’t strike them down,” he replied. “Would you strike down those whom you have captured with your own sword and bow? Set before them bread and water that they may eat and drink and go back to their master.” 
2KI.6.23	So he prepared a great feast for them. After they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went back to their master. Ever since, the marauding bands of Aram stopped invading the land of Israel. 
2KI.6.24	Now it came to pass after this, that King Ben-hadad of Aram gathered all his army and marched against Samaria and besieged it. 
2KI.6.25	Now there was a great famine in Samaria, since they were besieging it, until a donkey’s head was sold for 80 pieces of silver, and the quarter of a kav of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver. 
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him saying, “My lord the king, help!” 
2KI.6.27	But he said, “If 
2KI.6.28	Then the king asked her, “What’s the matter with you?” She answered, “This woman said to me: ‘Give your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I told her: ‘Give your son that we may eat him’—but she hid her son.” 
2KI.6.30	Now it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes—as he was passing by on the wall, the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath upon his flesh. 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, “May God do so to me and even more, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.” 
2KI.6.32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king had sent a messenger ahead, yet even before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see, this son of a murderer was sent to take away my head! Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?” 
2KI.6.33	While he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. So the king said, “Look! This evil is from 
2KI.7.1	Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of 
2KI.7.2	Then the officer on whose hand the king was leaning responded to the man of God and said, “Look, even if 
2KI.7.3	Now there were four men with 
2KI.7.4	If we say: ‘Let’s go into the city,’ then the famine is in the city, so we will die there; but if we sit still here, we’ll die also. So come, let’s go into the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we’ll live; and if they kill us, we’ll just die.” 
2KI.7.5	So they got up at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans. But when they arrived at the edge of the Aramean camp, behold, no one was there! 
2KI.7.6	For 
2KI.7.7	So they got up and fled at twilight, abandoning their tents, their horses and their donkeys—the entire camp just as it was—and fled for their lives. 
2KI.7.8	When these men with 
2KI.7.9	Then they said to each other, “It’s not right, what we’re doing. This day is a day of good news, and we’re keeping silent! If we wait till the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Let’s go now and report to the king’s household.” 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called out to the city gatekeepers, and told them, “We went to the camp of the Arameans, and look, there was not a single soul there, no human voice—just the horses and the donkeys tied up, and the tents just as they were.” 
2KI.7.11	Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was reported to the royal palace inside. 
2KI.7.12	When the king got up in the night, he said to his courtiers, “Let me tell you now what the Arameans have contrived against us. They know that we are hungry, so they went out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we’ll capture them alive and get into the city.’” 
2KI.7.13	But one of his courtiers answered and said, “Please let some men take five of the remaining horses left in the city—look, they are just like the whole multitude left in it, and look, they will be just like the whole multitude of Israel that has already perished—so let’s send and see.” 
2KI.7.14	So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the army of the Arameans, saying, “Go and see.” 
2KI.7.15	They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was strewn with clothes and equipment, which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and reported to the king. 
2KI.7.16	So the people went out and ransacked the camp of the Arameans. Then a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel—just as was the word of 
2KI.7.17	Now the king appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned, to have charge of the gate—but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died—just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	For when the man of God had spoken to the king, “Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria,” 
2KI.7.19	that officer had answered the man of God and said, “Look, even if 
2KI.7.20	That’s what happened to him—for the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died. 
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life saying, “Arise and go with your household, and stay wherever you can stay, because 
2KI.8.2	So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She and her household went and stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 
2KI.8.3	Now at the end of seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, and she went to the king to appeal for her house and her farm. 
2KI.8.4	Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, “Please tell me,” he was saying, “all the great things that Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	Then it came to pass, just as he was telling the king how he had revived someone who was dead, behold, there was the woman whose son he had revived, appealing to the king for her house and her farm. So Gehazi said, “My Lord the king, this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha revived.” 
2KI.8.6	When the king asked the woman, she told him the story. So the king assigned to her a court official, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the revenue of the field since the day that she left the land until now.”
2KI.8.7	Then Elisha went to Damascus. At the time King Ben-hadad of Aram was sick, and he was told, “The man of God has come all the way here.” 
2KI.8.8	So the king said to Hazael, “Take an offering in your hand and go meet the man of God, and inquire of 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him and took an offering in his hand, of every good thing of Damascus—forty camel-loads—then came and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you saying: ‘Will I recover from this illness?’” 
2KI.8.10	Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him: ‘You will surely recover.’ However, 
2KI.8.11	Then he fixed his gaze steadily on him until he was ashamed, and then the man of God wept. 
2KI.8.12	When Hazael asked, “Why is my lord weeping?” he answered, “Because I know the evil that you will inflict on the men of Israel: their strongholds you will set on fire, their young men you will slay with the sword, their little ones you will dash into pieces, and their pregnant ones you will rip open.” 
2KI.8.13	Then Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do anything of such magnitude?” Elisha answered, “
2KI.8.14	Then he departed from Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.” 
2KI.8.15	But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael became king in his place. 
2KI.8.16	Now in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel—Jehoshaphat had been king of Judah—Jehoram the son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah became king. 
2KI.8.17	He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did—for Ahab’s daughter was his wife—and he did what was evil in 
2KI.8.19	Nevertheless, 
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and set up their own king. 
2KI.8.21	Then Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. It came about that he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the chariot commanders, but his troops fled to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	So Edom kept rebelling from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah also revolted at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	Now the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	Then Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. Then his son Ahaziah became king in his place. 
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram son of King Ahab of Israel, Ahaziah son of King Jehoram of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of King Omri of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	Now he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in 
2KI.8.28	He marched with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramot-gilead, but the Arameans wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	So King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against King Hazael of Aram. Ahaziah son of King Jehoram of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	Then Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets and told him, “Strap up your cloak, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.2	When you arrive there, look out there for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi. Then go in, get him to rise up from among his fellows, and bring him to an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, thus says 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, a young prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.5	Now when he arrived, behold, the army commanders were sitting. So he said, “I have a word for you, commander.” Jehu asked, “For which one of us?” He replied, “For you, commander.” 
2KI.9.6	Then he rose and went inside the house, and the prophet poured the oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says 
2KI.9.7	So you will strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, slave or free, in Israel. 
2KI.9.9	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	The dogs will eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel, and there will be none to bury her.” Then he opened the door and fled. 
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came out to the officers of his master, and one asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did this crazy fellow come to you?” He said to them, “You know the man and his babbling.” 
2KI.9.12	But they said, “It’s a lie! Tell us now.” So he said, “He said something like this to me, saying ‘Thus says 
2KI.9.13	Then they hurried and every man took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and blew the 
2KI.9.14	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram had been defending Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, against King Hazael of Aram. 
2KI.9.15	But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him, when he fought with King Hazael of Aram. Then Jehu said, “If this is your wish, then let no one escape and go out of the city to go to tell the news in Jezreel.” 
2KI.9.16	So Jehu mounted a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. Meanwhile, King Ahaziah of Judah came down to see Joram. 
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman stationed on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troop approaching and said, “I am seeing a troop.” Then Joram said, “Take a horseman and dispatch him to meet them, and let him ask: ‘Is it peace?’” 
2KI.9.18	So the horse rider went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Is it peace?’” But Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn behind me.” So the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger reached them, but didn’t come back.” 
2KI.9.19	Then he dispatched out another horseman, who went to them and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Is it peace?’” But Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn behind me.” 
2KI.9.20	So the watchman reported, saying, “He reached them, but didn’t come back—and the driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi, for he is driving on like a maniac!” 
2KI.9.21	Then Joram ordered, “Hitch up the chariot!” So he hitched up his chariot. Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went out each in his chariot to meet Jehu, and found him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2KI.9.22	Now when Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is it peace, Jehu?” So he answered, “What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?” 
2KI.9.23	So Joram turned his horses around and fled, crying out to Ahaziah, “Treason, Ahaziah!” 
2KI.9.24	But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms, and the arrow went out through his heart, and he collapsed in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then he said to Bidkar his aide, “Pick him up and throw him on the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, when 
2KI.9.26	‘As surely as I have seen the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday—it is a declaration of 
2KI.9.27	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. But Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him too!” They shot him in the chariot at Gur Pass near Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, but he died there. 
2KI.9.28	Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David. 
2KI.9.29	(Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab.) 
2KI.9.30	Now when Jehu arrived at Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it. So she painted her eyes and dressed her hair, and looked out the window. 
2KI.9.31	As Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Is it peace, Zimri, your master’s assassin?” 
2KI.9.32	Then he lifted up his face to the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down toward him. 
2KI.9.33	Then he said, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down—then her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her. 
2KI.9.34	Then he went inside, ate and drank. Then he said, “Attend now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	So they came back and told him. He said, “This is the word of 
2KI.9.37	and the carcass of Jezebel will be as dung upon the face of the field in the property of Jezreel, so that they will not say, “This was Jezebel.”’”
2KI.10.1	Now Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and to the guardians of Ahab’s sons, saying: 
2KI.10.2	“Now as soon as this letter reaches you—since your master’s sons are with you, and you also have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons—
2KI.10.3	choose the best and the most worthy of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.” 
2KI.10.4	But they were very terrified and said, “Look, two kings couldn’t stand before him, how then can we?” 
2KI.10.5	So the steward of the palace, the governor of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent word to Jehu saying, “We are your servants, and will do whatever you tell us to. We won’t make any man king. Do whatever is good in your eyes.” 
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a second letter to them saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, then bring the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel at this time tomorrow.” Now the king’s sons, 70 people, were with the city’s prominent men. 
2KI.10.7	When it came to pass that the letter reached them, they took the king’s 70 sons and slaughtered them, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	When a messenger came and told him saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” he said, “Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 
2KI.10.9	It came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and addressed all the people, “You are innocent. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who struck down all these? 
2KI.10.10	Know then that not a word of 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel—all his nobles, his acquaintances, his priests—until he left him not a survivor. 
2KI.10.12	Then he arose and went on his way to Samaria. As he was at Shearing House of the Shepherds along the way, 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the kinsmen of King Ahaziah of Judah and asked, “Who are you?” “We are the kinsmen of Ahaziah,” they replied, “We’ve come down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen mother.” 
2KI.10.14	“Take them alive!” he said. So they took them alive, then struck them down at the pit of Shearing House, 42 men—he spared not a single one of them. 
2KI.10.15	Now when he left from there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him. So he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart right as my heart is with your heart?” “It is,” Jehonadab replied. “If it is, give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	Then he said, “Come with me and see my zeal for 
2KI.10.17	When he came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained from Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much! 
2KI.10.19	Now therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests, let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal—whoever is missing will not live.” But Jehu did it in cunning, in order to destroy the worshippers of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	Then Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent throughout Israel and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. When they went into the temple of Baal, the temple of Baal was filled from one end to another. 
2KI.10.22	Then he said to the one over the wardrobe, “Bring out vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them. 
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal, and he said to the worshippers of Baal, “Search and look that there is here with you none of the servants of 
2KI.10.24	Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had already stationed 80 of his men outside and said, “If any of the men whom I am bringing into your hands escapes, your life will be for his life.” 
2KI.10.25	Then it came to pass, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in, strike them down—let none get out.” So they struck them down with the edge of the sword, and the guard and the captains threw them out. Then they proceeded to the inner room of the temple of Baal, 
2KI.10.26	brought out the pillars of the temple of Baal, and burned them. 
2KI.10.27	Then they demolished the pillar of Baal, tore down the temple of Baal and turned it into latrines—as it is to this day. 
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel. 
2KI.10.29	However, from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he caused Israel to commit, from these Jehu did not turn away—-the golden calves in Bethel and in Dan. 
2KI.10.30	Now 
2KI.10.31	Yet Jehu was not careful to walk in the 
2KI.10.32	In those days 
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward in all the land of Gilead—the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites—from Aroer by the Arnon Valley up to Gilead and Bashan. 
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	Then Jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in Samaria. And his son Jehoahaz became king in his place. 
2KI.10.36	The days of Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria were 28 years.
2KI.11.1	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being put to death. She put him and his nurse in the bedroom, so he was hidden from Athaliah, so that he was not killed. 
2KI.11.3	He remained with her, hidden in the House of 
2KI.11.4	Now in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains of the hundreds, of both the Carites and the guards, and had them come to him in the House of 
2KI.11.5	Then he commanded them saying, “This is what you will do: one-third of you—those going on duty on Shabbat—keeps watch over the palace. 
2KI.11.6	Then another third will be stationed at the Sur Gate and the last third will be at the gate behind the guards—so you will keep watch over the house on every side. 
2KI.11.7	Your other two divisions, who are off duty on Shabbat, will also keep watch over the House of 
2KI.11.8	So you are to surround the king on every side—every man with his weapons in his hand—whoever breaks through the ranks must be put to death. You must be with the king in his comings and goings.” 
2KI.11.9	So the captains of hundreds did all that Jehoiada the 
2KI.11.10	The 
2KI.11.11	So the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the House to the left side of the House, by the altar and the House, around the king on every side. 
2KI.11.12	Then he brought out the king’s son and put the crown and the insignia on him, and so they proclaimed him king and anointed him. Then they clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!” 
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guards and the people, she came to the people in the House of 
2KI.11.14	She looked and behold, the king was standing by the pillar, as was the custom, with the captains and the trumpets beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason, treason!” 
2KI.11.15	Then Jehoiada the 
2KI.11.16	So they laid hands on her, and brought her to the horses’ entry of the royal palace, where she was put to death. 
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada cut a covenant between 
2KI.11.18	Next, all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They broke his altars and his images into pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. Moreover, the 
2KI.11.19	Then he took the captains over hundreds, the Carites, the guard, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the House of 
2KI.11.20	Then all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet—they had already slain Athaliah with the sword in the royal palace. 
2KI.12.1	Jehoash was seven years old when he became king. 
2KI.12.2	Jehoash began his reign in the seventh year of Jehu and he reigned 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
2KI.12.3	Now Jehoash did what was right in 
2KI.12.4	The high places, however, were not taken away. The people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. 
2KI.12.5	Then Jehoash said to the 
2KI.12.6	let the 
2KI.12.7	But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the 
2KI.12.8	Then King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the 
2KI.12.9	The 
2KI.12.10	But Jehoiada the 
2KI.12.11	Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal scribe and the 
2KI.12.12	Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had been overseeing the House of 
2KI.12.13	and to the masons and the stonecutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to 
2KI.12.14	But there were no silver cups, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, and no vessels of gold or vessels of silver made for the House of 
2KI.12.15	For they gave it to those that did the work, and with it they repaired the House of 
2KI.12.16	They did not check on the men to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, for they dealt faithfully. 
2KI.12.17	The money from the guilt offering and money from the sin offering was not brought into the House of 
2KI.12.18	Then King Hazael of Aram marched and attacked Gath and captured it, and next Hazael set his face to march against Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.19	But King Jehoash of Judah took all the sacred objects that his fathers Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred objects, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the House of 
2KI.12.20	Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.21	But his courtiers arose, conspired against him and assassinated Joash at Beth-Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla. 
2KI.12.22	His courtiers Jozacar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer struck him down, and he died. Then they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. His son Amaziah became king in his place.
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of Joash son of King Ahaziah of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned 17 years. 
2KI.13.2	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.13.3	So the anger of 
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz sought 
2KI.13.5	 gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans, and the men of Israel dwelt in their tents as they had before. 
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he caused Israel to commit, but walked in them—and the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria. 
2KI.13.7	Indeed, Jehoahaz was not left with a force of more than 50 horsemen, 10 chariots and 10,000 foot soldiers, because the king of Aram had destroyed them and trampled them like dust when threshing. 
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	Then Jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in Samaria. His son Joash became king in his place. 
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of King Joash of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned 16 years. 
2KI.13.11	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.13.12	Now the rest of the events of Joash’s reign and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against King Amaziah of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.13	Then Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. So Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 
2KI.13.14	When Elisha got sick with his illness from which he would die, King Joash of Israel came down to him, wept over him and cried, “Avi, avi, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” 
2KI.13.15	Then Elisha said to him, “Take bow and arrows.” So he took bow and arrows. 
2KI.13.16	Then he said to the king of Israel, “Mount your hand on the bow!” So he mounted his hand on it. Elisha then laid his hands on the king’s hands, 
2KI.13.17	and said, “Open the window to the east,” and then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot. Then he said, “
2KI.13.18	Then he said, “Take the arrows!” and he took them. Then he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” and he struck it three times, then stopped. 
2KI.13.19	But the man of God was upset with him and said, “If only you had struck five or six times, then you would have annihilated Aram till you had consumed it. But now you will strike Aram only three times.” 
2KI.13.20	Then Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabite marauders used to invade the land at the spring of the year. 
2KI.13.21	It came about, as they were burying a man, behold, they saw a marauding band, so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. As soon as the man’s body touched Elisha’s bones, he came back to life and stood up on his feet! 
2KI.13.22	But King Hazael of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	Yet 
2KI.13.24	Then King Hazael of Aram died, and his son Ben-hadad became king in his place. 
2KI.13.25	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz restored from the hand of Ben-hadad son of Hazael the towns which he had taken out from the hand of his father Jehoahaz in war. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the towns of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah became king. 
2KI.14.2	He was 25 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	Now he did what was right in the eyes of 
2KI.14.4	Still, the high places were not taken away. The people were still sacrificing and burning incense in the high places. 
2KI.14.5	Once the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his courtiers who had assassinated his father the king. 
2KI.14.6	However, he did not execute the children of the assassins, keeping what is written in the 
2KI.14.7	He struck down 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt, captured Sela in the battle, and renamed it Joktheel, as it is to this day. 
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come! Let’s meet face to face.” 
2KI.14.9	But King Jehoash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, saying, “The briar in Lebanon sent word to the cedar in Lebanon saying: ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But a wild beast in Lebanon passed by and trampled down the briar. 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become arrogant. Glory and stay at home! Why should you provoke trouble and cause your own downfall—you and Judah with you?” 
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen. So King Jehoash of Israel advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah confronted each other at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Judah was routed before Israel—they fled every man to his home. 
2KI.14.13	King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then Jehoash advanced to Jerusalem and breached the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—400 cubits. 
2KI.14.14	He also took all the gold and silver and all the articles that were found in the House of 
2KI.14.15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.16	Then Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then his son Jeroboam became king in his place. 
2KI.14.17	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2KI.14.18	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.14.19	They conspired against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and assassinated him there. 
2KI.14.20	Then they brought his body back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
2KI.14.21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and proclaimed him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
2KI.14.22	It was he who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after the previous king slept with his fathers. 
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned 41 years. 
2KI.14.24	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.14.25	It was he who restored Israel’s border from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, as was the word of 
2KI.14.26	For 
2KI.14.27	But 
2KI.14.28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his might, including how he fought and recovered Damascus and Hamath for Judah in Israel, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.29	Then Jeroboam slept with his fathers with the kings of Israel. His son Zechariah became king in his place. 
2KI.15.1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah became king. 
2KI.15.2	He was 16 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	Now he did what was right in 
2KI.15.4	However, the high places were not taken away—the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. 
2KI.15.5	Then 
2KI.15.6	Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.7	Then Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. Then his son Jotham became king in his place. 
2KI.15.8	In the thirty-eighth year of King Azariah of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria for six months. 
2KI.15.9	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.15.10	Then Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against him and smote him before the people, killed him, and became king in his place. 
2KI.15.11	Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.12	This was the word of 
2KI.15.13	Shallum son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah of Judah, and he reigned for one month in Samaria. 
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem son of Gadi marched up from Tirzah, reached Samaria, then struck down Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, killed him, and became king in his place. 
2KI.15.15	Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, including his conspiracy that he contrived, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.16	Then Menahem struck down Tiphsah and all who were in it, and its territories from Tirzah, because they did not open to him, therefore he attacked it and ripped open all its pregnant women. 
2KI.15.17	In the thirty-ninth year of King Azariah of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria. 
2KI.15.18	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.15.19	Then King Pul of Assyria invaded the country, so Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that his hand might be with him to strengthen his hold on the kingdom. 
2KI.15.20	Menahem exacted the money from Israel, from every person of means, each one 50 shekels of silver to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back and stayed no longer in the land. 
2KI.15.21	Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.15.22	Then Menahem slept with his fathers, and his son Pekahiah became king in his place. 
2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years. 
2KI.15.24	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.15.25	Then Pekah son of Remaliah, his aide, conspired against him and assassinated him in Samaria, in the castle of the royal palace, along with Argob, Arieh, and 50 Gileadite men. So he killed him and became king in his place. 
2KI.15.26	Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.27	In the fifty-second year of King Azariah of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned 20 years. 
2KI.15.28	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria invaded and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee—all the region of Naphtali, and he deported them to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah. He attacked and assassinated him, and then became king in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah son of King Remaliah of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.15.33	He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	Now he did what was right in the eyes of 
2KI.15.35	However, the high places were not taken away, and the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. It was he who built the upper gate of the House of 
2KI.15.36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.37	In those days 
2KI.15.38	Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David. Then Ahaz his son became king in his place. 
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of King Jotham of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. But he did not do what was right in the eyes of 
2KI.16.3	Instead he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son pass through the fire, like the abominations of the nations whom 
2KI.16.4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every leafy tree. 
2KI.16.5	Then King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of King Remaliah of Israel marched against Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. 
2KI.16.6	At that time King Rezin of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, and drove the Jews out of Elath. Then the Edomites came to Elath and settled there to this day. 
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the House of 
2KI.16.9	So the king of Assyria responded to him. The king of Assyria marched up against Damascus and captured it, and deported its inhabitants as captives to Kir and put Rezin to death.
2KI.16.10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria and saw the altar that was at Damascus. So King Ahaz sent to Urijah the 
2KI.16.11	Then Urijah the 
2KI.16.12	When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, the king approached the altar and went up to it. 
2KI.16.13	Then he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar. 
2KI.16.14	As for the bronze altar that was before 
2KI.16.15	Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the 
2KI.16.16	Thus Urijah the 
2KI.16.17	Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands and removed the laver from them. He also took down the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone pavement. 
2KI.16.18	The covered passageway for 
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	Then Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. Then his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king in Samaria over Israel, and he reigned nine years. 
2KI.17.2	He did what was evil in 
2KI.17.3	King Shalmaneser of Assyria marched against him, so Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. 
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria caught Hoshea conspiring—he had sent messengers to King So of Egypt, and had not paid the tribute to the king of Assyria as he had done every year. Therefore the king of Assyria seized him and put him in prison. 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria invaded the entire country, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He placed them in Halah and Habor, on the Gozan River, and in the towns of the Medes. 
2KI.17.7	Now it was so because the men of Israel had sinned against 
2KI.17.8	Instead they followed the customs of the nations, whom 
2KI.17.9	 secretly did things against 
2KI.17.10	and they set up pillars and Asherah poles for themselves on every high hill and under every leafy tree. 
2KI.17.11	There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom 
2KI.17.12	They worshipped idols, about which 
2KI.17.13	Yet 
2KI.17.14	Yet they would not listen, but stiffened their neck like their fathers, who did not trust in 
2KI.17.15	So they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies that He testified against them. Instead they went after futile things and became futile, following the nations that surrounded them, about whom 
2KI.17.16	So they abandoned all the 
2KI.17.17	and they made their sons and daughters pass through the fire, practiced divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in 
2KI.17.18	So 
2KI.17.19	Even Judah did not keep the 
2KI.17.20	So 
2KI.17.21	When He had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drew Israel away from following 
2KI.17.22	The men of Israel kept walking in all the sins that Jeroboam committed. They did not turn away from them, 
2KI.17.23	until 
2KI.17.24	Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria, instead of the men of Israel. So they possessed Samaria and settled in its cities. 
2KI.17.25	When they first began dwelling there, they did not fear 
2KI.17.26	Then they spoke to the king of Assyria saying, “The nations that you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know the requirement of the God of the land. Therefore He has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them because they don’t know the requirement of the God of the land.” 
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded saying, “Send there one of the 
2KI.17.28	So one of the 
2KI.17.29	However, every nation kept making its own gods, and put them in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans had made—every nation in their cities where they settled. 
2KI.17.30	So the people of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the people of Cuth made Nergal, the people of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	So they feared 
2KI.17.33	They continued to fear 
2KI.17.34	Up to this day, they follow their former customs. Nor do they fear 
2KI.17.35	With them 
2KI.17.36	but only 
2KI.17.37	The statutes and the ordinances, and the 
2KI.17.38	The covenant that I have made with you, you will not forget. Nor will you fear other gods, 
2KI.17.39	but 
2KI.17.40	Yet they did not listen, but they continued their former practices. 
2KI.17.41	So while these nations feared 
2KI.18.1	Now it was in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel that Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.18.2	He was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	He did what was right in 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, smashed the pillars and cut down the Asherah poles. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made—for up to those days 
2KI.18.5	He trusted in 
2KI.18.6	For he clung to 
2KI.18.7	So 
2KI.18.8	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territories, from watchtower to fortified city. 
2KI.18.9	Now it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of King Elah of Israel, that King Shalmaneser of Assyria marched against Samaria and besieged it, 
2KI.18.10	and at the end of three years they captured it. So Samaria was captured in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of King Hoshea of Israel. 
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and placed them in Halah and Habor on the Gozan River, and in the towns of the Medes. 
2KI.18.12	For they had not listened to the voice of 
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched against all the fortified towns of Judah and seized them. 
2KI.18.14	So King Hezekiah of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish saying, “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, whatever you impose on me, I will bear.” So the king of Assyria imposed on King Hezekiah of Judah 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	Then Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the House of 
2KI.18.16	At that time Hezekiah stripped off the gold from the doors of the Temple of 
2KI.18.17	Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris and the Rab-shakeh from Lachish with a great army to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. So they went up and arrived at Jerusalem. Now when they arrived, they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller’s field. 
2KI.18.18	When they had called to the king, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the royal palace, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them. 
2KI.18.19	So the Rab-shakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: ‘What is this confidence you’ve relied on? 
2KI.18.20	You say you have a plan and military force for the battle—they are only words of a lip. Who do you rely on now, so that you have rebelled against me? 
2KI.18.21	Behold, you rely on this splintered reed as a staff—Egypt! If a man leans on it, it will go into the palm of his hand and pierce it—thus Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him. 
2KI.18.22	“But if you say to me: ‘We trust in 
2KI.18.23	“So now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,000 horses—if you could put riders of your own on them! 
2KI.18.24	So, how can you repulse a single lieutenant—the least of my master’s servants? Yes, you’re relying on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen. 
2KI.18.25	“Moreover, have I now come up against this land to destroy it without 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the language of the Jews when the people on the wall are listening.” 
2KI.18.27	But the Rab-shakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall—who will eat their own wastes and drink their own urine with you?” 
2KI.18.28	Then the Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the language of the Jews and said: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.29	‘Thus says the king: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand! 
2KI.18.30	Nor let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in 
2KI.18.31	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah! For thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace with me and come out to me. Then everyone will eat from his own vine and fig tree, and everyone will drink water from his own cistern, 
2KI.18.32	until I come, and take you away to a land like your own land—a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die.’ “So don’t listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying: ‘
2KI.18.33	Have any of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their country out of my hand? So will 
2KI.18.36	But the people were silent and did not answer him a word, for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rab-shakeh.
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the House of 
2KI.19.2	Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe and the senior 
2KI.19.3	Then they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, rebuke and contempt. For children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength for giving birth. 
2KI.19.4	Perhaps 
2KI.19.5	When the officials of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	Isaiah said to them: “Thus you will say to your master, ‘Thus says 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I am putting a spirit in him, and he will hear a rumor, and will return to his own country; then I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’” 
2KI.19.8	Then the Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had withdrawn from Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	Now he heard a report of Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia saying, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah saying: 
2KI.19.10	“Thus will you speak to King Hezekiah of Judah saying: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying: Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2KI.19.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands—utterly destroying them—so will you be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered those my fathers destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Tel Assar? 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, or the king of Arpad, or the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, or Ivvah?’” 
2KI.19.14	Then Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the House of 
2KI.19.15	Hezekiah prayed before 
2KI.19.16	Incline Your ear, 
2KI.19.17	It is true, 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire—for they were not gods, but the work of human hands—wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	Now, 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah saying, “Thus says 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that 
2KI.19.22	Whom did you taunt and blaspheme? Against whom did you raise your voice and haughtily lift up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! 
2KI.19.23	Through your servants, you have blasphemed my Lord and said: ‘With my many chariots I have climbed to the heights of the mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon! I cut down its tall cedars and choice cypress trees. I have gone to its farthest lodge, its thickest forest. 
2KI.19.24	I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters, and with the soles of my feet I dried up all the streams of Egypt.’ 
2KI.19.25	Have you not heard? I did it long ago! From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass— that you should turn fortified cities into heaps of rubble. 
2KI.19.26	Their inhabitants are weak-handed, shattered and ashamed They are like the grass of the field and green herb, like grass on roofs, scorched before it is grown up. 
2KI.19.27	But I know your sitting down, your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against Me. 
2KI.19.28	Because your raging against Me and your arrogance reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way you came.” 
2KI.19.29	‘“So this shall be the sign to you: This year you will eat what grows by itself, in the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, you will sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
2KI.19.30	 “‘The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
2KI.19.31	For from Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of 
2KI.19.32	Therefore thus says 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come into this city” —it is a declaration of 
2KI.19.34	“For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.” 
2KI.19.35	Then it came about that night that the angel of 
2KI.19.36	So King Sennacherib of Assyria withdrew, went away, and returned home, and stayed in Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	One day, as he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sarezer struck him down with the sword, and escaped to the land of Ararat. Then his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
2KI.20.1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. So Isaiah the prophet son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says 
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to 
2KI.20.3	“Please, 
2KI.20.4	Then it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out of the middle court, that the word of 
2KI.20.5	“Return, and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, thus says 
2KI.20.6	Then I will add 15 years to your life. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city for My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.’” 
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.” So they took one and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. 
2KI.20.8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that 
2KI.20.9	Then Isaiah said, “This will be the sign to you from 
2KI.20.10	Hezekiah answered, “It’s easy for a shadow to go forward ten steps; no, let the shadow turn back ten steps.” 
2KI.20.11	Then Isaiah the prophet cried to 
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach-baladan, son of King Baladan of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	Now Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them his entire treasure house—the silver and the gold, the spices and the precious oil—and his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah replied, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.” 
2KI.20.15	Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah said, “They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing of my treasuries that I didn’t show them.” 
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of 
2KI.20.17	‘Behold, days are coming when everything in your house, which your fathers have stored up to this day, will be carried to Babylon—nothing will be left,’ says 
2KI.20.18	‘Moreover, some of your descendants—who will issue from you, whom you will father—will be taken away and will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” 
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Good is the word of 
2KI.20.20	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might—including how he made the pool and the tunnel that brought water into the city—are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzi-bah. 
2KI.21.2	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.21.3	For he rebuilt the shrines that his father Hezekiah had destroyed and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, and bowed down to all the host of heaven and worshipped them. 
2KI.21.4	He even built altars in 
2KI.21.5	He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the House of 
2KI.21.6	 He also made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in 
2KI.21.7	Then he set up the carved image of Asherah that he made in the House about which 
2KI.21.8	No longer will I cause the feet of Israel to wander from the land which I gave their fathers—if only they will keep doing all I have commanded them and the whole 
2KI.21.9	But they did not listen, so Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations that 
2KI.21.10	Then 
2KI.21.11	“Since King Manasseh of Judah has done these abominations, and has outdone in wickedness all that the Amorites who were before him did, and has also made Judah sin with his idols, 
2KI.21.12	therefore thus says 
2KI.21.13	I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will utterly wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish—wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	Then I will cast off the remnant of My inheritance and hand them over to their enemies—they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies. 
2KI.21.15	For they have done such evil in My eyes, and kept provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt up to this day.” 
2KI.21.16	Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood until he filled Jerusalem with blood from one end to another—in addition to his sin which he made Judah sin, in doing what was evil in 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the deeds of Manasseh, all that he did and his sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	Then Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own palace, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon became king in his place. 
2KI.21.19	Amon was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	He did what was evil in 
2KI.21.21	So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked in, and worshipped the idols that his father had worshipped, and bowed down to them. 
2KI.21.22	He abandoned 
2KI.21.23	Then Amon’s courtiers conspired against him and assassinated the king in his own palace. 
2KI.21.24	But the people of the land put to death all the conspirators against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the deeds of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	Then he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place. 
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	Now he did what was right in the eyes of 
2KI.22.3	It came to pass in the eighteenth year of King Josiah that the king sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam the scribe, to the House of 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the 
2KI.22.5	Then let them give it into the hand of the workmen appointed to oversee the work on the House of 
2KI.22.6	to the carpenters, builders and masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the House.” 
2KI.22.7	However, there was no accounting made with them for the silver given into their hand, for they dealt faithfully. 
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah the 
2KI.22.9	Then Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said, “Your servants have emptied out the silver that was found in the House and have given it into the hand of the workmen appointed to oversee the work on the House of 
2KI.22.10	Shaphan the scribe also told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the 
2KI.22.11	After the king heard the words of the 
2KI.22.12	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the 
2KI.22.13	”Go, inquire of 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the 
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “Thus says 
2KI.22.16	‘Thus says 
2KI.22.17	For they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, in order to provoke Me with all the work of their hands. Therefore My wrath has been kindled against this place and it will not be quenched.’ 
2KI.22.18	“But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of 
2KI.22.19	because your heart was softened and you humbled yourself before 
2KI.22.20	‘Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers and you will be gathered to your grave in 
2KI.23.1	Then the king sent for and they gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to him. 
2KI.23.2	The king went up to the House of 
2KI.23.3	Then the king stood by the pillar and cut a covenant before 
2KI.23.4	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the 
2KI.23.5	He stopped the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained from burning incense on the high places in the towns of Judah and around Jerusalem, as well those burning incense to Baal, the sun, the moon, the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. 
2KI.23.6	Then he brought out the Asherah pole from the House of 
2KI.23.7	Then he tore down the quarters of the male cult prostitutes that had been in the House of 
2KI.23.8	Then he brought all the priests from the towns of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He also broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the city governor, which were on one’s left as one entered the city gate. 
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless, the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of 
2KI.23.10	Next he defiled Topheth, which is in the Ben-hinnom Valley, so that no one might make his son or daughter pass through the fire for Molech. 
2KI.23.11	Then he did away with the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance of the House of 
2KI.23.12	The king also tore down the altars made by the kings of Judah on the roof—the upper chamber of Ahaz and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the House of 
2KI.23.13	The king also desecrated the shrines facing Jerusalem—to the south of the Mount of Destruction—which King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
2KI.23.14	He smashed the pillars and cut down the Asherah poles and filled their places with human bones.
2KI.23.15	Moreover, the altar that was at Bethel and the shrine built by Jeroboam son of Nebat—who caused Israel to sin—that altar and the shrine he demolished, too. He burned the shrine and ground it to dust, and burned up the Asherah. 
2KI.23.16	Then, as Josiah looked around, he saw the burial caves there on the mountain, so he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar, thus desecrating it—as was the word of 
2KI.23.17	Then he asked, “What is this monument I see?” So the men of the town told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have just done to the altar of Bethel.” 
2KI.23.18	“Let him rest,” he said. “Let no one disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed along with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria to provoke. He did to them just as he had done in Bethel. 
2KI.23.20	All the priests of the high places there he slaughtered on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.21	Then the king commanded all the people saying, “Celebrate the Passover to 
2KI.23.22	For no Passover like this had been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel or in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was observed for 
2KI.23.24	Moreover, Josiah got rid of the necromancers and the mediums, the teraphim and the idols, and all the detestable things that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem—in order to confirm the words of the 
2KI.23.25	Before him there had never been a king like him, who turned to 
2KI.23.26	Nevertheless, 
2KI.23.27	 said, “I will banish Judah also from My presence as I banished Israel, and I have spurned this city, Jerusalem, which I chose, and the House about which I had said: ‘My Name will be there.’” 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the Euphrates River. King Josiah marched against him, but Neco killed him at Megiddo when he saw him. 
2KI.23.30	So his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him and made him king in his father’s place. 
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.23.33	Then Pharaoh Necoh imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, so he would not reign in Jerusalem. He also imposed on the land a fine of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2KI.23.34	Then Pharaoh Necoh installed Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought him to Egypt, and he died there. 
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money in keeping with Pharaoh’s command. He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, each according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh. 
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.24.1	In his days, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded, so Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But he turned and rebelled against him. 
2KI.24.2	Then 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the command of 
2KI.24.4	and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed—for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood that 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place. 
2KI.24.7	No longer did the king of Egypt march out of his country, for the king of Babylon had seized all the land that once belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River. 
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnatan of Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.24.10	At that time, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon’s troops marched against Jerusalem and the city fell under siege. 
2KI.24.11	Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon himself arrived at the city while his troops were besieging it. 
2KI.24.12	Then King Jehoiachin of Judah, his mother, his courtiers, his officials, and his eunuchs surrendered to the king of Babylon. So the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 
2KI.24.13	He also carried off from there all the treasures of 
2KI.24.14	Then He exiled all Jerusalem—all the captains, all the mighty men of valor, all the craftsmen and the smiths—10,000 exiles. None was left except the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
2KI.24.15	So he deported Jehoiachin to Babylon, along with the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officials and the notables of the land—he deported all as captives from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	All the men of valor, 7,000 strong and fit for war, and 1,000 craftsmen and smiths, the king of Babylon also took as captives to Babylon. 
2KI.24.17	Then the king of Babylon appointed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king, and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	But he did what was evil in 
2KI.24.20	For through the anger of 
2KI.25.1	Now it came to pass in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his entire army advanced against Jerusalem, set up camp by it, and built a siege wall all around it. 
2KI.25.2	So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.3	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine became so severe in the city that there was no bread for the common people. 
2KI.25.4	Then the city was broken into, and all the warriors fled by night by the way of the gate between the double walls near the king’s garden—though the Chaldeans were all around the city—and they went by the way to the Arabah. 
2KI.25.5	But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	So they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and passed sentence on him. 
2KI.25.7	They slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in bronze chains and took him to Babylon. 
2KI.25.8	Now on the seventh day of the fifth month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon—Nebuzaradan, the captain of the imperial guard, officer of the Babylonian king, came to Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	He burned down the House of 
2KI.25.10	Then the whole Chaldean army that was with the captain of the guard demolished the walls of Jerusalem on every side. 
2KI.25.11	Then the remnant of the people who were left in the city—the deserters who had defected to the Babylonian king and the rest of the populace—Nebuzaradan captain of the guard exiled them. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and field hands. 
2KI.25.13	Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars that were in the House of 
2KI.25.14	They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the pans and all the bronze vessels that were used in Temple service. 
2KI.25.15	The captain of the guard took away the fire pans and the basins—whatever was gold or silver. 
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands which Solomon had made for the House of 
2KI.25.17	The height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, with a bronze capital on top. The height of the capital was three cubits, with a netting of copper pomegranates encircling the capital. The same was true of the second pillar with its netting. 
2KI.25.18	Then the captain of the guard took away Seraiah the chief 
2KI.25.19	From the city he took an official who had been overseeing the soldiers and five of the royal advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the army captain who mustered the people of the land, and 60 men of the common people that were found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was exiled from its land. 
2KI.25.22	Now as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had left, he appointed over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan. 
2KI.25.23	Now when all the captains of the troops, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite—they and their men. 
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah swore to them and to their men and said to them, “Don’t be afraid of the Chaldean officials. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.” 
2KI.25.25	But it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, of royal descent, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah, so he died along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	So all the people, young and old, and the captains of the troops, got up and fled to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. 
2KI.25.27	Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, that King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year he became king, released King Jehoiachin of Judah from Prison. 
2KI.25.28	He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
2KI.25.29	So he changed his prison garments, and regularly ate bread in the king’s presence all the days of his life. 
2KI.25.30	As for his allowance, a regular allowance was granted to him by the king, an allotment for each day, all the days of his life.
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah: 
ISA.1.2	Listen! Heavens, and hear, earth, for 
ISA.1.3	The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its manger, but Israel does not know, My people do not understand.” 
ISA.1.4	 , a sinful nation, a people weighed down with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, sons dealing corruptly! They have abandoned 
ISA.1.5	Where will you be struck again, as you stray away more and more? The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint. 
ISA.1.6	From the foot to the head there is no soundness. Wounds, bruises and raw sores: not pressed, nor bandaged, nor softened with oil. 
ISA.1.7	Your land is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your fields, strangers devour it in your presence—a desolation, overthrown by strangers. 
ISA.1.8	So the Daughter of Zion is left as a 
ISA.1.9	Unless 
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of 
ISA.1.11	“For what is it to Me— the multitude of your sacrifices?” says 
ISA.1.12	When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand— trampling My courts? 
ISA.1.13	Bring no more worthless offerings! Incense is an abomination to Me. New Moon and Shabbat, the calling of convocations —I cannot endure it— iniquity with solemn assembly. 
ISA.1.14	Your New Moons and your Festivals My soul hates! They are a burden to Me. I am weary to bear them. 
ISA.1.15	When you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. When you multiply prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood!”
ISA.1.16	“Wash and make yourselves clean. Put away the evil of your deeds from before My eyes. Cease to do evil. 
ISA.1.17	Learn to do good, seek justice, relieve the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.” 
ISA.1.18	“Come now, let us reason together,” says 
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obey, you will eat the good of the land. 
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword.” For the mouth of 
ISA.1.21	How the Faithful City became a harlot! She once was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her— but now murderers! 
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross, your wine diluted by water. 
ISA.1.23	Your princes are rebellious and friends with thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and chases after rewards. They do not defend the orphan, nor does a widow’s case come to them. 
ISA.1.24	Therefore says the Lord 
ISA.1.25	Then I will turn My hand on you, purge away your dross, and remove all your alloy. 
ISA.1.26	I will restore your judges as at first, your counselors as at the start. Afterward you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful City. 
ISA.1.27	Zion will be redeemed with justice, her repentant with righteousness.” 
ISA.1.28	But there will be a crushing of transgressors and sinners together. Forsaking 
ISA.1.29	For they will be ashamed of the sacred oaks that you desired, and embarrassed because of the gardens that you have chosen. 
ISA.1.30	For you will be like an oak of withering leaf, like a garden that has no water. 
ISA.1.31	So the strong will become tinder and his work like a spark— both will burn together, and no one will quench them.
ISA.2.1	The word which Isaiah, son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 
ISA.2.2	It will come to pass in the last days that the mountain of 
ISA.2.3	Then many peoples will go and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of 
ISA.2.4	He will judge between the nations and decide for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more. 
ISA.2.5	Come house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of 
ISA.2.6	For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob. For they are filled with soothsayers from the east, and they have clapped hands with the children of foreigners. 
ISA.2.7	Their land also is full of silver and gold, nor is there any limit to their treasures. Their land also is full of horses, nor is there any limit to their chariots. 
ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idols. They worship the work of their hands, what their own fingers have made. 
ISA.2.9	So humanity bows down as each one lowers himself. Pardon them not! 
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock and hide in the dust, for fear of 
ISA.2.11	The man of haughty eyes is humbled, the lofty ones brought low, for 
ISA.2.12	For the day of 
ISA.2.13	against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up, against all the oaks of Bashan, 
ISA.2.14	against all the high mountains, against all the exalted hills, 
ISA.2.15	against every high tower, against every fortified wall, 
ISA.2.16	against all the Tarshish ships, and against all the luxury boats. 
ISA.2.17	The pride of man will be humbled, the arrogance of men abased, for 
ISA.2.18	The idols will completely pass away. 
ISA.2.19	People will go into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth, because of the fear of 
ISA.2.20	In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they made to worship, to the moles and to the bats! 
ISA.2.21	They go into the clefts of the rocks and the crevices of the crags, because of fear of 
ISA.2.22	Stop trusting in mankind —whose breath is in his nose— for what is he really worth?
ISA.3.1	For behold! The Lord, 
ISA.3.2	mighty man and man of war, judge, and prophet, fortune-teller and elder, 
ISA.3.3	captain of 50 and man of rank, counselor, crafty magician and cunning charmer. 
ISA.3.4	I will set children as their rulers. Capricious ones will govern them. 
ISA.3.5	The people will oppress one another— each one by his fellow, each one by his neighbor. The child will be insolent to the aged, and dishonorable to the honorable. 
ISA.3.6	When a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: “You have a cloak, you be our ruler! This ruin is under your charge.” 
ISA.3.7	In that day he will protest, saying: “I’m no healer! In my house is no bread or cloak. Don’t make me a ruler of people!” 
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah is fallen. For their tongue and their actions are against 
ISA.3.9	The expression of their faces bears witness against them. They display their sin like Sodom— they do not hide it. 
ISA.3.10	Say to the righteous, he will be well, eating the fruit of their deeds. 
ISA.3.11	 , the wicked! It will be bad for him, for the dealing of his hands will be done to him. 
ISA.3.12	My people! Children are their oppressors and women rule over them. My people! Your guides mislead you and destroy the way of your paths. 
ISA.3.13	 arises to contend a case, and stands to judge the people. 
ISA.3.14	 will enter into judgment with the elders of His people and with the princes: “You have devoured the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses. 
ISA.3.15	What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the face of the poor?” says 
ISA.3.16	Moreover 
ISA.3.17	therefore 
ISA.3.18	In that day 
ISA.3.19	pendants and bracelets, veils, 
ISA.3.20	headdresses, armlets, sashes, perfume vials, amulets, 
ISA.3.21	rings and nose-jewels, 
ISA.3.22	festal robes, capes, cloaks, purses, 
ISA.3.23	lace scarves, fine linen, turbans and veils. 
ISA.3.24	Now it will come to pass: Instead of sweet spices there will be rottenness; instead of a sash, rags; instead of curled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty. 
ISA.3.25	Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle. 
ISA.3.26	Her gates will lament and mourn. Desolate, she will sit on the ground.
ISA.4.1	Seven women will grab hold of one man in that day, saying: “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel. Only let us be called by your name— take away our reproach!”
ISA.4.2	In that day the Branch of 
ISA.4.3	So it will come to pass that whoever is left in Zion and whoever remains in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 
ISA.4.4	After 
ISA.4.5	then 
ISA.4.6	Then there will be a 
ISA.5.1	Let me sing of my beloved, a song of my beloved, about His vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard in a very fertile hill. 
ISA.5.2	He dug it out and cleared its stones, planted it with a choice vine, built a tower in the midst of it, and even cut out a winepress. He expected it to yield good grapes, but it yielded worthless grapes. 
ISA.5.3	So now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard. 
ISA.5.4	What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done? Why then, when I expected it to yield good grapes, did it yield worthless grapes? 
ISA.5.5	So now, I will make known to you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge, and it will be eaten up. I will break down the fence, and it will be trodden down. 
ISA.5.6	I will lay it waste: it will not be pruned or hoed, but briers and thorns will come up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it. 
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of 
ISA.5.8	Woe to those who join house to house and merge field to field, until there is no room, and you will live alone in the midst of the land! 
ISA.5.9	In my ears, 
ISA.5.10	Ten acres of vineyard will yield six gallons, and an omer of seed will yield one ephah. 
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise up early in the morning— so they may pursue liquor, who stay up late at night, until wine inflames them! 
ISA.5.12	Harp and lyre, tambourine and flute, and wine are at their banquets. They do not notice 
ISA.5.13	“Therefore My people are in captivity for lack of knowledge. Their honorable men are famished and their multitudes parched with thirst. 
ISA.5.14	Therefore 
ISA.5.15	So humanity will be bowed down mankind will be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty humbled.” 
ISA.5.16	But 
ISA.5.17	Then lambs will graze as if in their own pasture, and nomads will eat in the ruins of the wealthy. 
ISA.5.18	 to those that drag iniquity along with cords of deceit, and sin as if with a cart rope! 
ISA.5.19	They say: “Let Him hurry up and hasten His work, so we may see it! Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so we may know it!” 
ISA.5.20	 to those who call evil good and good evil, who present darkness as light and light as darkness, who present bitter as sweet, and sweet as bitter! 
ISA.5.21	 to those who are wise in their own eyes, and clever in their own sight! 
ISA.5.22	 to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant at mixing drinks, 
ISA.5.23	who justify the wicked for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of justice! 
ISA.5.24	Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes straw, and as chaff collapses into the flame, so their root will be like rot, and their blossom will go up like dust. For they have rejected the 
ISA.5.25	Therefore 
ISA.5.26	He will lift up a banner to nations far off, and will whistle for them from the ends of the earth. Look! Swiftly, speedily they come! 
ISA.5.27	None will be weary and none stumble among them; none will slumber or sleep; no belt will be loose at the waist; no strap of sandals be broken. 
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharp and all their bows bent; their horse hooves will be like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind. 
ISA.5.29	Their roaring will be like a lion. They will growl like young lions— yes, they will roar, seize their prey and carry it away safely— and there will be none to rescue. 
ISA.5.30	They will roar against them like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress! The light is darkened by the clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year of King Uzziah’s death, I saw 
ISA.6.2	Seraphim were standing above Him. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 
ISA.6.3	One called out to another, and said: “Holy, holy, holy, is 
ISA.6.4	Then the posts of the door trembled at the voice of those who called, and the House was filled with smoke. 
ISA.6.5	Then I said: “
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me, with a glowing coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
ISA.6.7	 He touched my mouth with it and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips. Your iniquity is taken away, and your sins atoned for.” 
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the voice of 
ISA.6.9	Then He said: “Go! Tell this people: ‘Hear without understanding, and see without perceiving.’ 
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat, their ears heavy, and their eyes blind. Else they would see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return, and be healed.” 
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “
ISA.6.12	 will drive people far away. The desertion of the land will be vast. 
ISA.6.13	Though a tenth still be in it, it will again be burned. As a terebinth tree or as an oak whose stump remains when cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump.” 
ISA.7.1	Now it came about in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah, son of Remaliah of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 
ISA.7.2	When it was reported to the house of David saying: “Aram is camped in Ephraim,” his heart as well as the heart of his people shook like the trees of the forest shaking with the wind. 
ISA.7.3	Then 
ISA.7.4	and say to him, ‘Keep calm and be quiet. Do not fear nor be faint-hearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, nor of the son of Remaliah, 
ISA.7.5	because Aram has plotted harm against you, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us go up against Judah, terrorize it, divide it for ourselves, and appoint Tabeel’s son as king in the midst of it.” 
ISA.7.7	Thus says 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within 65 years Ephraim will be broken and not be a people. 
ISA.7.9	The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you do not trust, you will not stand.”
ISA.7.10	Then 
ISA.7.11	“Ask for a sign from 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask—I wouldn’t test 
ISA.7.13	Then he said, “Hear now, house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary men? Will you also weary my God? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore 
ISA.7.15	He will be eating curds and honey by the time he knows to refuse evil and choose good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the boy knows to refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned. 
ISA.7.17	 will bring—on you, on your people and on your father’s house such days as have never come since the day Ephraim separated from Judah—the king of Assyria! 
ISA.7.18	In that day 
ISA.7.19	Then they will come, all of them— and will settle in the steep wadis and in the clefts of the cliffs and in all the thorn bushes and in all the watering holes. 
ISA.7.20	In that day 
ISA.7.21	In that day it will be that a man will rear a calf and two sheep, 
ISA.7.22	and from the abundant milk they give, he will eat curds— for anyone left in the land will eat curds and honey. 
ISA.7.23	In that day it will be that every place where there were 1,000 vines worth 1,000 silver shekels will become briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.24	With arrows and bows one will come there, since all the land will become briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	As for all the hills that were tilled with the hoe—you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns. Instead it will be for grazing of oxen and roaming of sheep.
ISA.8.1	Then 
ISA.8.2	So I took for myself trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the 
ISA.8.3	Then I went to the prophetess; and she conceived and bore a son. Then 
ISA.8.4	For before the child will have knowledge to cry ‘my father!’ or ‘my mother!’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.8.5	Then 
ISA.8.6	“Because these people have refused the softly flowing waters of Shiloah, and rejoice with Rezin and Remaliah’s son, 
ISA.8.7	therefore behold, 
ISA.8.8	Then it will sweep through Judah, overflow as it passes through, reaching even to the neck! So the spread of its wings will be the full breadth of your land! Immanuel! 
ISA.8.9	Make an uproar, O peoples— but you will be broken in pieces. Give ear, all you of far countries. Arm yourselves—yet be shattered! Arm yourselves—yet be shattered! 
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, but it will amount to nothing. Speak a word, but it will not stand. For God is with us! 
ISA.8.11	For thus 
ISA.8.12	 “Do not say: ‘It’s a conspiracy!’ about everything that these people call a conspiracy. You must not fear or tremble at what they fear. 
ISA.8.13	, Him will you sanctify, and let Him be your fear, trembling at Him. 
ISA.8.14	He will be a Sanctuary, but a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
ISA.8.15	Many among them will stumble, fall, and be broken, snared and caught. 
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction with My disciples. 
ISA.8.17	I will wait for 
ISA.8.18	Here I am with the children that 
ISA.8.19	When they say to you: “Consult the mediums and necromancers who chirp and mutter,” shouldn’t a people seek their God? Should a people consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
ISA.8.20	To 
ISA.8.21	They will pass this way that are hard-pressed and hungry, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will become enraged and curse their king and their God. Whether they turn their faces upward 
ISA.8.22	or look to the earth, behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and they will be driven into darkness.
ISA.8.23	But there is no gloom to her who was in anguish, as in time past. He treated lightly the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future He will bring glory— by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan— Galilee of the Gentiles. 
ISA.9.1	The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Upon those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, light will shine. 
ISA.9.2	You will multiply the nation. You will increase the joy. They will rejoice before You like the joy in the harvest, as they revel when they divide spoil. 
ISA.9.3	For You will break the burdensome yoke and the rod on his shoulder— the war-club of his oppressor— as in the day of Midian. 
ISA.9.4	For every stomping boot quaking and cloak rolled in blood will be for burning— fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.5	For to us a child is born, a son will be given to us, and the government will be upon His shoulder. His Name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God My Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. 
ISA.9.6	Of the increase of His government and 
ISA.9.7	 sent a word to Jacob, and it fell upon Israel. 
ISA.9.8	All the people will know what Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria say in pride and in arrogance of heart: 
ISA.9.9	“The bricks are fallen, but we will rebuild with cut stones. The sycamores are cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.” 
ISA.9.10	Therefore 
ISA.9.11	The Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west— they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, yet His hand is still outstretched. 
ISA.9.12	Yet the people will not turn back to the One who strikes them, nor will they seek 
ISA.9.13	So 
ISA.9.14	The elder and the man of rank— he is the head. The prophet who teaches falsehood— he is the tail. 
ISA.9.15	The leaders of this people lead them astray. Those they mislead are swallowed up. 
ISA.9.16	Therefore 
ISA.9.17	For wickedness burns like a fire and consumes the briers and thorns It kindles the thickets of the forest, so they roll up in a column of smoke. 
ISA.9.18	By the wrath of 
ISA.9.19	One grabs with the right hand but is hungry, and eats with the left hand but is not satisfied. Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm— 
ISA.9.20	Manasseh will devour Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh, both are against Judah. For all this His anger is not turned away, yet His hand is outstretched.
ISA.10.1	 to those enacting unjust decrees and recording corrupt legislation, 
ISA.10.2	to deprive the helpless of justice and rob the rights of the poor of My people, so that widows may be their spoil and orphans their prey! 
ISA.10.3	What will you do in the day of visitation, when desolation comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth? 
ISA.10.4	One can only crouch among the captives or collapse among the slain. For all this His anger is not turned away, yet His hand is still outstretched. 
ISA.10.5	 to Assyria, the rod of My anger— the club in their hand is My indignation! 
ISA.10.6	I am sending it against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My fury I am commissioning it, to take spoil and plunder, to trample them down like mud in the streets. 
ISA.10.7	Yet that is not what Assyria intends, nor is that what he is thinking about. Rather his heart is to destroy, and to cut down nations—only a few! 
ISA.10.8	For he says: “Aren’t all my princes kings? 
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus? 
ISA.10.10	As my hand has reached the kingdoms of the idols—with more graven images than Jerusalem and Samaria— 
ISA.10.11	as I’ve done to Samaria and her idols, won’t I also do to Jerusalem and her idols?” 
ISA.10.12	Therefore it will come to pass, when 
ISA.10.13	For he said: “By the strength of my own hand I’ve done it, and my own wisdom, for I am shrewd! I abolished the borders of peoples, and plundered their treasures. As a mighty one I cast down inhabitants. 
ISA.10.14	My hand found the riches of the peoples as a nest—like gathering forsaken eggs, I have gathered the entire earth. Not a wing fluttered, not a beak opened or chirped!” 
ISA.10.15	Should the axe boast against the One who chops with it? Should the saw magnify itself against the One who wields it? It would be like a rod waving the One who lifts it, or like a staff hoisting up the One who is not wood! 
ISA.10.16	Therefore will the Lord 
ISA.10.17	So the light of Israel will become a fire, and its Holy One a flame. He will burn and consume its thorns and briers in one day. 
ISA.10.18	Both the glory of his forest and his fruitful field, he will consume, both soul and body. It will be like a sick man wasting away. 
ISA.10.19	The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few, a child could record them.
ISA.10.20	Yet it will come about in that day that the remnant of Israel— those of the house of Jacob who escaped— will never again depend on the one who struck them down, but will depend upon 
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God. 
ISA.10.22	For though your people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction has been decreed. Justice overflows. 
ISA.10.23	For a complete destruction, as decreed, will 
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus says 
ISA.10.25	“For in a very little while My indignation against you will be spent, and My anger will turn to their destruction.” 
ISA.10.26	 will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the Rock of Oreb. As His staff was over the sea, so will He lift it up, as He did in Egypt. 
ISA.10.27	In that day his burden will be taken off your shoulders, and his yoke off your neck. Indeed, the yoke will be broken because of fatness. 
ISA.10.28	He has come to Aiath, and passed through Migron. At Michmas he deposited his supplies. 
ISA.10.29	They have crossed over the pass. They have taken up lodging at Geba. Ramah is terrified; Gibeath-shaul has fled. 
ISA.10.30	Shriek your cry, daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laish! O poor Anathoth! 
ISA.10.31	Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim take cover. 
ISA.10.32	This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his fist at the mountain of the Daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, 
ISA.10.34	Yes, He will hack down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon with its majesty will fall. 
ISA.11.1	Then a shoot will come forth out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch will bear fruit out of His roots. 
ISA.11.2	The 
ISA.11.3	His delight will be in the fear of 
ISA.11.4	But with righteousness He will judge the poor, and decide with fairness for the poor of the land. He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked. 
ISA.11.5	Also righteousness will be the belt around His loins, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.
ISA.11.6	The wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, the calf and the young lion and the yearling together, and a little child will lead them. 
ISA.11.7	The cow and the bear will graze, their young ones lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like an ox. 
ISA.11.8	A nursing child will play by a cobra’s hole, and a weaned child will put his hand into a viper’s den. 
ISA.11.9	They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of 
ISA.11.10	It will also come about in that day that the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek for Him, and His resting place will be glorious. 
ISA.11.11	It will also come about in that day that my Lord will again redeem— a second time with His hand— the remnant of His people who remain from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
ISA.11.12	He will lift up a banner for the nations, and assemble the dispersed of Israel, and gather the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
ISA.11.13	Ephraim’s envy will end, those hostile to Judah will be cut off. Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim. 
ISA.11.14	They will swoop down on the Philistine slope to the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east— laying their hand on Edom and Moab, the children of Ammon obeying them. 
ISA.11.15	Then 
ISA.11.16	So there will be a highway for the remnant of His people who remain, from Assyria, as there was for Israel in the day they came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	In that day you will say: “I will give You thanks, 
ISA.12.2	Behold, God is my salvation! I will trust and will not be afraid. For the Lord 
ISA.12.3	With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation. 
ISA.12.4	In that day you will say: “Give thanks to 
ISA.12.5	Sing to 
ISA.12.6	Cry out and shout, inhabitant of Zion! For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.13.1	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw: 
ISA.13.2	Lift up a banner on a bare mountain, raise a voice to them, wave a hand, so that they may enter the gates of the nobles. 
ISA.13.3	I have commanded My consecrated ones, yes, I have called My mighty ones, My proud exulting ones, for My fury. 
ISA.13.4	A sound of tumult in the mountains like that of many people! A sound of uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathered! 
ISA.13.5	They are coming from a far country— from the end of the heavens— 
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the day of 
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man’s heart will melt. 
ISA.13.8	They will be terrified; pain and anguish will take hold of them; they will writhe as a woman in labor; they will look aghast at one another— their faces aflame! 
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of 
ISA.13.10	For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. 
ISA.13.11	I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, and abase the insolence of tyrants. 
ISA.13.12	I will make people scarcer than gold, even than the pure gold of Ophir. 
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make heaven tremble, and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of 
ISA.13.14	It will be like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep with no one gathering. Each will return to his own people, each will flee to his own country. 
ISA.13.15	Everyone found will be thrust through. Everyone caught will fall by the sword. 
ISA.13.16	Their babes will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be plundered, and their wives ravished. 
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, who will not value silver and will take no delight in gold. 
ISA.13.18	Their bows will cut down the young men, with no pity on the fruit of the womb, nor will their eye spare children. 
ISA.13.19	So Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of Chaldean pride, will be just as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 
ISA.13.20	It will never be inhabited, nor will it be dwelt in from generation to generation, nor will an Arab pitch a tent there, nor will shepherds let flocks lie there. 
ISA.13.21	But desert creatures will lie there. Their houses will be full of owls. Ostriches will dwell there, and goat-demons will dance there. 
ISA.13.22	Hyenas will howl in their citadels and jackals in their pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come— her days will not drag on long. 
ISA.14.1	For 
ISA.14.2	The peoples will take them and escort them to their place. The house of Israel will possess them in the land of 
ISA.14.3	Now in the day when 
ISA.14.4	you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon and say: “How the taskmaster has ceased! The raging oppressor, exacter of gold, has ceased! 
ISA.14.5	 has broken the rod of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers, 
ISA.14.6	which struck the people in wrath with continual strokes, which ruled the nations in fury, with relentless persecution. 
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest, and quiet. They break forth with a ringing cry! 
ISA.14.8	Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, along with the cedars of Lebanon: “Since you were laid low, no woodcutter comes up against us.” 
ISA.14.9	 from below is excited about you, to meet you at your coming! He stirs up the dead spirits for you, even the chief ones of the earth. He makes all the kings of the nations rise up from their thrones. 
ISA.14.10	They all answer and say to you: “Even you have become as weak as us? Have you become like us? 
ISA.14.11	Your pomp is brought down to 
ISA.14.12	How you have fallen from heaven, O brightstar, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the earth, you who made the nations prostrate! 
ISA.14.13	You said in your heart: “I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit upon the mount of meeting, in the uttermost parts of the north. 
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the high places of the clouds— I will make myself like Elyon.” 
ISA.14.15	Yet you will be brought down to 
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will stare at you, reflecting on what has become of you: “Is this the one who shook the earth, who made kingdoms tremble, 
ISA.14.17	who made the world a wilderness and destroyed its cities, who never opened the house of his prisoners?” 
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, all of them, lie in glory, each in his own house. 
ISA.14.19	But you are cast out of your tomb as a discarded branch, garment of the slain, pierced with a sword, dumped into a stony pit, a corpse trodden underfoot. 
ISA.14.20	You will not join with them in burial, because you ruined your land, you slaughtered your own people. The offspring of evildoers will never be named. 
ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers, so they would not rise up and possess the land, or fill the face of the earth with cities. 
ISA.14.22	“For I will rise up against them”—it is a declaration of 
ISA.14.23	“I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, with marshes of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction.” It is a declaration of 
ISA.14.24	 has sworn, saying: “Surely, as I thought it, so it will be. As I have purposed, so it will stand. 
ISA.14.25	I will break Assyria in My land. On My mountains I will trample him. Then his yoke will be taken off them, his burden removed from their shoulder. 
ISA.14.26	This is the purpose planned for the whole earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.” 
ISA.14.27	For 
ISA.14.28	In the year king Ahaz died came this burden: 
ISA.14.29	Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia, that the rod that struck you is broken. For from the serpent’s root comes a viper and its fruit will be a flying serpent. 
ISA.14.30	The firstborn of the poor will feed, and the needy will lie down in safety. I will kill your root with famine, and your survivors will be slain. 
ISA.14.31	Wail, O gate! Cry, O city! Melt away, all you of Philistia! For smoke is coming from the north, and there is no straggler in its ranks. 
ISA.14.32	What will they answer the messengers of the nation? For 
ISA.15.1	The burden of Moab. For in the night that Ar is devastated, Moab is ruined; for in the night that Kir is devastated, Moab is ruined. 
ISA.15.2	He has gone up to the shrine, to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is bald, every beard shaven. 
ISA.15.3	In their streets they wear sackcloth. On their housetops and in their plazas, everyone wails, weeping profusely. 
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Elealeh cry out. Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry aloud, his soul faints within him. 
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab. Her fugitives are as far as Zoar as a three year old heifer, for by the ascent of Luhith they go up with weeping, for on the way of Horonaim they raise a cry of distress. 
ISA.15.6	The waters of Nimrim are desolate. The grass is withered away, the new grass withers, there is nothing green. 
ISA.15.7	Therefore the riches they had gotten and whatever they have stored, they carry over the Wadi of Willows. 
ISA.15.8	For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, the wailing to Eglaim, and the wailing to Beer-elim. 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring on Dimon even more— a lion for those escaping from Moab, and for those remaining in the land.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs to the ruler of the land from Sela in the desert to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion. 
ISA.16.2	For like fluttering birds, scattered from a nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon. 
ISA.16.3	‘Give counsel, execute justice. Cast your shadow like night at noonday. Hide the refugees, do not betray the fugitive. 
ISA.16.4	Let My refugees stay with you. Be for Moab a hiding place from the face of the destroyer. For the extortion is at an end, devastation ceases, oppressors are gone from the land. 
ISA.16.5	A throne will be established in mercy, and One will sit on it in truth —in the tent of David— One who seeks justice and is ready for righteousness. 
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab— very proud is he—of his haughtiness, his arrogance, his insolence, and his dishonest boasting. 
ISA.16.7	Therefore Moab will wail for Moab— everyone will wail! For the sweet cakes of Kir-hareseth you will moan, utterly stricken. 
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon have withered, as well as the vine of Sibmah. Rulers of nations have trampled the choice clusters, that reached as far as Jazer and into the desert, its branches spread out and crossed to the sea. 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh. For on your summer and your harvest the battle cry has fallen. 
ISA.16.10	Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field. In the vineyards, no singing for joy no happy shouting, no treading wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop. 
ISA.16.11	Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a lyre, and my inward part for Kir-heres. 
ISA.16.12	So it will be, when Moab is weary upon the high place and comes to his sanctuary to pray, it will do him no good. 
ISA.16.13	This is the word that 
ISA.16.14	But now 
ISA.17.1	The burden of Damascus: Behold, Damascus will cease as a city and will become a ruinous heap. 
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks—they will lie down and no one will frighten them. 
ISA.17.3	The fortress will also cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus. The remnant of Aram will be like the glory of 
ISA.17.4	Now in that day Jacob’s glory will fade, and the fatness of his flesh grow lean. 
ISA.17.5	It will be as when the harvester gathers the standing grain and reaps the heads with his arm, as when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim. 
ISA.17.6	Only gleanings will remain, as when beating an olive tree— two or three olives at the very top, four or five on a fruitful tree’s branches. It is a declaration of 
ISA.17.7	In that day a man will look to his Maker and his eyes will turn to the Holy One of Israel. 
ISA.17.8	He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor will he look to what his fingers have made—neither the Asherah poles nor the sun-images. 
ISA.17.9	In that day the strong cities will be like forsaken forests and treetops that were abandoned, because of 
ISA.17.10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation and you have not remembered the Rock of your strength. Therefore you plant delightful plants and set out exotic vines. 
ISA.17.11	In the day that you plant, you fence it in, and in the morning you made your seed to sprout— but the harvest will be a heap in a day of grief and incurable pain. 
ISA.17.12	 ! The uproar of many peoples who roar like the roaring of the seas. The rumbling of nations, who rush in like the rumbling of mighty waters! 
ISA.17.13	The nations will rush in like the rumbling of many waters, but He will rebuke them so they will flee far away, chased like chaff on the hills before the wind, like whirling dust before the storm. 
ISA.17.14	At evening time—sudden terror! Before morning, they are no more. This is the reward of those who plunder us and the lot of those who pillage us. 
ISA.18.1	 ! The land of whirring wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, 
ISA.18.2	that sends ambassadors by sea, in papyrus vessels upon the water. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, a nation powerful and oppressive, whose land the rivers divide. 
ISA.18.3	All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, look! when a 
ISA.18.4	For so 
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, as soon as blossoming is over and flower becomes ripening grape, He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, He will cut back and remove the twigs. 
ISA.18.6	They will be left together for the mountain birds of prey and the beasts of the land. The birds of prey will summer on them, and all the beasts of the land will winter upon them. 
ISA.18.7	At that time tribute will be brought to 
ISA.19.1	The burden of Egypt: Behold, 
ISA.19.2	I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian. Everyone will fight against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor— city against city, kingdom against kingdom. 
ISA.19.3	The spirit of Egypt will drain within it, and I will confuse its counsel. So they will resort to idols, charmers, mediums and familiar spirits. 
ISA.19.4	I will give the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master—a fierce king will rule over them. It is a declaration of 
ISA.19.5	The waters from the sea will dry up, and the river will be drained dry. 
ISA.19.6	Then the channels will stink. The streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. Reeds and rushes will rot. 
ISA.19.7	The bulrushes by the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile, and everything sown by the Nile will wither, blow away and be no more. 
ISA.19.8	Then the fishermen will lament. All who cast hooks in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish. 
ISA.19.9	Moreover the workers of fine flax, and the weavers of white cloth will be ashamed. 
ISA.19.10	Her pillars will be crushed, All hired workers will be grieved in soul. 
ISA.19.11	The princes of Zoan are utter fools. Pharaoh’s wisest counselors are stupid. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, a son of ancient kings”? 
ISA.19.12	Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now! Let them know what 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan are fools. the princes of Noph are deceived. The cornerstone of her tribes have led Egypt astray. 
ISA.19.14	 has mixed within her a spirit of dizziness. They make Egypt stagger in every work, as a drunkard staggers in his vomit. 
ISA.19.15	There will be no work for Egypt to do, for head or tail, palm branch or rush. 
ISA.19.16	In that day Egypt will be like women trembling with fear, because of the shaking hand of 
ISA.19.17	The land of Judah will terrify Egypt. Anyone who mentions it will be afraid, because of what 
ISA.19.18	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan, swearing allegiance to 
ISA.19.19	In that day there will be an altar to 
ISA.19.20	It will be as a sign and a witness to 
ISA.19.21	So 
ISA.19.22	So 
ISA.19.23	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. 
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing in the midst of the earth. 
ISA.19.25	For 
ISA.20.1	In the year that the Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it, 
ISA.20.2	at that time 
ISA.20.3	Then 
ISA.20.4	so will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered, to Egypt’s shame. 
ISA.20.5	So they will be dismayed and ashamed, because they hoped in Ethiopia and boasted in Egypt. 
ISA.20.6	Then the inhabitants of the coastland will say in that day, ‘Look, such is our hope—there we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! Now, how will we escape?’”
ISA.21.1	The burden of the desert by the sea: As windstorms sweep over the South, so it comes from the desert, a terrifying land. 
ISA.21.2	A harsh vision has been shown to me: “The traitor betrays, and the plunderer plunders. Go up, Elam! Besiege, Media! I have put an end to all her groaning.” 
ISA.21.3	Therefore my body is filled with pain. Pangs have taken hold of me like the pangs of a woman in labor. I am bewildered by what I hear, terrified by what I see. 
ISA.21.4	My heart is bewildered, terror overwhelms me. The twilight I longed for has been turned into trembling. 
ISA.21.5	Set the table, spread out the cloth! Eat! Drink! “Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!” 
ISA.21.6	For 
ISA.21.7	When he sees a chariot with a pair of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him pay attention— very close attention!” 
ISA.21.8	Then he cried out like a lion: “Upon the watch tower, 
ISA.21.9	Look! Here comes a chariot of men, with a pair of horsemen.” Then one answered and said, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of her gods are broken on the ground.” 
ISA.21.10	O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, what I heard from 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah: One calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?” 
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, “Morning comes, yet also it is night.” If you would inquire, inquire. Come back again.” 
ISA.21.13	The burden of Arabia: In the desert brush of Arabia you will stay for the night, you caravans of Dedanites. 
ISA.21.14	To him who is thirsty bring water, inhabitants of the land of Tema, meet the fugitive with food. 
ISA.21.15	For they fled from swords, from drawn sword, from bent bow and distress of war. 
ISA.21.16	For thus 
ISA.21.17	and the remainder of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few. For 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the Valley of Vision: What is the matter with you now? For you have gone up to the rooftops. 
ISA.22.2	You were full of noise, a boisterous city, an exultant town? Your dead were not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. 
ISA.22.3	All your rulers have fled together, then captured without a bow. All who were caught were taken into exile together, though they had fled far off. 
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said, “Look away from me! Let me weep bitterly— don’t try to comfort me about the ruin of the daughter of my people.” 
ISA.22.5	For my Lord 
ISA.22.6	Elam took up the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. 
ISA.22.7	So it will come to pass that your choicest valleys will be full of chariots and horsemen posted at the gate. 
ISA.22.8	So He will expose Judah’s defense, and in that day you will look for the armor in the Forest House. 
ISA.22.9	Then you will see the breaches in the walls of the city of David—for they will be many—though you collect the water of the lower pool. 
ISA.22.10	Though you counted the houses of Jerusalem, you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
ISA.22.11	You even made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool—but you did not look to the Maker, or consider the One who planned it long before. 
ISA.22.12	Now in that day, 
ISA.22.13	But instead, there is joy and gladness, slaughtering cattle and killing sheep, meat and drinking wine! “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!” 
ISA.22.14	But 
ISA.22.15	Thus says my Lord 
ISA.22.16	‘What are you doing here, and who are you to be here, that you cut out a grave for yourself, carving out a tomb on the height, chiseling a crypt for yourself in the rock? 
ISA.22.17	Behold, strong man, 
ISA.22.18	He will roll you up tightly and toss you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and your glorious chariots will be the shame of your Master’s house. 
ISA.22.19	I will remove you from your post, and pull you down from your station. 
ISA.22.20	“In that day I will summon my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah. 
ISA.22.21	I will clothe him in your robe and fasten your sash on him. I will give your authority into his hands, so he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder—what he opens, no one can shut; what he shuts, and no one can open. 
ISA.22.23	I will fasten him as a peg in a firm place, and he will be a throne of honor to his father’s house. 
ISA.22.24	They will hang all the glory of his father’s house on him—offspring and posterity, all the small vessels, from bowls to all the jars. 
ISA.22.25	“In that day,” says 
ISA.23.1	The burden of Tyre. Wail, ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed. There is no house and no harbor. From the land of Cyprus, it was revealed to them. 
ISA.23.2	Be still, inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, your messengers crossing the sea. 
ISA.23.3	On many waters the grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile was her revenue and a marketplace of nations. 
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, O Sidon. For the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not writhed or given birth. I have not reared young men or brought up maidens.” 
ISA.23.5	When the report reaches Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report about Tyre. 
ISA.23.6	Cross over to Tarshish. Wail, you inhabitants of the island! 
ISA.23.7	Is this your jubilant city? Whose antiquity is from long ago, whose feet have taken her to settle in far off lands? 
ISA.23.8	Who planned this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of earth? 
ISA.23.9	 has planned it, to defile the pride of all glory, to shame all the honored of earth. 
ISA.23.10	Overflow through your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish! There is no restraint any more. 
ISA.23.11	His hand has stretched out over the sea, He has shaken the kingdoms. 
ISA.23.12	He said, “You will exult no more.” O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Cyprus— even there you will have no rest. 
ISA.23.13	Look, the land of the Chaldeans— this is the people who no longer exist. Assyria set it up for desert animals. They set up their siege towers; they stripped its palaces; they made it a ruin. 
ISA.23.14	Wail, you ships of Tarshish! For your stronghold is destroyed. 
ISA.23.15	Then it will come about in that day that Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, like the days of one king. At the end of 70 years it will happen to Tyre just as in the song of the prostitute: 
ISA.23.16	“Take a harp, stroll about the city, forgotten harlot! Skillfully play many songs, so you may be remembered.” 
ISA.23.17	Then it will come about after the end of 70 years that 
ISA.23.18	 Yet her profit and her wages will be set apart to 
ISA.24.1	Behold, 
ISA.24.2	So it shall be: as with the people, so with the 
ISA.24.3	The land will be utterly emptied, and totally plundered. For 
ISA.24.4	The land faints and fades away, The world wilts and fades away, The exalted people of the earth wilt. 
ISA.24.5	The land is polluted by its inhabitants, for they have transgressed 
ISA.24.6	Therefore a curse will devour the land. Those dwelling there are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the land will be burned up, so the people remaining are few. 
ISA.24.7	The new wine fails, the vine wilts, all the merry-hearted sigh. 
ISA.24.8	The glee of tambourines stops, the noise of revelers ends, the joy of the harp ceases. 
ISA.24.9	They no longer drink wine with song. Liquor is bitter to those drinking it. 
ISA.24.10	The shattered city is in chaos. Every house is shut up, none may enter. 
ISA.24.11	In the streets is an outcry for wine; all joy becomes dark as evening; the mirth of the land is banished. 
ISA.24.12	The city is left in ruins; the gate is battered down.
ISA.24.13	So will it be in the earth and among the nations, as when shaking an olive tree, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest. 
ISA.24.14	They will raise their voices, They will sing for joy, of the majesty of 
ISA.24.15	‘Therefore glorify 
ISA.24.16	From the ends of the earth we have heard songs: “Glory to the righteous!” But I say, “I waste away, I waste away! 
ISA.24.17	Panic, pit and trap are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth. 
ISA.24.18	And it shall come to pass: whoever flees from the sound of panic will fall in the pit, and whoever climbs up out of the pit will be caught in the trap. For the windows of heaven are opened and the foundations of the earth shake. 
ISA.24.19	The earth is broken apart, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken utterly. 
ISA.24.20	The earth reels to and fro like a drunk, and sways like a hut. its transgression is so heavy upon it that it will fall and never rise again. 
ISA.24.21	It will come about in that day, 
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together, like prisoners in the Pit, and will be shut up in the prison, and after many days be punished. 
ISA.24.23	Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed, for 
ISA.25.1	, You are my God, I will exalt You, I will praise Your Name, for You have done wonderful things, plans of old with steadfast faithfulness. 
ISA.25.2	For You have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a foreigner’s palace a city no more— never to be rebuilt. 
ISA.25.3	Therefore a strong people will honor You. Cities of ruthless nations will fear You. 
ISA.25.4	For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the rainstorm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against the wall. 
ISA.25.5	Like heat in a dry place, You subdue the roar of foreigners. Like heat in the shade of a cloud, the song of tyrants is brought low. 
ISA.25.6	On this mountain, 
ISA.25.7	On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the veil spread over all nations. 
ISA.25.8	He will swallow up death forever. my Lord 
ISA.25.9	It will be said in that day: “Behold, this is our God, We waited for Him—He will save us. This is 
ISA.25.10	For the hand of 
ISA.25.11	When he spreads his hands in it as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim, his pride will be brought down low together with the trickery of his hands. 
ISA.25.12	He will level your high-fortified walls, lay them low, and cast them down to the ground, down to dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city. He appoints salvation as its walls and ramparts. 
ISA.26.2	Open the gates! Let the righteous nation enter— one that keeps faith. 
ISA.26.3	You keep in perfect peace one whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. 
ISA.26.4	Trust in 
ISA.26.5	For He humbles those dwelling on high, leveling the lofty city, leveling it to the ground, bringing it down to the dust. 
ISA.26.6	Feet will trample it down, feet of the afflicted, the footsteps of the poor. 
ISA.26.7	The way of the righteous is straight. Upright One, You make smooth the path of the righteous. 
ISA.26.8	Yes, in the way of Your judgments, 
ISA.26.9	My soul longs for You at night, yes, my spirit within me seeks You. For when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 
ISA.26.10	Though grace is shown to the wicked, he does not learn righteousness. Even in a land of uprightness he will act wrongly, not perceiving the majesty of 
ISA.26.11	, Your hand is lifted up, yet they do not see it; They will see Your zeal for the people and be put to shame. Yes, fire will devour Your enemies. 
ISA.26.12	, You will establish 
ISA.26.13	, other lords beside You have had dominion over us, but we remember Your Name alone. 
ISA.26.14	The dead do not live— dead souls do not rise. Thus You punished and destroyed them and wiped out all memory of them. 
ISA.26.15	You have increased the nation, 
ISA.26.16	, they sought You in distress, they poured out a whispered prayer when Your discipline was upon them. 
ISA.26.17	As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so we were before You, 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child, we have been in pain, yet we gave birth to wind. We are accomplishing no deliverance for the earth, nor are inhabitants of the world coming to life. 
ISA.26.19	Yet it will be: “Your dead will live! My corpses will rise! Awake and shout for joy, you who dwell in the dust! Your dew is like the dew of the dawn. The land of dead souls will come to life! 
ISA.26.20	Go, my people, enter your rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide for a little while, until the wrath is past. 
ISA.26.21	For behold, 
ISA.27.1	In that day 
ISA.27.2	“In that day sing to her, ‘A vineyard of delight!’ 
ISA.27.3	I, 
ISA.27.4	It is not that I have wrath. Who would give me thorns and thistles? Into battle I would march against them! I would burn them up altogether! 
ISA.27.5	Rather let them rely on My strength. Let them make peace with Me— make peace with Me.”
ISA.27.6	In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit. 
ISA.27.7	Did He strike Israel as He struck those who struck them? Or were they slain as their slayers were slain? 
ISA.27.8	You contended with her by banishing her, by driving her away. With His fierce wind He expelled them on the day of the east wind. 
ISA.27.9	So by this will Jacob’s sin be atoned and this the full price to remove his sin: When he makes all the altar stones like shattered chalk stones, so that the Asherah poles and incense rise no more. 
ISA.27.10	The fortified city is a lonely habitation, forlorn and forsaken like the desert. There the calf will graze, there lie down and consume its branches. 
ISA.27.11	When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women come and set them on fire, for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore their Maker will show them no mercy—He who formed them will give them no grace. 
ISA.27.12	It will come about in that day, 
ISA.27.13	It will also come about in that day, a great 
ISA.28.1	 , the proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks! Its glorious beauty is a fading flower, which is at the head of the fertile valleys of those overcome with wine! 
ISA.28.2	Behold, 
ISA.28.3	The proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks will be trampled underfoot. 
ISA.28.4	The glorious beauty is a fading flower which is at the head of the fertile valley, like a first-ripe fig before summer— whoever sees it, swallows it up while it is still in his palm. 
ISA.28.5	In that day 
ISA.28.6	a spirit of judgment for him who sits on the judgment seat, and strength for those turning back the battle at the gate. 
ISA.28.7	But these also reel from wine and stagger from strong drink —the 
ISA.28.8	Since all the tables are full of the filth of vomit, no place is left. 
ISA.28.9	To whom will He teach knowledge? To whom will He explain the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the breast? 
ISA.28.10	For it must be ‘precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little.’ 
ISA.28.11	For through stammering lips and a foreign tongue He will speak to this people, 
ISA.28.12	To whom He said, “Here is rest, give rest to the weary, here is repose”— but they would not listen. 
ISA.28.13	So the word of 
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of 
ISA.28.15	“Because you have said, ‘We cut a covenant with death, we made a pact with 
ISA.28.16	Therefore thus says 
ISA.28.17	But I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line. Hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and water will overflow the hiding place. 
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with death is annulled, and your pact with 
ISA.28.19	 As often as it passes through, it will seize you—morning by morning, by day and by night passing through. It will be sheer terror to understand the message.’” 
ISA.28.20	For too short is the bed to stretch on, too narrow the blanket to wrap up in. 
ISA.28.21	For 
ISA.28.22	So now, stop your scoffing, lest your shackles be strengthened! For I have heard from 
ISA.28.23	Give ear and hear my voice! Pay attention and hear my words. 
ISA.28.24	Does a plowman plow all day to sow the seed? Does he continually break open and harrow his ground? 
ISA.28.25	No! When he has leveled its surface, he scatters dill and sows cumin, plants wheat in rows, places barley, and rye on its border. 
ISA.28.26	For his God teaches him judgment, instructing him. 
ISA.28.27	For dill is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin. Rather, dill is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a rod. 
ISA.28.28	Bread grain is crushed, but not endlessly. Rumbling cart wheels and horses over it would only crush it to powder. 
ISA.28.29	This also comes from 
ISA.29.1	 , Ariel, Ariel! City where David camped. Year to year again—festivals in a cycle. 
ISA.29.2	But I will distress Ariel. There will be lamenting and moaning— then will she be like Ariel to Me? 
ISA.29.3	I will encamp against you all around, I will set up siege-works against you and will raise up ramps against you. 
ISA.29.4	You will be brought low, you will speak from the ground. From the dust where you are prostrate your speech will come. Your voice will be like a ghost out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust. 
ISA.29.5	Yet the multitude of your foes will become like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrifying like chaff that passes away. It will happen in an instant, suddenly. 
ISA.29.6	You will be visited by 
ISA.29.7	It will be like a dream, a night vision: the multitude of all the nations warring against Ariel, yes, all warring against her, the ramparts around her and her besiegers. 
ISA.29.8	It will be like a hungry man dreaming and behold, he is eating, but awakes with his hunger unsatisfied, or like a thirsty man dreaming and behold, he is drinking, but awakes faint, his soul thirsting. So it will be with the multitude of all the nations warring against Mount Zion. 
ISA.29.9	Wait, and be astounded! Blind yourselves, and be blind! Drunk, but not with wine, Stagger, but not with strong drink. 
ISA.29.10	For 
ISA.29.11	So this entire vision is for you like the words of a sealed scroll, which they give to one who knows books, saying, “Read this, please,” but he says, “I can’t, because it’s sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	Then the scroll is given to one who does not know books, saying, “Read this, please,” but he says, “I don’t know books.” 
ISA.29.13	So 
ISA.29.14	Therefore, behold, once more I will do a marvelous work among this people— a marvel and a wonder— so the wisdom of their wise will perish, and the discernment of their discerning will be concealed.” 
ISA.29.15	 , those who go to great depths to hide their plans from 
ISA.29.16	Your perversity! Should the potter be regarded the same as the clay? Should the thing made say to its maker, “You did not make me”? Or the thing formed say of its former, “You have no understanding?” 
ISA.29.17	Will it not be just a very little while before Lebanon turns into a garden, and a garden will seem like a forest? 
ISA.29.18	In that day the deaf will hear words of a book, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. 
ISA.29.19	The meek will add to their joy in 
ISA.29.20	For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished, and all watching to do evil cut off. 
ISA.29.21	Those who make a man out to be guilty with a word, and trap him who reproves at the gate, and deny justice with meaninglessness. 
ISA.29.22	Therefore, thus says 
ISA.29.23	for when he sees his children, the work of My hands in his midst, they will sanctify My Name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and stand in awe of the God of Israel. 
ISA.29.24	Those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will learn instruction.”
ISA.30.1	“
ISA.30.2	who go down to Egypt, but did not consult Me, to take refuge in Pharaoh’s stronghold, to seek shelter in Egypt’s shadow. 
ISA.30.3	Therefore Pharaoh’s stronghold will become your shame, and the shelter in Egypt’s shadow will become your disgrace. 
ISA.30.4	For though their princes are at Zoan and their ambassadors reach Hanes, 
ISA.30.5	they will all be ashamed of a people who cannot profit them. They are neither help nor profit, but shame and disgrace.” 
ISA.30.6	The burden concerning the beasts of the Negev: Through a land of trouble and anguish, in which are lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, they are carrying their riches on the backs of young donkeys, their treasures on camel humps, to a people who cannot profit them. 
ISA.30.7	Egypt’s help is futile and pointless. Therefore I have called her “Rahab who just sits.” 
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it on a tablet for them and inscribe it in a scroll, so that it may be as a witness for the last day, forever. 
ISA.30.9	For this is a rebellious people, lying children, children unwilling to obey the 
ISA.30.10	They say to the seers, “Do not see,” and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right. Speak to us smooth words. Prophesy illusions. 
ISA.30.11	Get out of the way! Turn away from the path! Let’s hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.” 
ISA.30.12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel: “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and rely on perversity, 
ISA.30.13	therefore this sin will be to you like a crack bulging in a high wall, about to fall— its collapse comes suddenly, in an instant! 
ISA.30.14	Its collapse is like smashing a clay jar, so ruthlessly shattered that a shard will not be found among the pieces to take fire from the hearth or scoop water from the cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For thus says 
ISA.30.16	But you said, “No, we will flee on horses!” Therefore you will flee. And, “We will ride on swift horses!” Therefore your pursuers will be swift. 
ISA.30.17	A thousand will flee at the threat of one, at the threat of five you will flee, until you are left like a flag on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill. 
ISA.30.18	Therefore 
ISA.30.19	For the people of Zion who are dwelling in Jerusalem will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. When He hears you, He will answer. 
ISA.30.20	Though 
ISA.30.21	Your ears will hear a word behind you saying: “This is the way, walk in it. When you turn to the right, or when you turn to the left.” 
ISA.30.22	You will defile your graven images overlaid with silver, and your metal images covered with gold. You will throw them away like a menstrual cloth. You will say, “Be gone!” 
ISA.30.23	Then He will give you rain for your seed, which you will sow in the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will feed in wide-open pasture. 
ISA.30.24	The oxen and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 
ISA.30.25	There will be, on every high mountain and on every lofty hill, streams running with water— on a day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter— like the light of seven days— in the day 
ISA.30.27	Look, 
ISA.30.28	His 
ISA.30.29	You will have songs as in the night when you keep a holy festival, and gladness of heart like one walking with the flute to go to the mountain of 
ISA.30.30	 will make His glorious voice heard, and reveal His arm descending with fierce fury in a consuming fire, in cloudburst, rainstorm and hailstones. 
ISA.30.31	For at the voice of 
ISA.30.32	Every stroke of His punishing rod that 
ISA.30.33	For Topheth has long been ready, prepared for the king, its fire pit made deep and wide, a pyre of fire with plenty of wood. The breath of 
ISA.31.1	 , those going down to Egypt for help. They are relying on horses, trusting in chariots since they are many, and in horsemen since they are very mighty, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel nor seek 
ISA.31.2	Yet He is also wise. He brings disaster, and does not take back His words. He rises against the house of evildoers, against help for workers of iniquity. 
ISA.31.3	Now Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses are flesh, not spirit. When 
ISA.31.4	For thus says 
ISA.31.5	Like hovering birds, so 
ISA.31.6	Return to the One from whom rebellion is so deep, 
ISA.31.7	For in that day everyone will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which you made for yourselves with your hands of sin. 
ISA.31.8	“Then Assyria will fall, not by a sword of man, so a sword not of man will devour him and he will flee from the sword. His young men will be put to forced labor. 
ISA.31.9	 His rock will pass away because of fear. His princes will be afraid of the banner” —it is a declaration of 
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king will reign in righteousness and princes will rule in justice. 
ISA.32.2	Each will be like a refuge from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a massive rock in a weary land. 
ISA.32.3	Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, and the ears of those who hear will pay attention. 
ISA.32.4	The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of stammerers will speak fluently, clearly. 
ISA.32.5	No longer will a fool be called noble, or a scoundrel said to be a gentleman. 
ISA.32.6	For the fool speaks foolishness and his heart works wickedness, to practice ungodliness, and speak error about 
ISA.32.7	The scoundrel’s methods are evil— he makes up wicked schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just. 
ISA.32.8	But the noble devises noble plans, and for noble causes he stands. 
ISA.32.9	Rise up, you women at ease, And hear my voice. You complacent daughters, give ear to my words. 
ISA.32.10	Within a year and a few days you will shudder, complacent ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the gathering will not come. 
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you women at ease! Shudder, you complacent ones! Strip and make yourselves bare, and put sackcloth on your waist. 
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts lamenting for pleasant fields, for fruitful vine, 
ISA.32.13	for the land of my people, where thorns and briars come up, for all the joyful houses of the jubilant city. 
ISA.32.14	For the palace will be abandoned; the bustling city will be deserted; the citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, a delight of wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks, 
ISA.32.15	until the 
ISA.32.16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the garden. 
ISA.32.17	The result of righteousness will be 
ISA.32.18	My people will live in a peaceful place, in secure dwellings, quiet resting places. 
ISA.32.19	Then hail will flatten the forest; and the city will be utterly laid low. 
ISA.32.20	Blessed are you, sowing by all waters, letting the feet of the ox and the donkey range free.
ISA.33.1	 , you destroyer, never destroyed, you traitor, never betrayed! When you have stopped destroying, you will be destroyed; and when you finish betraying, they will betray you. 
ISA.33.2	, be gracious to us! We long for You. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of trouble. 
ISA.33.3	From the noise of tumult people will flee; When You lift Yourself up, the nations will be scattered. 
ISA.33.4	Your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; like a swarm of locusts, they are rushing over it. 
ISA.33.5	 is exalted, for He dwells on high! He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. 
ISA.33.6	It will be your time of faithfulness, a wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge— the fear of 
ISA.33.7	Behold, heroes cry outside. Ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. 
ISA.33.8	Highways are desolate; travel has ceased; covenant is broken; cities are despised; there is no regard for humanity. 
ISA.33.9	The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is shamed and withers; Sharon is like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken bare.
ISA.33.10	“Now I will arise,” says 
ISA.33.11	You conceive chaff, you will give birth to stubble. My breath is a fire that will consume you. 
ISA.33.12	Then peoples will be burned as lime, like thorns cut down, burned in the fire. 
ISA.33.13	Hear, you who are afar off, what I have done, and you who are near, acknowledge My might.” 
ISA.33.14	Sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless: “Who among us can live with the consuming fire?” “Who among us can live with everlasting burnings?” 
ISA.33.15	One who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly, who refuses unjust gain by extortion, who shakes his hands free of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, and shuts his eyes from looking on evil. 
ISA.33.16	He will dwell on the heights— his refuge will be an impregnable cliff. His bread will be provided, his water assured. 
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty. They will gaze at a far-distant land. 
ISA.33.18	Your heart will meditate on terror: “Where is the counter?” “Where is the weigher?” “Where is the counter of towers?” 
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see the fierce people, the people of speech too obscure to comprehend, with a stammering tongue no one understands. 
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, city of our Festivals. Your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet home, a tent that will never be folded, Its stakes never pulled up, its cords never broken. 
ISA.33.21	For there the majestic One, 
ISA.33.22	For 
ISA.33.23	Your cords hang slack, not holding the mast in place firmly, nor spreading out the sail. Then abundant spoil will be divided— even the lame will carry off plunder. 
ISA.33.24	No inhabitant will say, “I am sick.” The people dwelling there will be forgiven their iniquity.
ISA.34.1	Draw near, O nations, to hear, and listen, O peoples! Let the earth hear, and all it contains, the world, and all its offspring! 
ISA.34.2	For 
ISA.34.3	So their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise, and the hills will be drenched with their blood. 
ISA.34.4	Then all the host of heaven will dissolve, and the skies will be rolled up like a scroll— so all their array will wither away, like a leaf drooping from a vine, like a fig shriveling from a fig tree.
ISA.34.5	For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens. See, it will come down upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to judgment. 
ISA.34.6	The sword of 
ISA.34.7	Wild oxen will go down with them, bull calves with mighty steers. So their land will be soaked with blood and their dust greasy with fat. 
ISA.34.8	For 
ISA.34.9	Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into brimstone, and its land will become burning tar. 
ISA.34.10	It will not be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will lay waste—forever and ever none will pass through it. 
ISA.34.11	But pelican and porcupine will have it, owl and raven will dwell in it. He will stretch a line of chaos over it and stones of desolation. 
ISA.34.12	As for its nobles, there are none there to call it a kingdom, and all its princes will come to nothing. 
ISA.34.13	Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It will be a haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches. 
ISA.34.14	Wildcats will meet with wolves, the goat-demon will cry to its kind— yes, the night monster will settle there and find itself a resting place. 
ISA.34.15	A tree snake will nest and lay eggs there, hatch and gather them under its shadow. Surely, hawks are gathered there, each one with her mate. 
ISA.34.16	Seek from the scroll of 
ISA.34.17	He cast the lot for them, and His hand divided it out to them with the line. They will possess it forever, and dwell in it from generation to generation. 
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and dry land will be glad. The desert will rejoice and blossom like a lily. 
ISA.35.2	It will blossom profusely, will rejoice with joy and singing, will be given the glory of Lebanon, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of 
ISA.35.3	Strengthen the limp hands, make firm the wobbly knees. 
ISA.35.4	Say to those with anxious heart, “Be strong, have no fear!” Behold, your God! Vengeance is coming! God’s recompense—it is coming! Then He will save you. 
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 
ISA.35.6	Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing. For water will burst forth in the desert and streams in the wilderness. 
ISA.35.7	The parched land will become a pool, the thirsty ground springs of water. In the haunt of jackals, where they rest, grass will become reeds and rushes. 
ISA.35.8	A highway will be there—a roadway. It will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it. It is for the one who walks the way. Fools will not go astray. 
ISA.35.9	No lion will be there. No ravenous beast will go up on it. They will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk there. 
ISA.35.10	The ransomed of 
ISA.36.1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that King Sennacherib of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
ISA.36.2	The king of Assyria sent the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a massive army. The Rab-shakeh stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool in the highway of the washer’s field. 
ISA.36.3	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came out to him. 
ISA.36.4	So the Rab-shakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: ‘What is this confidence you’ve relied on? 
ISA.36.5	I say your strategy and strength for war are only words of a lip. Who do you rely on now, so that you have rebelled against me? 
ISA.36.6	Behold, you rely on this splintered reed as a staff—Egypt! If a man leans on it, it will go into the palm of his hand and pierce it—thus Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him. 
ISA.36.7	“‘But if you say to me: ‘We trust in 
ISA.36.8	“So now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,ooo horses—if you could put riders of your own on them. 
ISA.36.9	So, how can you repulse a single lieutenant—the least of my master’s servants? Yes, you’re relying on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen. 
ISA.36.10	“Moreover, have I now come up against this land to destroy it without 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh: “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the language of the Jews when the people on the wall are listening.” 
ISA.36.12	But the Rab-shakeh said: “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall—who will eat their own waste and drink their own urine with you?” 
ISA.36.13	Then the Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the language of the Jews and said: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
ISA.36.14	Thus says the king: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you! 
ISA.36.15	Nor let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in 
ISA.36.16	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah! For thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace with me and come out to me. Then everyone will eat from his own vine and fig tree, and everyone will drink water from his own cistern, 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land—a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.’ 
ISA.36.18	“Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, ‘
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, when did they deliver Samaria from my hand? 
ISA.36.20	Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their country out of my hand? So will 
ISA.36.21	But they were silent, and did not answer him a word, for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” 
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rab-shakeh. 
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the House of 
ISA.37.2	Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe and the senior 
ISA.37.3	Then they said to him: “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, rebuke and contempt. For children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength for giving birth. 
ISA.37.4	Perhaps 
ISA.37.5	When the officials of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them: “Thus you will say to your master, ‘Thus says 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I am putting a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor, and will return to his own country; then I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’” 
ISA.37.8	Then the Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard he had withdrawn from Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	Now he had heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, saying: “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah saying: 
ISA.37.10	“Thus you will say to King Hezekiah of Judah, saying, do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying: ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ 
ISA.37.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands—utterly destroying them—so will you be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered those my fathers destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, or the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, or the king of Arpad, or the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, or Ivvah?’” 
ISA.37.14	Then Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the House of 
ISA.37.15	Hezekiah prayed to 
ISA.37.16	“
ISA.37.17	Incline Your ear, 
ISA.37.18	It is true, 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire—for they were not gods, but the work of human hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. 
ISA.37.20	Now, 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah saying, “Thus says 
ISA.37.22	this is the word that 
ISA.37.23	Whom did you taunt and blaspheme? Against whom did you raise your voice and haughtily lift up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! 
ISA.37.24	Through your servants, you have blasphemed my Lord and said: ‘With my many chariots I have climbed to the heights of the mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon! I cut down its tall cedars and choice cypress trees. I have gone to its farthest peak, its thickest forest. 
ISA.37.25	I dug and drank water, and with the sole of my feet, I dried up all the streams of Egypt.’ 
ISA.37.26	Have you not heard? I did it long ago! From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass— that you should turn fortified cities into heaps of rubble. 
ISA.37.27	Their inhabitants are weak handed, shattered and ashamed. They are like the grass of the field and green herb, like grass on roofs, scorched before it is grown up. 
ISA.37.28	But I know your sitting down, your going out and your coming in, and your raging against Me. 
ISA.37.29	Because your raging against Me and your arrogance reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way that you came.” 
ISA.37.30	So this shall be the sign to you: This year you will eat what grows by itself, in the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, you will sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
ISA.37.31	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
ISA.37.32	For from Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus says 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come into this city” —it is a declaration of 
ISA.37.35	“For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.” 
ISA.37.36	Then the angel of 
ISA.37.37	So King Sennacherib of Assyria withdrew, and returned home, and stayed in Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	It also came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, that his sons Adrammelech and Sarezer struck him down with the sword, and escaped into the land of Ararat. Then his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. So Isaiah the prophet son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to 
ISA.38.3	He said: “Please, 
ISA.38.4	Then it came to pass, the word of 
ISA.38.5	“Go, and say to Hezekiah, thus says 
ISA.38.6	I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city.’ 
ISA.38.7	“Now this will be the sign to you from 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will cause the shadow on the stairs, which went down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, to turn back ten steps.” So the sun’s shadow went back ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down. 
ISA.38.9	A writing of King Hezekiah of Judah, after his illness, when he recovered from his illness: 
ISA.38.10	I said: “In the prime of my life, I am to enter the gates of 
ISA.38.11	I said: “I will not see 
ISA.38.12	Like a shepherd’s tent, my dwelling is pulled up and carried away from me. Like a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom. From day until night You make my end. 
ISA.38.13	I stilled my soul till morning. Like a lion, He will break all my bones. From day till night You make my end. 
ISA.38.14	Like a swallow or a crane, I whisper, I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary, looking upward. 
ISA.38.15	What should I say? For He has spoken to me— He Himself has done it! I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. 
ISA.38.16	, by such things men live, and my spirit has life in them too. Restore me to health, and let me live! 
ISA.38.17	Behold, it was for my own 
ISA.38.18	For 
ISA.38.19	The living, the living—they praise You— as I do today. A father makes Your faithfulness known to his children. 
ISA.38.20	 will save me. So we will play my songs on stringed instruments all the days of our life in the House of 
ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, and he will live.” 
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the House of 
ISA.39.1	At that time Merodach-baladan, son of King Baladan of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 
ISA.39.2	Now Hezekiah was pleased with them, so he showed them his treasure house—the silver and the gold, the spices and the precious oil—and his whole armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah replied, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.” 
ISA.39.4	Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah said, “They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my treasuries that I didn’t show them.” 
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah: “Hear the word of 
ISA.39.6	‘Behold, days are coming when everything in your house, which your fathers have stored up to this day, will be carried to Babylon—nothing will be left,’ says 
ISA.39.7	‘Moreover, some of your descendants—who will issue from you, whom you will father—will be taken away and will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” 
ISA.39.8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of 
ISA.40.1	“Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God. 
ISA.40.2	Speak kindly to the heart of Jerusalem and proclaim to her that her warfare has ended, that her iniquity has been removed. For she has received from 
ISA.40.3	A voice cries out in the wilderness, “Prepare the way of 
ISA.40.4	Every valley will be lifted up, every mountain and hill made low, the rough ground will be a plain and the rugged terrain smooth. 
ISA.40.5	The glory of 
ISA.40.6	A voice is saying, “Cry out!” So I said, “What shall I cry out?” “All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field. 
ISA.40.7	The grass withers, the flower fades. For the breath of 
ISA.40.8	The grass withers, the flower fades. But the word of our God stands forever.” 
ISA.40.9	Get yourself up on a high mountain, you who bring good news to Zion! Lift up your voice with strength, you who bring good news to Jerusalem! Lift it up! Do not fear! Say to the cities of Judah: “Behold your God!” 
ISA.40.10	Look, 
ISA.40.11	Like a shepherd, He tends His flock. He gathers the lambs in His arms carries them in his bosom, and gently guides nursing ewes. 
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the palm of His hand, or measured out heaven with a span, or calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, or weighed the mountains in scales, or the hills in a balance? 
ISA.40.13	Who can fathom the 
ISA.40.14	With whom did He consult, and who instructed Him? Who taught Him in the path of justice or taught Him knowledge? Who informed Him about the way of understanding? 
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and count as a speck of dust on the scales. Behold, the islands weigh as fine dust. 
ISA.40.16	Lebanon is not enough to burn, or its animals enough for a burnt offering. 
ISA.40.17	All the nations are as nothing before Him. By Him they are accounted null and void. 
ISA.40.18	To whom then will you liken God? To what likeness will you compare Him? 
ISA.40.19	To an idol? A craftsman casts it, a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it. 
ISA.40.20	One too poor for such an offering chooses wood that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to prepare him an idol that will not totter. 
ISA.40.21	Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
ISA.40.22	He sits above the circle of the earth— its inhabitants are like grasshoppers— He stretches out the skies like a curtain, spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. 
ISA.40.23	He reduces princes to nothing. He makes the judges of the earth a confusion. 
ISA.40.24	Scarcely are they planted, scarcely are they sown, scarcely their stem takes root in the earth, when He blows on them and they wither, and a storm carries them off as stubble. 
ISA.40.25	“To whom then will you liken Me? Or who is My equal?” says the Holy One. 
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high, and see! Who created these? The One who brings out their host by number, the One who calls them all by name. Because of His great strength and vast power, not one is missing. 
ISA.40.27	Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, “My way is hidden from 
ISA.40.28	Have you not known? Have you not heard? 
ISA.40.29	He gives strength to the weary, and to one without vigor He adds might. 
ISA.40.30	Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall, 
ISA.40.31	but they who wait for 
ISA.41.1	“Be silent before Me, O islands! Let peoples renew their strength. Let them draw near, then let them speak. Let us come together for judgment. 
ISA.41.2	Who has stirred up one from the east? He calls justice to His feet. He gives nations over to him and subdues kings. He makes them like dust with his sword, as driven stubble with his bow. 
ISA.41.3	He pursues them, passing on safely, by a path his feet had not traveled. 
ISA.41.4	Who has performed and done it? Calling forth the generations from the beginning, I, 
ISA.41.5	The coastlands have seen and fear. The ends of the earth tremble. They draw near and come. 
ISA.41.6	Each one helps his neighbor and says to his brother, “Be strong!” 
ISA.41.7	The craftsman encourages the smith, who smooths with the hammer, who strikes with the anvil, saying of the soldering, “It’s good!” as he fastens it with nails so that it will not totter.
ISA.41.8	“But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham, My friend— 
ISA.41.9	I took hold of you from the ends of the earth, and called from its uttermost parts, and said to you, ‘You are My servant— I have chosen you, not rejected you. 
ISA.41.10	Fear not, for I am with you, be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Surely I will help you. I will uphold you with My righteous right hand. 
ISA.41.11	Behold, all who were angry at you will be ashamed and disgraced. Those who quarrel with you will be as nothing and perish. 
ISA.41.12	Though you will look for those who contended with you, you will not find them. Those who warred against you will be as nothing at all. 
ISA.41.13	For I am 
ISA.41.14	Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you.” It is a declaration of 
ISA.41.15	“Look, I will make you a threshing sledge, new, with sharp, double-edged spikes. You will thresh the mountains and grind them up, and will make the hills like chaff. 
ISA.41.16	You will winnow them, and a wind will carry them away, a storm-wind will scatter them. But you will rejoice in 
ISA.41.17	“The poor and needy ask for water, but there is none, Their tongues are parched with thirst. I, 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers on the bare hills and springs in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land into fountains of water. 
ISA.41.19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia tree, the myrtle and the olive tree. I will set in the desert the cypress tree and the pine together with the box tree— 
ISA.41.20	so they may see and know, consider and understand together, that the hand of 
ISA.41.21	“Present your case,” says 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring forth and tell us what will happen. The former things, what were they? Tell us, that we may consider them and know their outcome. Or announce to us things to come. 
ISA.41.23	Declare the things coming afterward, so we may know that you are gods! Indeed, do good or do evil, so we may all see and be awestruck. 
ISA.41.24	Behold, you are nothing, and your work is null. Whoever chooses you is loathsome. 
ISA.41.25	“I have stirred up one from the north, and he has come. From the rising of the sun, He will call upon My Name. He will trample rulers as on mortar, like a potter treading clay.” 
ISA.41.26	Who told this from the beginning, so that we may know? Or from former times, so we may say, “He is right”? In fact, no one foretold it, In fact, no one announced it. In fact, no one heard Your words. 
ISA.41.27	First it was to Zion: “Behold, here they are!” And to Jerusalem: “I will give a herald of good news.” 
ISA.41.28	But when I look, there is no one. There is no counselor among them. When I ask them, they have no response. 
ISA.41.29	Indeed, they are all a delusion. Their works are null. Their molten images are wind and waste.
ISA.42.1	Behold My servant, whom I uphold. My Chosen One, in whom My soul delights. I have put My 
ISA.42.2	He will not cry out or raise His voice, or make His voice heard in the street. 
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed He will not break. A smoldering wick He will not snuff out. He will faithfully bring forth justice. 
ISA.42.4	He will not be disheartened or crushed until He establishes justice on earth. The islands will wait for His 
ISA.42.5	Thus says God, 
ISA.42.6	“I, 
ISA.42.7	by opening blind eyes, bringing prisoners out of the dungeon, and those sitting in darkness out of the prison house. 
ISA.42.8	“I am 
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I declare new things. Before they spring forth I announce them to you.” 
ISA.42.10	Sing to 
ISA.42.11	Let the desert and its cities exult— the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the dwellers of Sela sing for joy. Let them shout for joy from the top of the mountains. 
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory to 
ISA.42.13	 goes out as a mighty one. He stirs up His zeal like a man of war. He will shout, yes, raise a war cry! He will prevail over His enemies. 
ISA.42.14	“I have held My peace a long time, I have been still and restrained Myself. Now like a woman in labor I groan, gasping and panting at once. 
ISA.42.15	I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation. I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools. 
ISA.42.16	I will bring the blind by a way they do not know. in paths they have not known, I will guide them. I will turn darkness before them to light and the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them. 
ISA.42.17	They will be turned back, utterly put to shame— those trusting in idols, who say to molten images, ‘You are our gods.’ 
ISA.42.18	Hear, you deaf! Look, you blind, so you may see. 
ISA.42.19	Who is blind, but My Servant? Or deaf as My Messenger that I send? Who is so blind as the one in covenant with Me, blind as 
ISA.42.20	You have seen many things, but you do not pay attention. Though ears are open, no one hears.” 
ISA.42.21	 was pleased, for the sake of His righteousness, to make 
ISA.42.22	But this is a people robbed and looted. all of them trapped in holes, hidden away in prisons. They have become a prey with no one to deliver them, and plunder, with none to say, “Give them back!” 
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this? Who will listen and heed hereafter? 
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob to the looter, Israel to the plunderers? Was it not 
ISA.42.25	So He poured out on him the fury of His anger, and the fierceness of battle. it blazed all around him, yet he did not understand it. it burned him, yet he did not take it to heart. 
ISA.43.1	But now, thus says 
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, or through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, nor will the flame burn you. 
ISA.43.3	For I am 
ISA.43.4	Since you are precious in My eyes, honored, because I love you, I will give a man in exchange for you, and other peoples for your life. 
ISA.43.5	Do not fear, for I am with you. I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west. 
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’ Bring My sons from far and My daughters from the ends of the earth. 
ISA.43.7	Everyone who is called by My Name, whom I created for My glory. I formed him—yes, I made him!”
ISA.43.8	Bring out the people who are blind, yet have eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears. 
ISA.43.9	All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are assembled. Who among them can declare this, and proclaim to us former things? Let them present their witnesses so they may be justified, or let them hear and say, “It’s true.” 
ISA.43.10	“You are My witnesses” —it is a declaration of 
ISA.43.11	“I, I am 
ISA.43.12	I alone declared, saved and proclaimed, and not some foreign god among you. So you are My witnesses” —it is a declaration of 
ISA.43.13	From eternity, I am He. None can deliver from My hand. I act, and who can reverse it?” 
ISA.43.14	Thus says 
ISA.43.15	I am 
ISA.43.16	Thus says 
ISA.43.17	who drew out chariots and horses, the army and the warrior (they will lie down together, and not rise again; they are extinguished— quenched like a wick): 
ISA.43.18	“Do not remember former things, nor consider things of the past. 
ISA.43.19	Here I am, doing a new thing; Now it is springing up— do you not know about it? I will surely make a way in the desert, rivers in the wasteland. 
ISA.43.20	The field animals honor Me —the jackals and the ostriches— because I give waters in the desert, rivers in the wilderness, to give drink to My chosen people, 
ISA.43.21	the people I formed for Myself, so they might declare My praise. 
ISA.43.22	Yet you have not called on Me, Jacob, for you have been weary of Me, Israel. 
ISA.43.23	You have not brought Me sheep for your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I did not compel you to serve offerings nor wearied you with incense. 
ISA.43.24	You have not spent money buying Me aromatic cane, nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. Rather you burdened Me with your sins, wearied Me with your iniquities. 
ISA.43.25	I, I am the One who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and will not remember your sins. 
ISA.43.26	Remind me, when we argue our case together—state your case, so you may be proved right. 
ISA.43.27	Your first father sinned, and your mediators rebelled against Me. 
ISA.43.28	So I profaned the Sanctuary officials, and gave Jacob over to destruction, and Israel to scorn.
ISA.44.1	“But now listen, Jacob My servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.” 
ISA.44.2	Thus says 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground. I will pour My Spirit on your offspring, and My blessing on your descendants. 
ISA.44.4	They will spring up among the grass like willows by flowing streams. 
ISA.44.5	This one will say, ‘I am 
ISA.44.6	Thus says 
ISA.44.7	Who is like Me? Let him proclaim and announce it! Let him arrange it in order for Me— as I established the ancient nation. Let them declare to them what is coming and future events. 
ISA.44.8	Do not dread or be afraid. Have I not told you and declared it long ago? So you are My witnesses! Is there any God beside Me? Is there any other Rock? I know of none.
ISA.44.9	Those who fashion idols are empty. Their precious things do not profit. Their witnesses do not see or know, so they will be put to shame. 
ISA.44.10	Who fashions a god or casts an idol for no profit? 
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his friends will be ashamed, for the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble. Let them stand up. Let them dread. Let them be put to shame together. 
ISA.44.12	The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it over the coals, fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm. Yet when he is hungry, his strength fails. When he drinks no water, he gets tired. 
ISA.44.13	A carpenter stretches out a line; he marks it with a pencil; he shapes it with planes; he marks it with a compass; he shapes it like the figure of a man —like the beauty of a man— so that it may sit in a shrine. 
ISA.44.14	He chops down cedars for himself, or he takes a cypress or an oak. He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a pine and rain nourishes it. 
ISA.44.15	Then it is something for a man to burn. so he takes one of them and warms himself. He also makes a fire to bake bread. He also makes a god and worships it. He makes an idol and bows before it. 
ISA.44.16	He burns half of it in the fire. With this half, he eats meat. He roasts a roast and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire.” 
ISA.44.17	Yet with the rest he makes a god, his carved image. He falls down before it and worships. He even prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!” 
ISA.44.18	They do not know or understand! For He smeared over their eyes, so they cannot see, and their hearts, so they cannot understand. 
ISA.44.19	No one reflects in his heart, with no knowledge or discernment to say, “I burned half of it in the fire and I also baked bread on its coals. I roasted meat and ate—and then I make the rest of it an abomination? Should I bow before a block of wood?” 
ISA.44.20	He is feeding on ashes. A deceived heart has led him astray, so he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, “Isn’t what is in my right hand a fraud?” 
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, for you are My servant. I formed you, you are My servant. Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me! 
ISA.44.22	I have blotted out your transgressions like a thick cloud and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” 
ISA.44.23	Sing, O heavens, for 
ISA.44.24	Thus says 
ISA.44.25	causing the omens of boasters to fail, making fools of diviners, turning wise men backward and making their knowledge foolish, 
ISA.44.26	while confirming the word of His servant, fulfilling the counsel of His messengers, saying of Jerusalem, “She will be lived in” and of the cities of Judah, “They will be built, and I will raise up their ruins,” 
ISA.44.27	while saying to the deep, “Be dry, I will dry up your rivers,” 
ISA.44.28	while saying of Cyrus, “He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all My purpose” while saying to Jerusalem, “You will be built” and to the Temple, “Your foundation will be laid.” 
ISA.45.1	Thus says 
ISA.45.2	I will go before you and make crooked places straight. I will shatter bronze doors and cut through iron bars. 
ISA.45.3	I will give you treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, so you may know that I am 
ISA.45.4	For the sake of Jacob My servant, and Israel My chosen one, I have also called you by name, I have given you a title of honor, though you have not known Me. 
ISA.45.5	I am 
ISA.45.6	so they may know, from the rising to the setting of the sun, that there is no one besides Me. I am 
ISA.45.7	I form light and create darkness. I make 
ISA.45.8	“Rain down, O heavens, from above, and let the clouds pour down justice. Let the earth open up, let salvation sprout, and righteousness spring up with it. I, 
ISA.45.9	 , to one who quarrels with his Maker, like a pot among the pots of the earth! Shall the clay say to the potter, “What have you made?” Or does your work say, “It has no handles”? 
ISA.45.10	 , to him who says to his father, “What have you begotten?” Or to a woman, “What have you born?” 
ISA.45.11	Thus says 
ISA.45.12	I made the earth and created man on it. My hands stretched out the heavens and I commanded all their host. 
ISA.45.13	“I stirred Cyrus up in righteousness and I will level all his roads. He will build My city and set My exiles free, with no price or bribe,” says 
ISA.45.14	Thus says 
ISA.45.15	Truly You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, Savior! 
ISA.45.16	All of them will be ashamed, disgraced— idol-makers go in dishonor together. 
ISA.45.17	Israel has been saved by 
ISA.45.18	For thus says 
ISA.45.19	“I have not spoken in secret, in a place of a land of darkness. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, ‘Seek Me in desolation.’ I, 
ISA.45.20	“Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, fugitives of the nations! Those who carry their wooden idols have no knowledge, praying to a god who cannot save. 
ISA.45.21	Declare and present your case, Indeed, let them consult together. Who foretold this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Is it not I, 
ISA.45.22	Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth. For I am God—there is no other. 
ISA.45.23	By Myself I have sworn— the word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness, and is irrevocable: that to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear. 
ISA.45.24	They will say of Me, ‘Only in 
ISA.45.25	In 
ISA.46.1	Bel bows down; Nebo stoops over. Their idols are for beasts and cattle. The things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts. 
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they bow down together, they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity. 
ISA.46.3	“Listen to Me, house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, borne by Me from birth, carried from the womb. 
ISA.46.4	Even to your old age I will be the same, until you are gray I will carry you. I have done it; I will bear you; I will carry you; I will deliver you. 
ISA.46.5	To whom will you liken Me, or make Me equal or compare Me, that we should be alike? 
ISA.46.6	They lavish gold from a purse and weigh out silver on the scales. They hire a goldsmith so he makes a god. They bow down. Yes, they worship it. 
ISA.46.7	They lift it upon a shoulder and carry it. They set in its place and there it stands. It does not budge from its place. Even if one cry to it, it cannot answer, nor save anyone from his trouble.”
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, and be assured. Recall it to mind, you transgressors. 
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old: For I am God—there is no other. I am God, and there is none like Me— 
ISA.46.10	declaring the end from the beginning, from ancient time, what is yet to come, saying, “My purpose will stand, and I will accomplish all that I please.” 
ISA.46.11	From the east I am calling a bird of prey, a man for My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; I will bring it to pass; I have planned it; surely I will do it. 
ISA.46.12	Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness: 
ISA.46.13	I bring My justice near, it is not far off. So My salvation will not delay. I put salvation in Zion, My glory in Israel.”
ISA.47.1	Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon. Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will no more be called tender and delicate. 
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones and grind flour. Remove your veil, strip off the skirt, uncover the leg, cross the rivers. 
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness will be uncovered, and your shame will be exposed. I will take vengeance, and will spare no one. 
ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer, 
ISA.47.5	Sit in silence, go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will no more be called the mistress-queen of kingdoms. 
ISA.47.6	I was angry with My people. I profaned My heritage. I gave them into your hand, but you showed them no mercy. You made your yoke very heavy on the aged. 
ISA.47.7	You said, “Forever, I will be the eternal mistress-queen!” You did not lay these things to heart or remember their end. 
ISA.47.8	Now then, hear this, voluptuous one, dwelling securely, saying in your heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me! I will not sit as a widow, or know the loss of children,” 
ISA.47.9	These two things will come upon you in a moment, in one day— loss of children and widowhood— they will come upon you in full measure in spite of your many sorceries and your many spells. 
ISA.47.10	You felt secure in your wickedness, You said, “No one sees me.” Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, so you have said in your heart, “I am—there is no one else beside me!” 
ISA.47.11	But calamity will come upon you. You won’t know how to charm it away. Disaster will fall on you, for which you cannot atone. Catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you. 
ISA.47.12	Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, which you have toiled over since your youth. Perhaps you will succeed? Perhaps you will cause terror? 
ISA.47.13	You are weary of your consultations. So many! So let the astrologers, star-gazers, predicting by new moons, stand up and save you from what will come upon you. 
ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble. Fire will consume them. They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame! It is not a coal for warming by or a fire to sit before! 
ISA.47.15	So much have they become to you, with whom you have toiled, trafficking with you from your youth, each wandering about his own way. No one will save you! 
ISA.48.1	Hear this, house of Jacob, who are called by the Name of Israel, who came from the wellspring of Judah, who swear by the Name of 
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves by the holy city, and lean on the God of Israel, 
ISA.48.3	“I foretold the former things long ago. They went forth from My mouth, and I caused them to be heard. Suddenly I acted, so they came about. 
ISA.48.4	For I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is iron sinew, and your forehead bronze. 
ISA.48.5	So I foretold it to you long ago. before it came about I made you hear, lest you should say, ‘My idol did them, my carved image, yes, my molded image commanded them.’ 
ISA.48.6	You have heard. See all of it. So will you not admit it? I proclaim to you new things from now on—hidden things that you have not known. 
ISA.48.7	They are created now, not long ago. Before today you had not heard them. So you will not say, ‘Sure, I knew them.’ 
ISA.48.8	You have not heard; you never knew; even from long ago your ear has not been open. For I knew that you are treacherous, and from birth were called a rebel. 
ISA.48.9	For My Name’s sake I defer My anger, for My praise I will restrain it for you— otherwise I would cut you off. 
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined you, though not as silver. I tested you in the furnace of affliction. 
ISA.48.11	For My own sake, for My own sake, I act. For how should I be profaned? I will not give My glory to another. 
ISA.48.12	Listen to Me, Jacob, Israel whom I called: I am He; I am the first; I am also the last. 
ISA.48.13	Surely My hand founded the earth, My right hand spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand together. 
ISA.48.14	Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them foretold these things? 
ISA.48.15	I, I have spoken, yes I called him. I will bring him, so his ways will succeed. 
ISA.48.16	Draw near to Me, hear this: Since the beginning, I have not spoken in secret. From the time it existed, I was there. So now 
ISA.48.17	Thus says 
ISA.48.18	If only you had listened to My commandments! then your peace would be like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. 
ISA.48.19	Your seed would have been like sand, and your offspring like its grains. Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before Me.” 
ISA.48.20	“Get out of Babylon, flee from Chaldea! With a shout of joy, proclaim this, send it out to the end of the earth, say: ‘
ISA.48.21	They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He caused the water to flow out of the rock for them. He split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.’” 
ISA.48.22	“There is no 
ISA.49.1	Listen, to Me, islands! Pay attention, peoples far away. 
ISA.49.2	He made My mouth like a sharp sword. in the shadow of His hand He hid Me. He made Me a polished arrow, He has hidden Me in His quiver. 
ISA.49.3	He said to Me, “You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” 
ISA.49.4	But I said, “I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and futility. Yet surely the justice due to me is with 
ISA.49.5	So now says 
ISA.49.6	So He says, “It is too trifling a thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore the preserved ones of Israel. So I will give You as a light for the nations, that You should be My salvation to the end of the earth.” 
ISA.49.7	Thus says 
ISA.49.8	Thus says 
ISA.49.9	saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’ to those in darkness, ‘Be shown!’ Along the roads they will graze— their pasture will be on all the barren heights. 
ISA.49.10	They will not hunger or thirst, nor scorching wind or sun strike them, for their compassionate One will lead them, and will guide them by springs of water. 
ISA.49.11	I will make all My mountains a road, and My highways will be raised up. 
ISA.49.12	“Behold, these shall come from afar. behold, these from the north and from the west, and from the land of Sinim. 
ISA.49.13	Shout for joy, heavens! Rejoice, earth! Break forth into ringing shouts, O mountains! For 
ISA.49.14	But Zion said: “
ISA.49.15	“Can a woman forget her nursing baby or lack compassion for a child of her womb? Even if these forget, I will not forget you. 
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands. Your walls are continually before Me. 
ISA.49.17	Your children will come quickly. Your destroyers and devastators will go away from you. 
ISA.49.18	Lift up your eyes around and see: all of them will gather and come to you.” “As I live” —it is 
ISA.49.19	For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land will now be surely too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away. 
ISA.49.20	The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears, “The place is too cramped for me! Make room for me to settle in.” 
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your heart, “Who has borne these for me? Wasn’t I bereaved of my children— barren, an exile and wandering? So who has raised these? Behold, I was left alone— these, where were they?” 
ISA.49.22	Thus says 
ISA.49.23	Kings will be your guardians, their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you with their face to the ground, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am 
ISA.49.24	Can plunder be taken from the mighty, or captives of the righteous freed? 
ISA.49.25	For thus says 
ISA.49.26	I will feed your oppressors their flesh. They will be drunk with their blood as with sweet wine. Then all flesh will know that I, 
ISA.50.1	Thus says 
ISA.50.2	Why was no one there when I came? Why was there no one to answer when I called? Is My hand too short to redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, I dry up the sea at My rebuke, I make rivers a wilderness— their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst. 
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their covering.”
ISA.50.4	 has given Me the tongue of the learned, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning. He awakens My ear to give heed as a disciple. 
ISA.50.5	 has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn back. 
ISA.50.6	I gave My back to those who strike, and My cheeks to those pulling out My beard; I did not hide My face from humiliation and spitting. 
ISA.50.7	For 
ISA.50.8	The One who vindicates Me is near. Who will accuse Me? Let us stand up to each other. Who is My adversary? Let him confront Me. 
ISA.50.9	See, 
ISA.50.10	Who among you fears 
ISA.50.11	“Behold, all you who kindle a fire, encircling yourselves with firebrands. Walk in the light of your fire and among the brands you have lit. This you will have from My hand: you will lie down in torment.”
ISA.51.1	“Listen to Me, you who pursue justice, you who seek 
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you. For when I called him, he was but one, then I blessed him and multiplied him.” 
ISA.51.3	For 
ISA.51.4	“Pay attention to Me, My people, give ear to Me, My nation. For 
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone out, and My arms will judge the nations. The coastlands will wait for Me— for My arm they will wait expectantly. 
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath. For the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and its inhabitants will die like gnats, but My salvation will be forever, and My righteousness never wane. 
ISA.51.7	Listen to Me, you who know justice, a people with My 
ISA.51.8	For the moth will eat them like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool. But My righteousness will be forever and My salvation for all generations.” 
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of 
ISA.51.10	Was it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a path for the redeemed to pass over? 
ISA.51.11	Now the ransomed of 
ISA.51.12	“I, I am the One who comforts you. Who are you that you should fear man, who dies, or a son of man, who is given up like grass?” 
ISA.51.13	But you forgot 
ISA.51.14	Soon one bowed down will be released. He will not die and go to the Pit, nor will his bread be lacking. 
ISA.51.15	“For I am 
ISA.51.16	I have put My words in your mouth, and covered you with the shadow of My hand— I who set the heavens in place, who laid the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, ‘You are My people.’” 
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake! Stand up, Jerusalem! From 
ISA.51.18	There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne, nor is there one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has raised. 
ISA.51.19	These two things have befallen you —who will mourn for you?— devastation and destruction, famine and the sword. How will I comfort you? 
ISA.51.20	Your sons have fainted. They lie at every street corner, like an antelope in a net. They are full of 
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted, who are drunk, but not with wine. 
ISA.51.22	Thus says your Lord, 
ISA.51.23	Then I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we may walk over you.’ You have made your back like the ground and like a street for passersby. 
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake! Clothe yourself in your strength, Zion! Clothe yourself in beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city, for the uncircumcised and the unclean will never invade you again. 
ISA.52.2	Shake off the dust and arise! Be enthroned, Jerusalem. Loose the bonds off your neck, captive Daughter of Zion. 
ISA.52.3	For thus says 
ISA.52.4	For thus says 
ISA.52.5	“Now therefore, what do I have here?” —it is a declaration of 
ISA.52.6	Therefore My people will know My Name. Therefore in that day, I am the One who will be saying, ‘
ISA.52.7	How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who announces 
ISA.52.8	The voice of your watchmen— they will lift up their voices. Together they are shouting for joy! For they will see eye to eye when 
ISA.52.9	Break forth in joy, sing together, you ruins of Jerusalem, for 
ISA.52.10	 has bared His holy arm before the eyes of all the nations. All the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God. 
ISA.52.11	Leave, leave! Get out of there! Touch no unclean thing. Go out of her midst. Purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of 
ISA.52.12	For you will not go out in haste, nor will you go in flight, for 
ISA.52.13	“Behold, My servant will prosper, He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted. 
ISA.52.14	Just as many were appalled at You— His appearance was disfigured more than any man, His form more than the sons of men. 
ISA.52.15	So He will sprinkle many nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of Him, for what had not been told them they will see, and what they had not heard they will perceive.
ISA.53.1	‘Who has believed our report? To whom is the arm of 
ISA.53.2	For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, like a root out of dry ground. He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him, nor beauty that we should desire Him. 
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, One from whom people hide their faces. He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. 
ISA.53.4	Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our pains. Yet we esteemed Him stricken, struck by God, and afflicted. 
ISA.53.5	But He was pierced because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities. The chastisement for our 
ISA.53.6	We all like sheep have gone astray. Each of us turned to his own way. So 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and He was afflicted yet He did not open His mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter, like a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He did not open His mouth. 
ISA.53.8	Because of oppression and judgment He was taken away. As for His generation, who considered? For He was cut off from the land of the living, for the transgression of my people— the stroke was theirs 
ISA.53.9	His grave was given with the wicked, and by a rich man in His death, though He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth. 
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased 
ISA.53.11	As a result of the anguish of His soul He will see it and be satisfied by His knowledge. The Righteous One, My Servant will make many righteous and He will bear their iniquities. 
ISA.53.12	Therefore I will give Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the spoil with the mighty— because He poured out His soul to death, and was counted with transgressors. For He bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	“Sing, barren one, who has not given birth. burst into singing and shout, you who have not travailed. For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married one,” says 
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch out your tabernacle curtains. Do not hold back— lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes. 
ISA.54.3	For you will spread out to the right hand and to the left. Your offspring will possess the nations and will resettle the desolate cities. 
ISA.54.4	Fear not, for you will not be ashamed. Nor cringe, for you will not be disgraced. For you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will remember the reproach of your widowhood no more. 
ISA.54.5	For your Maker is your husband —
ISA.54.6	“For 
ISA.54.7	“For a brief moment I deserted you, but I will regather you with great compassion. 
ISA.54.8	In a surge of anger I hid My face from you a moment, but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you,” says 
ISA.54.9	“For this is like the waters of Noah to Me: for as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more cover the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor will I rebuke you. 
ISA.54.10	Though the mountains depart and the hills be shaken, My love will not depart from you, nor will My covenant of peace be shaken, says 
ISA.54.11	Afflicted one, storm-tossed, unconsoled, behold, I set your stones in antimony, lay your foundations with sapphires, 
ISA.54.12	make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates of crystal, and all your walls of precious stones. 
ISA.54.13	All your children will be taught by 
ISA.54.14	“In righteousness you will be established. You will be far from oppression —for you will not fear— and from terror— for it will not come near you. 
ISA.54.15	Behold, anyone fiercely attacking is not from Me. Whoever stirs up strife with you will fall because of you. 
ISA.54.16	Behold, I created the smith who blows the fire of coals and produces a weapon for its work, and I created the destroyer to ruin. 
ISA.54.17	No weapon formed against you will prosper and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of 
ISA.55.1	“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the water, and you who have no money, come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost! 
ISA.55.2	Why do you spend money for what is not bread? Your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen diligently to Me, and eat what is good, and delight yourself in abundance. 
ISA.55.3	Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, so that your soul may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the trustworthy loyalty to David. 
ISA.55.4	Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples. 
ISA.55.5	Behold, you will summon a nation you do not know, and a nation that did not know you will run to you, because of 
ISA.55.6	Seek 
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous one his thoughts, let him return to 
ISA.55.8	“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways.” It is a declaration of 
ISA.55.9	“For as the heavens are higher than earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts. 
ISA.55.10	For as the rain and snow come down from heaven, and do not return there without having watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to sow and bread to eat, 
ISA.55.11	so My word will be that goes out from My mouth. It will not return to Me in vain, but will accomplish what I intend, and will succeed in what I sent it for. 
ISA.55.12	“Yes, you will go out with joy and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills will break forth before you singing, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands! 
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn bush, a cypress will come up, and instead of the brier, a myrtle will come up, and it will be a memorial to 
ISA.56.1	Thus says 
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the one who does this, the son of man who takes hold of it, who keeps from profaning Shabbat, and keeps his hand from doing any evil. 
ISA.56.3	Do not let a son of a foreigner who has joined himself to 
ISA.56.4	For thus says 
ISA.56.5	I will give to them in My House and within My walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off. 
ISA.56.6	Also the foreigners who join themselves to 
ISA.56.7	these I will bring to My holy mountain, and let them rejoice in My House of Prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar. For My House will be called a House of Prayer for all nations.” 
ISA.56.8	, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares, “I will gather still others to him, to those already gathered.” 
ISA.56.9	All you beasts of the field, come to eat, all you beasts in the forest. 
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are all blind. All of them know nothing. All of them are mute dogs unable to bark, dreamers lying down, lovers of slumber, 
ISA.56.11	and the dogs are greedy— they never have enough. They are shepherds with no discernment. They have all turned to their own way, each to his own gain, one and all. 
ISA.56.12	“Come, let’s get wine, let’s guzzle strong drink. Tomorrow will be like today, only even better!”
ISA.57.1	The righteous one perishes, but no one takes it to heart. Godly men are taken away, but no one discerns that the righteous man is taken from evil. 
ISA.57.2	He enters into 
ISA.57.3	But as for you, come here, you children of a sorceress, offspring of an adulterer and prostitute. 
ISA.57.4	Whom are you mocking? At whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit? 
ISA.57.5	You who burn with lust among the oaks and under every green tree, who sacrifice your children in the wadis and under the clefts of the rocks? 
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth stones of the wadi is your portion—they are your lot. To them you have even poured out a drink offering, made a grain offering. Shall I relent concerning these things? 
ISA.57.7	Upon a high and lofty mountain you made your bed. You also went up there to offer sacrifice. 
ISA.57.8	Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial sign. For away from Me, you uncovered, went up and made your bed wide, and cut covenant with them. You loved their bed— you looked on their nakedness. 
ISA.57.9	You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away, and made them go down to 
ISA.57.10	You wearied of the length of your way, yet you did not say, “It is hopeless!” You found renewed strength, so you did not weaken. 
ISA.57.11	“Whom was it you dreaded and feared, so that you lied. But you did not remember Me or take it to heart? Have I not kept silent a long time— yet you do not fear Me? 
ISA.57.12	I will expose your ‘righteousness’, and your deeds—they will not profit you. 
ISA.57.13	When you cry out, will your collection of idols save you? The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in Me will possess the land, and will inherit My holy mountain.” 
ISA.57.14	Then it will be said: “Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every stumbling block out of the way of My people.” 
ISA.57.15	For thus says the High and Exalted One who inhabits eternity, whose Name is Holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, yet also with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and revive the heart of the contrite. 
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry, for the spirit would grow weak before Me, the breath of those whom I made. 
ISA.57.17	Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry; I struck him; I hid My face; I was angry—but he went on backsliding in the way of his heart. 
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, but I will heal him. I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners. 
ISA.57.19	Creating the praise of lips: ‘
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like a troubled sea, for it cannot rest, and its waters toss up mire and dirt. 
ISA.57.21	 “There is no 
ISA.58.1	“Cry aloud, do not hold back! Raise your voice like a 
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek Me day to day and delight to know My ways, as if they were a nation that did right, and had not forsaken their God’s decree. They ask Me for righteous judgments; they delight in the nearness of God.” 
ISA.58.3	 “Why have we fasted. yet You do not see? Why have we afflicted our souls, yet You take no notice?” “Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and exploit all your laborers. 
ISA.58.4	Behold, you fast for strife and contention and to strike with a wicked fist. You should not fast as you do today to make your voice heard on high. 
ISA.58.5	Is this the fast I have chosen? A day for one to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and spreading out sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to 
ISA.58.6	“Is not this the fast I choose: to release the bonds of wickedness, to untie the cords of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to tear off every yoke? 
ISA.58.7	Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, to bring the homeless poor into your house? When you see the naked, to cover him, and not hide yourself from your own flesh and blood? 
ISA.58.8	Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will spring up speedily. Your righteousness will go before you, the glory of 
ISA.58.9	Then you will call, and 
ISA.58.10	If you give yourself to the hungry, and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness, and your gloom will be like midday. 
ISA.58.11	Then 
ISA.58.12	Some of you will rebuild the ancient ruins, will raise up the age-old foundations, will be called Repairer of the Breach, Restorer of Streets for Dwelling. 
ISA.58.13	If you turn back your foot from Shabbat, from doing your pleasure on My holy day, and call 
ISA.58.14	then You will delight yourself in 
ISA.59.1	Behold, 
ISA.59.2	Rather, your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God. Your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear. 
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness. 
ISA.59.4	No one sues justly, and none pleads a case honestly. They trust in confusion and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. 
ISA.59.5	They hatch adders’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web— whoever eats their eggs dies; crack one open, a viper breaks out. 
ISA.59.6	Their webs will not become clothing, nor will they cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are works of iniquity, an act of violence is in their hands. 
ISA.59.7	Their feet run after evil. They rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. Violence and ruin are on their highways. 
ISA.59.8	They do not know the path of peace, and there is no justice in their tracks. They have made their paths crooked. Whoever walks in them will not experience 
ISA.59.9	That is why justice is far from us and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but behold darkness, for brightness, but walk in gloom. 
ISA.59.10	We grope along the wall like the blind. We grope like those with no eyes. We stumble at noon as at twilight. We are like the dead in desolation. 
ISA.59.11	All of us growl like bears or moan like doves. We hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us. 
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us, for our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities: 
ISA.59.13	transgressing and denying 
ISA.59.14	Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot enter. 
ISA.59.15	So now truth is missing, and whoever shuns evil becomes prey. Now when 
ISA.59.16	He saw that there was no one— He was astonished that no one was interceding. Therefore His own arm brought salvation for Him, and His righteousness upheld Him. 
ISA.59.17	He put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation on His head. He clothed Himself in robes of vengeance and wrapped Himself in zeal as a cloak. 
ISA.59.18	According to their deeds, so He will repay: wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies. To the islands He will repay as due. 
ISA.59.19	So from the west they will fear the Name of 
ISA.59.20	“But a Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression.” It is a declaration of 
ISA.59.21	“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine, for your light has come! The glory of 
ISA.60.2	For behold, darkness covers the earth, and deep darkness the peoples. But 
ISA.60.3	Nations will come to your light, kings to the brilliance of your rising. 
ISA.60.4	Lift up your eyes and look all around: they all gather—they come to you— your sons will come from far away, your daughters carried on the hip. 
ISA.60.5	Then you will see and be radiant, and your heart will throb and swell with joy. For the abundance of the sea will be turned over to you. The wealth of nations will come to you. 
ISA.60.6	A multitude of camels will cover you, young camels of Midian and Ephah, all those from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and proclaim the praises of 
ISA.60.7	All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you. Nebaioth’s rams will minister to you. They will go up with favor on My altar, and I will beautify My glorious House. 
ISA.60.8	Who are these who fly like a cloud, like doves to their windows? 
ISA.60.9	Surely the islands will hope in Me, with the ships of Tarshish in the lead, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and gold with them, for the Name of 
ISA.60.10	Foreigners will build up your walls, and their kings will minister to you. For in My fury I struck you, but in My favor I will show you mercy. 
ISA.60.11	Your gates will be open continually. They will not be shut day or night, so that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, with their kings led in procession. 
ISA.60.12	For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish— those nations will be utterly ruined. 
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon will come to you —cypress, elm and pine together— to beautify the place of My Sanctuary. I will give to the place of My feet glory. 
ISA.60.14	The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you, and all those who despised you will fall at the soles of your feet. They will call you the city of 
ISA.60.15	Instead of deserted and hated, no one passing through, I will make you an eternal pride, joy from generation to generation. 
ISA.60.16	You will also suck the milk of nations and nurse at the breast of kings. Then you will know that I, 
ISA.60.17	“Instead of bronze I will bring gold, instead of iron I will bring silver, instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron. I will make 
ISA.60.18	No more will violence be heard in your land, devastation nor destruction within your borders. But you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. 
ISA.60.19	No more will the sun be your light by day, nor the glow of the moon be your light, but 
ISA.60.20	No more will your sun set, nor will your moon wane, for 
ISA.60.21	Then your people will all be righteous. They will possess the land forever— the branch of His planting, the work of My hands— that I may be glorified. 
ISA.60.22	The smallest will become a thousand, and the least a mighty nation. I, 
ISA.61.1	The 
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the year of 
ISA.61.3	to console those who mourn in Zion, to give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of 
ISA.61.4	They will rebuild the ancient ruins. They will restore former desolations. They will repair the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations. 
ISA.61.5	Strangers will stand and shepherd your flocks, children of foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers. 
ISA.61.6	But you will be called the 
ISA.61.7	Instead of your shame, double portion. instead of disgrace they will sing for joy. Therefore in their land they will inherit a double portion; they will have everlasting joy. 
ISA.61.8	For I, 
ISA.61.9	Then their offspring will be known among the nations, their descendants among the peoples. All who see them will recognize them, for they are the seed that 
ISA.61.10	I will rejoice greatly in 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes things sown to spring up, so 
ISA.62.1	For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness shines out brightly, and her salvation as a blazing torch. 
ISA.62.2	Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name, which 
ISA.62.3	You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of 
ISA.62.4	No longer will you be termed “Forsaken”, no longer your land termed “Desolate”. Instead you will be called, “My Delight is in Her” and your land, “Married”. For 
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you. As a bridegroom rejoices over a bride, so your God will rejoice over you. 
ISA.62.6	On your walls, Jerusalem, I have set watchmen. All day and all night, they will never hold their peace. “You who remind 
ISA.62.7	And give Him no rest until He establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
ISA.62.8	 has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm: “Surely I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies, nor will foreigners drink your new wine, for which you have labored. 
ISA.62.9	But those who have garnered it will eat it and praise 
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates. Clear the way for the people! Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Lift up a banner over the peoples. 
ISA.62.11	Behold, 
ISA.62.12	Then they will call them The Holy People, The Redeemed of 
ISA.63.1	“Who is this coming from Edom, in crimsoned garments from Bozrah? This One splendid in His apparel, pressing forward in His great might?” “It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.” 
ISA.63.2	“Why is Your apparel so red, and Your garments like one who treads in a wine press?” 
ISA.63.3	“I have trodden the winepress alone— from the peoples, no man was with Me. I trod them in My anger, and trampled them in My wrath. Their lifeblood spattered My garments, so I stained all My robes. 
ISA.63.4	For a day of vengeance was in My heart, and My year of redemption has come. 
ISA.63.5	I looked, but there was no one to help. I was amazed, but no one was assisting. So My own arm won victory for Me, and My wrath upheld Me. 
ISA.63.6	So I trod down the peoples in My anger, and made them drunk in My wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.” 
ISA.63.7	I will remember the lovingkindnesses of 
ISA.63.8	For He said, “Surely they are My people, children who will not deal falsely.” So He became their Savior. 
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction He was afflicted. So the angel of His presence saved them. In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them, then He lifted them and carried them all the days of old. 
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled, and grieved His 
ISA.63.11	Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses: “Where is He who brought them through the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put among them His 
ISA.63.12	Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? Who divided the waters before them— to make Himself a Name forever? 
ISA.63.13	Who led them through the depths? Like a horse in the desert, they did not stumble. 
ISA.63.14	Like cattle that go down into a valley, the 
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven and see from Your holy, glorious, lofty abode. Where are Your zeal and mighty deeds? Are the yearnings of Your heart, Your compassions, withheld from me? 
ISA.63.16	For You are our Father— even if Abraham would not know us or Israel not recognize us. You, 
ISA.63.17	, why do You cause us to stray from Your ways, and harden our heart from fearing You? Return for Your servants’ sake, the tribes of Your heritage. 
ISA.63.18	Briefly Your holy people possessed it— our foes have trampled Your Sanctuary. 
ISA.63.19	We have become like those over whom You have never ruled, like those not called by Your Name. Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at Your presence!
ISA.64.1	As fire kindles brushwood, as fire causes water to boil, make Your Name known to Your foes, so the nations may tremble before You! 
ISA.64.2	When You did awesome things that we were not expecting, You came down— the mountains shook at Your presence! 
ISA.64.3	For from days of old no one has heard, no ear perceived, no eye has seen God, except You, who acts on behalf of the one waiting for Him. 
ISA.64.4	You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness, who remembers You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry. When we keep sinning all the time, would we be saved? 
ISA.64.5	For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is like a filthy garment, and all of us wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away, like the wind. 
ISA.64.6	No one calls on Your Name, or stirs himself up to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities. 
ISA.64.7	But now, 
ISA.64.8	Do not be angry much more, 
ISA.64.9	Your holy cities became a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
ISA.64.10	Our holy and beautiful House, where our fathers praised You, Has been burned with fire— all our pleasant things are laid waste. 
ISA.64.11	Will You restrain Yourself at these things? 
ISA.65.1	“I was sought by those who did not ask for Me, I was found by those who did not seek Me. I said, ‘
ISA.65.2	I have stretched out My hands all day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own thoughts. 
ISA.65.3	These people provoke Me continually to My face, sacrificing in gardens, burning incense on bricks, 
ISA.65.4	sitting among graves, spending the night in cave-tombs; eating swine’s flesh, and the broth of detestable things is in their pots, 
ISA.65.5	who say, ‘Keep to yourself, don’t come to me, for I am holier than you!’ These are smoke in My nostrils, a fire that burns all day. 
ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before Me; I will not keep silence, but will repay, even repay into their laps, 
ISA.65.7	your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,” says 
ISA.65.8	Thus says 
ISA.65.9	I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, an heir of My mountains from Judah. My chosen ones will inherit it, and My servants will dwell there. 
ISA.65.10	Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for My people who seek Me. 
ISA.65.11	But you who forsake 
ISA.65.12	I will fate you to the sword, and all of you will kneel to slaughter. For I called, but you did not answer, I spoke, but you did not hear. So you did what was evil in My sight, and chose what I did not delight in.” 
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus says 
ISA.65.14	Behold, My servants will sing for joy with a happy heart, but you will cry from pain of heart, and wail out of a broken spirit. 
ISA.65.15	You will leave your name behind as a curse for My chosen ones, and 
ISA.65.16	So he who says a 
ISA.65.17	For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered or come to mind. 
ISA.65.18	But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating. For behold, I am creating Jerusalem for rejoicing, and her people for joy. 
ISA.65.19	Then I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and be glad in My people. No longer will the voice of weeping or the voice of crying be heard in her. 
ISA.65.20	No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days. For the youth will die at a hundred years, But one who misses the mark of a hundred must be accursed. 
ISA.65.21	They will build houses and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
ISA.65.22	They will not build and another inhabit, nor plant and another eat. For like the days of a tree, so will be the days of My people, and My chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands. 
ISA.65.23	They will not labor in vain nor bear children for calamity. For they are the offspring of those blessed by 
ISA.65.24	And it will come to pass that before they call, I will answer, and while they are still speaking, I will hear. 
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together. The lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent’s food. They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain,” says 
ISA.66.1	Thus says 
ISA.66.2	For My hand has made all these things, so all these things came to be,” declares 
ISA.66.3	One who kills an ox is like one who kills a man; one who sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; one who offers a grain offering is like one who offers swine’s blood; one who burns incense is like one who blesses an idol. They have chosen their own ways, so their soul delights in their abominations. 
ISA.66.4	So I will choose their punishments and bring on them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen. But they did what was evil in My eyes, and chose what I did not delight in. 
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of 
ISA.66.6	A sound of uproar from the city, a sound from the Temple— the sound of 
ISA.66.7	Before she was in labor, she gave birth. Before her pain came, she delivered a male child. 
ISA.66.8	Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Can a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children. 
ISA.66.9	“Will I bring the moment of birth, and not give delivery?” says 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her. Rejoice for joy with her all you who mourned over her. 
ISA.66.11	For you will nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breast. You will drink deeply and delight from her glorious abundance. 
ISA.66.12	For thus says 
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you, so you will be comforted in Jerusalem. 
ISA.66.14	You will see, your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like grass. So the hand of 
ISA.66.15	For behold, 
ISA.66.16	For by fire and His sword 
ISA.66.17	Those who consecrate and purify themselves to enter the groves, following after one in the midst, who eat swine’s flesh, vermin and mice, will come to an end altogether. It is a declaration of 
ISA.66.18	“For I know their works and their thoughts. It will come about that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see My glory. 
ISA.66.19	Then I will set up a sign among them, and I will send survivors from them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud (who pull the bow), to Tubal and Javan, to distant islands that have not heard My fame or seen My glory. Then they will declare My glory among the nations. 
ISA.66.20	“Then they will bring all your kinsmen from all the nations, as an offering to 
ISA.66.21	I will also take some of them as priests and for Levites,” says 
ISA.66.22	“For just as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will endure before Me”—it is a declaration of 
ISA.66.23	“And it will come to pass, that from one New Moon to another, and from one 
ISA.66.24	“As they leave, they will look on the corpses of the people who rebelled against Me. For their worm will not die, and their fire will not be quenched, and they will be a horror to all flesh.”
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the 
JER.1.2	The word of 
JER.1.3	It continued during the days of King Jehoiakim of Judah, son of Josiah, until the end of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah of Judah, son of Josiah—until the exile from Jerusalem in the fifth month. 
JER.1.4	The word of 
JER.1.5	“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I set you apart— I appointed you prophet to the nations.” 
JER.1.6	Then I said, “Alas, 
JER.1.7	But 
JER.1.8	Do not be afraid of them! For I am with you to deliver you.” It is a declaration of 
JER.1.9	Then 
JER.1.10	See, today I have appointed you over nations and over kingdoms: to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.” 
JER.1.11	Moreover, the word of 
JER.1.12	Then 
JER.1.13	The word of 
JER.1.14	Then 
JER.1.15	Behold! I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north.” It is a declaration of 
JER.1.16	I will pronounce My judgments on them for all their wickedness— they have forsaken Me, offering incense to other gods, worshipping the works of their hands. 
JER.1.17	Now, you, gird up your loins! Get up and tell them everything that I order you! Do not be terrified by them, or else I will terrify you before them. 
JER.1.18	Look, today I have set you up as a fortified city— an iron pillar and bronze walls— against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its princes against its 
JER.1.19	Though they will fight against you, they will not win, for I am with you, to deliver you.” It is a declaration of 
JER.2.1	Again the word of 
JER.2.2	“Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, thus says 
JER.2.3	Israel was 
JER.2.4	Hear the word of 
JER.2.5	Thus says 
JER.2.6	They did not ask ‘Where is 
JER.2.7	Yet I brought you into a fertile land, to eat of its fruit and goodness. When you came, you defiled My land. You made My heritage an abomination. 
JER.2.8	The 
JER.2.9	Therefore I will plead with you again!” It is a declaration of 
JER.2.10	Cross to the coasts of Kittim and see! Send to Kedar, and observe carefully. See if there has been anything like this. 
JER.2.11	Has a nation changed its gods— even though they are not gods? Yet My people have exchanged their glory for worthless things. 
JER.2.12	Be appalled at this, O heavens! Be utterly horrified and dumbfounded.” It is a declaration of 
JER.2.13	“My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me —the spring of living water— and they dug their own cisterns— cracked cisterns that hold no water. 
JER.2.14	Is Israel a servant—a slave by birth? Then why has he become plunder? 
JER.2.15	Young lions have roared at him they have roared loudly. They made his land a waste— his cities are in ruins and uninhabited. 
JER.2.16	Even the sons of Noph and Tahpanhes have grazed on the crown of your head. 
JER.2.17	Have you not brought this on yourself, when He led you in the way? 
JER.2.18	But now, what is on the road to Egypt? Drinking the waters of the Nile? Or what is on the road to Assyria? Drinking the waters of the Euphrates? 
JER.2.19	Your own wickedness will rebuke you and your backslidings will chide you. Know then and see how bad and bitter it is for you to forsake 
JER.2.20	“Indeed, long ago I broke your yoke and tore off your bonds. You said, ‘I will not serve!’ Instead, on every high hill and under every green tree you sprawled out as a prostitute. 
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted you as a choice vine from completely faithful seed. How then did you become to Me a wandering wild vine? 
JER.2.22	Even though you wash with lye and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your iniquity is before Me.” It is a declaration of the Lord 
JER.2.23	“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled— I have not gone after the Baalim? Look at your behavior in the Valley! Recognize what you have done. You are a swift young camel galloping aimlessly, 
JER.2.24	a wild donkey used to the wilderness— sniffing the wind in her passion— in her heat, who can restrain her? All males that pursue her will not tire themselves. At mating time they will find her. 
JER.2.25	Do not run while your feet are bare and your throat is thirsty. But you said ‘There is no hope! No! For I have loved foreign gods and I will go after them.’ 
JER.2.26	As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel is shamed— they, their kings, their princes, their 
JER.2.27	They say to wood, ‘You are my father’ and to a stone, ‘You birthed me.’ They have turned their back to Me and not their face. Yet when they are in trouble they say, ‘Rise up and save us!’ 
JER.2.28	Where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them come—if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you have as many gods as y0u have cities, O Judah. 
JER.2.29	Why do you strive with Me? You have all rebelled against Me.” It is a declaration of 
JER.2.30	“In vain I struck your children. They took no correction. Your sword devoured your prophets like a ravaging lion.” 
JER.2.31	You, generation, heed 
JER.2.32	Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me, days without number. 
JER.2.33	How clever are your ways of seeking love. Therefore you even taught wicked women your ways. 
JER.2.34	Moreover on your skirts is found the blood of the innocent poor —you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things, 
JER.2.35	you say, ‘I am innocent— surely His anger is turned away from me?’ See, I will pass judgment on you, since you say: ‘I haven’t sinned!’ 
JER.2.36	Why do you make light of changing your way? You will be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria. 
JER.2.37	You will also go out from there with your hands on your head. For 
JER.3.1	“If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him to be with another man, will he return to her again? Would not such a land be totally polluted? You are a prostitute with many lovers. Now are you returning to Me?” It is a declaration of 
JER.3.2	“Lift your eyes to the barren hills and see! Where have you not been violated? By the wayside you sat waiting for them like a nomad in the desert. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and wickedness. 
JER.3.3	Therefore showers have been withheld and there has been no spring rain. You have a harlot’s brazen look; you refuse to be ashamed. 
JER.3.4	Did you not just now call to Me: ‘Avi! You are a friend of my youth. 
JER.3.5	Would He keep a grudge forever? Would He keep it to the end?’ So you said—yet you have done all the evil things you could.” 
JER.3.6	Then 
JER.3.7	Yet I thought that after she had done all this she would return to Me. But she did not return. Even her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. 
JER.3.8	I noted that when backsliding Israel committed adultery I sent her away and gave her a certificate of divorce. Yet, unfaithful Judah, her sister, did not fear. Instead she also went and committed adultery. 
JER.3.9	It happened that through her frivolous prostitution, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and with wood. 
JER.3.10	Yet after all this her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to Me with her whole heart, but only insincerely,” It is a declaration of 
JER.3.11	Then 
JER.3.12	Go! Proclaim these words toward the north, saying: “Return backsliding Israel,” says 
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your iniquity. For you sinned against 
JER.3.14	“Return, O backsliding children,” declares 
JER.3.15	I will give you shepherds after My own heart who will feed you knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	It will be in those days when you multiply and become fruitful in the land.” It is a declaration of 
JER.3.17	At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel. They will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.” 
JER.3.19	“Then I Myself said: ‘How gladly would I make you sons and give you a pleasant land— the most beautiful inheritance of the nations!’ I thought you would call Me—Avi!— and would not turn from following Me. 
JER.3.20	Yet as a woman betrays her lover, so have you betrayed Me, O house of Israel.” It is a declaration of 
JER.3.21	A voice is heard on the barren hills —the weeping and supplication of the children of Israel— because they perverted their way and forgot 
JER.3.22	“Return, backsliding children! I will heal your backsliding.” “Yes, we will come to You for You are 
JER.3.23	Surely help from the hills is a delusion— the commotion of the mountains! Surely in 
JER.3.24	But the shame has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth— their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	Let’s lie down with our shame and let our disgrace cover us! For we have sinned against 
JER.4.1	“If you will return, O Israel, return to Me,” declares 
JER.4.2	You will swear, ‘As 
JER.4.3	Thus says 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to 
JER.4.5	Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, saying: “Blow the 
JER.4.6	“Raise a banner toward Zion! Take refuge! Do not delay! For I bring calamity from the north, even terrible destruction. 
JER.4.7	A lion has come up from his thicket— a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to make your land a wasteland. Your cities will lie in ruins, without inhabitant. 
JER.4.8	Therefore, put on sackcloth— lament and wail! For the fierce anger of 
JER.4.9	“It will happen in that day” —it is a declaration of 
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Alas, 
JER.4.11	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching wind from the barren hills in the wilderness blows toward My people, but not to winnow or to sift—
JER.4.12	a wind too strong for these things will come from Me. Now even I will pronounce judgments against them.” 
JER.4.13	See, he comes up like clouds, and his chariots like whirlwinds. His horses are swifter than eagles— “
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, purify your heart from wickedness, so that you may be saved. How long will your wicked thoughts lodge within you? 
JER.4.15	A voice announces from Dan and proclaims calamity from the hills of Ephraim, 
JER.4.16	“Remind the nations, proclaim over Jerusalem! Besiegers are soon coming from a far country, raising their voice against the cities of Judah. 
JER.4.17	Like keepers of a field they surround her, because she has been rebellious against Me.” It is a declaration of 
JER.4.18	Your conduct and your deeds have brought these things on you. This is your calamity! How bitter it is! How it smites your heart! 
JER.4.19	My stomach, my stomach! I writhe in anguish! The pain of my heart! My heart is pounding within me! I cannot keep silent because I have heard, O my soul, the sound of the 
JER.4.20	Disaster on disaster is reported. So the whole land is ruined. My tents are suddenly ravaged, my curtains in an instant. 
JER.4.21	How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the 
JER.4.22	“For My people are foolish. They do not know Me. They are senseless children, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they do not know.” 
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth and behold, it was deserted and desolate, and at the heavens and they had no light. 
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains— behold, they were shaking and all the hills swaying to and fro. 
JER.4.25	I looked and behold, no people! All the birds of the sky had fled. 
JER.4.26	I looked and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness and all of its cities were in ruins before 
JER.4.27	For thus says 
JER.4.28	Therefore, the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow black. For I have spoken, I have purposed, nor will I relent, nor turn from it. 
JER.4.29	At the sound of horsemen and archers the whole city flees. They go into the thickets and climb up on the rocks. The whole city is deserted— no one dwells in it. 
JER.4.30	And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Though you dress in scarlet, though you adorn yourself with gold ornaments though you enlarge your eyes with paint—in vain you make yourself beautiful— your lovers despise you, they seek your life. 
JER.4.31	For I heard a cry like one in labor, the anguish of one giving birth to her first child— the cry of the Daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands saying, “
JER.5.1	Roam the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares! If you can find a person, if there is one who does justice, who seeks truth, then I will pardon the city. 
JER.5.2	Though they say, “As 
JER.5.3	, do Your eyes not look for faithfulness? You struck them, but they did not grieve. You disciplined them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone. They refused to return. 
JER.5.4	Then I said: These are only the poor. They are foolish. For they do not know the way of 
JER.5.5	I will go to the distinguished and speak to them. Surely they know the way of 
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them. A desert wolf will ravage them. A leopard watches over their cities. Everyone who ventures out will be torn to pieces, For their rebellion is great, their backslidings frequent. 
JER.5.7	“Why therefore should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by those who are not gods. Even though I fed them well, they committed adultery and thronged to the prostitute houses. 
JER.5.8	They are well-fed, lustful stallions, each neighing for his neighbor’s wife. 
JER.5.9	For such, should I not punish them?” It is a declaration of 
JER.5.10	Go up into her vines and ravage them, but do not completely destroy them. Strip away her branches for they are not 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to Me.” It is a declaration of 
JER.5.12	They have lied about 
JER.5.13	The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them. Let what they say be done to them!” 
JER.5.14	Therefore thus says 
JER.5.15	See, I am bringing a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel.” It is a declaration of 
JER.5.16	Their quiver is an open grave. They are all mighty warriors. 
JER.5.17	They will devour your harvest and your food. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They will devour your flocks and your herds. They will devour your vines and your fig trees. They will demolish your fortified cities —the ones in which you trust— with the sword. 
JER.5.18	“Yet even in those days,” declares 
JER.5.19	So it will come to pass that when you ask, ‘Why has 
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah, saying: 
JER.5.21	‘Hear this you foolish people who have no understanding, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear. 
JER.5.22	Do you not fear Me?’ says 
JER.5.23	But this people have a stubborn and rebellious heart. They have turned aside and gone away. 
JER.5.24	They do not say in their heart, ‘Let us now fear 
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned these away, your sins have deprived you of bounty. 
JER.5.26	For among My people are wicked men, watching like bait-layers lying in wait. They set a trap—they catch men. 
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. That is why they grew great and rich. 
JER.5.28	They grew fat and sleek. They also overlooked evil deeds. They do not uphold a cause— the cause of an orphan to prosper— nor do they defend the right of the poor. 
JER.5.29	Should I not punish them?” says 
JER.5.30	An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land. 
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely, the 
JER.6.1	Flee for refuge, children of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the 
JER.6.2	“The lovely, delicate Daughter of Zion I will cut off.” 
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks are coming against her. All around her they pitch their tents, each pasturing in his own place. 
JER.6.4	“Prepare for war against her. Rise up! Let’s attack at noon.” “
JER.6.5	“Rise up! Let’s attack at night and destroy her palaces.” 
JER.6.6	For thus says 
JER.6.7	As a well gushes out its waters, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and havoc are heard in her, sickness and wounds ever before Me. 
JER.6.8	Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I abandon you, lest I make you desolate— an uninhabited land.” 
JER.6.9	Thus says 
JER.6.10	“To whom can I speak and warn so they would hear? See, their ears are uncircumcised, unable to hear! The word of 
JER.6.11	So I am full of the wrath of 
JER.6.12	Their homes will be turned over to others—together with their fields and their wives. For I will stretch out My hand on the inhabitants of the land.” It is a declaration of 
JER.6.13	“For from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy for gain, and from prophet even to 
JER.6.14	They healed the wound of My people superficially, saying ‘
JER.6.15	""Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at al ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among thos who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown,"" says 
JER.6.16	Thus says 
JER.6.17	So I set watchmen over you, saying ‘Listen to the sound of the 
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, O nations and observe, O congregation, what is against them. 
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth! See, I will bring disaster on this people —fruit of their schemes— for they did not listen to My words and rejected My 
JER.6.20	Of what use to Me is frankincense coming from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to Me.” 
JER.6.21	Therefore thus says 
JER.6.22	Thus says 
JER.6.23	They are armed with bow and spear, cruel and with no compassion. They sound like the roaring sea— as they ride on horses as men in battle formation, against you, Daughter of Zion!” 
JER.6.24	“We have heard of their fame. Our hands hang limp; anguish has gripped us, pain like a woman in labor. 
JER.6.25	Don’t go out into the field or walk on the road. Since the enemy has a sword, there’s terror on every side!” 
JER.6.26	“Daughter of My people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn as for an only son with bitter lamentation.” “For suddenly the destroyer will come on us!” 
JER.6.27	“I have made you a metal-tester among My people—so you may observe and test their way. 
JER.6.28	They are all stubborn rebels spreading slander. They are bronze and iron, all of them are corrupt. 
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely, blasting away the lead with fire. The refining is completely in vain, for the wicked are not drawn off. 
JER.6.30	They are called ‘cast off silver’— for 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from 
JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of 
JER.7.3	Thus says 
JER.7.4	Do not trust in deceptive words and say ‘The Temple of 
JER.7.5	“No, if you truly mend your ways and your deeds—if you are doing justice between a man and his neighbor, 
JER.7.6	not oppressing the sojourner, orphan and widow nor shedding innocent blood in this place, nor going after other gods to your own ruin—
JER.7.7	then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever. 
JER.7.8	Look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are empty. 
JER.7.9	Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery and perjury, and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known—
JER.7.10	and then come and stand before Me in this house that bears My Name, saying, ‘We are saved!’—so that you may keep doing all these abominations? 
JER.7.11	Has this House, which bears My Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Look, even I have seen it!” It is a declaration of 
JER.7.12	“Indeed, go now to My place that was in Shiloh, where I first made My Name dwell. Now see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. 
JER.7.13	While you were doing all these things,” declares 
JER.7.14	Therefore I will do to the House that bears My Name—the one in which you trust, the one that I gave to you and to your fathers—as I have done to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of My sight, just as I cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim. 
JER.7.16	“As for you, do not pray for this people. Do not offer any supplication or petition for them, nor entreat Me, because I will not hear you. 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire and the women knead the dough to make sacrificial cakes to the queen of heaven. Moreover, they pour out drink offerings to other gods in order to provoke Me to anger. 
JER.7.19	But am I the One they are provoking?” declares 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus says 
JER.7.21	Thus says 
JER.7.22	For on the day that I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt I did not speak to them nor did I command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices, 
JER.7.23	but I explicitly commanded them: ‘Obey My voice and I will be your God to you and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you that it may go well with you.’ 
JER.7.24	But they did not listen or pay attention. Instead they followed their own counsel, in the stubbornness of their evil heart. They have gone backward and not forward, 
JER.7.25	from the day your fathers left the land of Egypt until today. Although I sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily and persistently, 
JER.7.26	they did not listen to Me or pay attention. Rather, they stiffened their neck, doing more evil than their fathers. 
JER.7.27	“When you tell them all these things, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	So you will say to them, ‘This nation has not obeyed the voice of 
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair and throw it away and take up a lamentation on the barren hills. For 
JER.7.30	“The children of Judah have done what is evil in My sight”—it is a declaration of 
JER.7.31	They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire—which I did not command, nor did it even enter My mind. 
JER.7.32	Therefore, the days are soon coming,” declares 
JER.7.33	The carcasses of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth, and no one will frighten them away. 
JER.7.34	Then I will bring an end, from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, to the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. For the land will be desolate.”
JER.8.1	“At that time”—it is a declaration of 
JER.8.2	They will spread them out to the sun, the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, and after which they have walked and sought, and which they have worshipped. They will not be gathered or buried, but will be like dung on the face of the ground. 
JER.8.3	So death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family that remains in all the places to which I have driven them.” It is a declaration of 
JER.8.4	Moreover you will say to them, thus says 
JER.8.5	Why then has this people—Jerusalem— turned away in perpetual backsliding? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return. 
JER.8.6	I listened attentively, but they have not spoken what is right. No one repents of his wickedness, saying, ‘What have I done?’ Each one turns in his own direction, like a horse charging into battle. 
JER.8.7	Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed times, and the turtledove, swallow and crane observe the time of their migration, but My people do not know the judgments of 
JER.8.8	How can you say, ‘We are wise! The 
JER.8.9	The wise men will be put to shame— shattered, trapped. Look! They have rejected 
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to others and their fields to new owners. For from the least to the greatest everyone is greedy for gain. From the prophet even to the 
JER.8.11	They heal the fracture of the daughter of My people by treating it superficially— saying, ‘
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed of the abomination they committed? No, not ashamed, not at all— they do not know how to blush! So they will fall among the fallen. At the time of their punishment they will be brought down.” It is a declaration of 
JER.8.13	“I will utterly consume them,” says 
JER.8.14	“Why are we sitting here? Assemble! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For 
JER.8.15	We hoped for 
JER.8.16	From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses. At the sound of his stallions neighing, the whole land quakes. For they come and devour the land and everything in it— the city and all who live there. 
JER.8.17	“For I am about to send serpents on you, vipers for which there is no charm, and they will bite you.” It is a declaration of 
JER.8.18	My joy is overcome by grief, my heart is faint within me. 
JER.8.19	Listen, the sound of the cry of the daughter of my people —a voice from a distant land— “Is 
JER.8.20	“Harvest is past, summer is over, yet we are not saved.” 
JER.8.21	“Because of the brokenness of the daughter of my people, I am brokenhearted. I mourn—desolation grips me. 
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Then why has no healing gone up for the daughter of my people? 
JER.8.23	If only my head were water and my eyes a fountain of tears, then I would weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 
JER.9.1	If only I had a travelers’ lodging place in the wilderness, then I might leave my people and get away from them! For they are all adulterers, a bunch of traitors. 
JER.9.2	They bend their tongue like a bow. Lies, not faithfulness, prevail in the land. “For they go from evil to evil and do not know Me,” says 
JER.9.3	Beware, everyone, of your neighbor! Don’t even trust a brother. For every brother grabs like Jacob and every neighbor spreads slander. 
JER.9.4	Everyone deceives his neighbor and does not speak the truth. They taught their tongue to speak lies. They wear themselves out doing wrong. 
JER.9.5	“You dwell in the midst of deceit. In deceit they refuse to know Me.” It is a declaration of 
JER.9.6	Therefore thus says 
JER.9.7	Their tongue is a deadly arrow, speaking deceit. With his mouth each says 
JER.9.8	For such things shall I not punish them?” It is a declaration of 
JER.9.9	For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, a lament for the desert pastures. For they are so scorched that no one passes through— the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds of the air have fled and the animals are gone. 
JER.9.10	“I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair for jackals. I will make the cities of Judah a wasteland without inhabitant. 
JER.9.11	Who is the one wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of 
JER.9.12	 said “It is because they have forsaken My 
JER.9.13	but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baalim that their fathers taught them. 
JER.9.14	Therefore, thus says 
JER.9.15	I will scatter them among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will pursue them with the sword, until I have finished with them.” 
JER.9.16	Thus says 
JER.9.17	“Let them come quickly and lift up a wailing over us so our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush with water.” 
JER.9.18	For a wailing voice is heard from Zion: “How we are ruined! We are utterly ashamed— we have forsaken the land, for they tore down our dwellings.” 
JER.9.19	Now, hear the word of 
JER.9.20	For death has climbed through our windows. It has entered into our palaces to cut off children from the street and young men from the squares.” 
JER.9.21	“Say this,” declares 
JER.9.22	Thus says 
JER.9.23	But let one who boasts boast in this: that he understands and knows Me. For I am 
JER.9.24	“Days are soon coming,” declares 
JER.9.25	Egypt, Judah, Edom and Ammon’s children and Moab, and all that have cut the corners of their hair—that dwell in the wilderness. For all the nations are uncircumcised but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
JER.10.1	Hear the word that 
JER.10.2	Thus says 
JER.10.3	The customs of the peoples are useless: it is just a tree cut from the forest, the work of the hands of a craftsman with a chisel. 
JER.10.4	They decorate it with silver and gold, and fasten it with hammer and nails so it won’t totter. 
JER.10.5	Like a scarecrow in a cucumber garden, their idols cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk! Do not fear them for they can do no harm —nor do any good.” 
JER.10.6	There is none like You, 
JER.10.7	 Who should not fear You, Ruler of the nations? For it is your due! For among all the wise of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. 
JER.10.8	They are totally stupid and foolish. Discipline is useless—it’s wood! 
JER.10.9	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. The work of the craftsman and of the goldsmith’s hands is clothed in blue and purple— all the work of skillful men. 
JER.10.10	But 
JER.10.11	Thus you will say to them: “The gods—which did not make the heavens and the earth—will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.” 
JER.10.12	He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out heaven by His understanding. 
JER.10.13	When His voice thunders, waters in heaven roar. He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings forth wind from His storehouses. 
JER.10.14	Everyone is stupid, ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idol! His molten image is a fraud. There is no breath in them. 
JER.10.15	They are futile, a work of mockery. In the time of their punishment they will perish. 
JER.10.16	Jacob’s portion is not like these. For He is the Maker of all things and Israel, the tribe of His inheritance —
JER.10.17	Pick up your bundle from the ground, you who live under siege. 
JER.10.18	For thus says 
JER.10.19	 to me because of my brokenness! My wound is incurable. Yet I said, “This is simply a sickness and I must bear it.” 
JER.10.20	“My tent is destroyed and all my ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more. No one is left to stretch out my tent or set up my tent curtains. 
JER.10.21	For the shepherds are stupid! They have not sought 
JER.10.22	Listen! The sound of a report is coming— a great commotion out of the land of the north— to make the cities of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. 
JER.10.23	I know, 
JER.10.24	Chasten me, 
JER.10.25	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You and on the families that do not call on Your Name. For they have devoured Jacob, devoured and consumed him, and destroyed his homeland. 
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from 
JER.11.2	Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
JER.11.3	Now say to them, Thus says 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your forefathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt—out of the iron furnace—saying: ‘Listen to My voice, and do all that I command you. Then you will be My people, and I will be your God. 
JER.11.5	Then I will fulfill the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is today.’” In response I said, “Amen, 
JER.11.6	Then 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly forewarned your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt until this day, forewarning early and often, saying ‘Listen to My voice!’ 
JER.11.8	Yet they would not obey or incline their ear, but each one walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant—which I commanded them to do, but they did not.” 
JER.11.9	Then 
JER.11.10	They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. “The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.” 
JER.11.11	Therefore thus says 
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense—but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.13	For as numerous as your cities are your gods, O Judah, and as numerous as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing—altars to burn incense to Baal. 
JER.11.14	As for you, you are not to pray for this people or lift up supplication or prayer for them, for I will not hear them at the time they cry out to Me because of their disaster.”
JER.11.15	“What is My beloved doing in My House as she does evil schemes with many? Can holy meat prevent your disaster? So you may rejoice? 
JER.11.16	 called your name— a leafy olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit. With the noise of a great tumult He has set it on fire, and its branches are broken. 
JER.11.17	For 
JER.11.18	Moreover, 
JER.11.19	But I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter. I did not know they had devised plots against me: “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit. Let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will be no more remembered.” 
JER.11.20	But 
JER.11.21	Therefore thus says 
JER.11.22	Therefore thus says 
JER.11.23	No remnant will be left to them, for I will bring calamity on the men of Anathoth—the year of their visitation.
JER.12.1	Righteous are You, 
JER.12.2	You planted them, so they have taken root. They are growing, bearing fruit. You are near in their mouth, yet far from their mind. 
JER.12.3	But You have known me, 
JER.12.4	How long will the land mourn and the grass of all the field wither? Because those living in it are evil, beasts and birds are swept away. For they said, “He cannot see our end.” 
JER.12.5	“If you raced with those on foot and they wore you out, how can you compete with horses? If you are secure in a land of peace, how will you do in Jordan’s thickets? 
JER.12.6	For even your brothers —your father’s house— even they will betray you, even they will shout out after you. Have no confidence in them, even if they say nice words to you.” 
JER.12.7	“I have abandoned My House. I have forsaken My inheritance. I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies. 
JER.12.8	My inheritance became to Me like a lion in the forest— her voice roared against Me! Therefore I despised her. 
JER.12.9	Is My inheritance a speckled vulture? Are vultures circling all around her? Go, gather all the wild beasts, bring them for devouring!
JER.12.10	“Many shepherds ruined My vineyard. They trampled My property. They made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 
JER.12.11	They made it a wasteland. It mourns before Me, desolate. The whole land will be laid waste, because no one takes it to heart.” 
JER.12.12	On all the bare hills in the wilderness destroyers have come. For the sword of 
JER.12.13	They sowed wheat but reaped thorns. They wore themselves out, gaining nothing. So be ashamed of your harvest, because of 
JER.12.14	Thus says 
JER.12.15	Yet it will come to pass, after I have uprooted them, that I will again have compassion on them and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land. 
JER.12.16	“So it will come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people—to swear by My Name, ‘As 
JER.12.17	But if they will not obey, then I will uproot that nation, plucking it up and destroying it.” It is a declaration of 
JER.13.1	Thus 
JER.13.2	So I got a waistband in keeping with the word of 
JER.13.3	Then the word of 
JER.13.4	“Take the waistband that you bought, which is on your waist, and get up, go to Perath and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” 
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it at Perath, as 
JER.13.6	Now it came to pass after many days that 
JER.13.7	So I went to Perath, dug it up and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. But to my surprise, the waistband was marred, worth nothing at all. 
JER.13.8	Then the word of 
JER.13.9	thus says 
JER.13.10	This wicked people, who refuse to hear My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their own heart, and go after other gods to serve them and worship them, will be just like this waistband—worth nothing at all. 
JER.13.11	For just as the waistband clings to a man’s waist, so I will make the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to Me,” declares 
JER.13.12	Moreover, speak this word to them, thus says 
JER.13.13	Then you will say to them, thus says 
JER.13.14	And I will smash them against each other, even fathers and sons,’ says 
JER.13.15	Hear and give ear! Do not be haughty! For 
JER.13.16	Give glory to 
JER.13.17	But if you will not listen, my soul will sob in secret before such pride, and my eyes will weep bitterly and overflow with tears, for 
JER.13.18	Say to the king and the queen mother: “Sit down low, for your glorious crown has fallen from your head.” 
JER.13.19	The towns of the South will be shut up, with no one to open them. All Judah is taken into exile— utterly swept into exile. 
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock given to you, Your beautiful sheep? 
JER.13.21	What will you say, when He sets up the allies you cultivated for yourself, over you as head? Will not labor pains seize you, like a woman in travail? 
JER.13.22	Suppose you say in your heart, “Why did these things happen to me?” Because of your great iniquity, your skirts are uncovered and your heels suffer violence. 
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin? Or the leopard his spots? So, could you do good, that are accustomed to doing evil? 
JER.13.24	“Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw in the desert wind. 
JER.13.25	This is your lot, the portion measured for you from Me.” It is a declaration of 
JER.13.26	Therefore I will also uncover your skirts over your face, expose your shame. 
JER.13.27	Your adulteries, your lustful neighings, the lewdness of your prostitution— on the hills in the field I have seen your loathsome acts. 
JER.14.1	The word of 
JER.14.2	Judah will mourn, and her gates languish. They will bow in black to the ground And Jerusalem’s wail will go up. 
JER.14.3	Their nobles will send their lads for water. They come to the cisterns, but find no water. Their jars return empty. They are ashamed and humiliated; they cover their heads. 
JER.14.4	Because the ground is cracked, since there has been no rain in the land, the farmers are ashamed— they cover their heads. 
JER.14.5	For even the doe in the field abandons her newborn fawn, because there is no grass. 
JER.14.6	Wild donkeys stand on the barren hills, as they pant for air like jackals. Their eyes fail, since there is no foliage. 
JER.14.7	Though our iniquities testify against us, 
JER.14.8	O hope of Israel, Savior in time of trouble, why are You like a stranger in the land, or like a traveler who stays for a night? 
JER.14.9	Why are You like a man overcome, like a champion who cannot save? Yet you, 
JER.14.10	Thus says 
JER.14.11	So 
JER.14.12	If they fast, I will not hear their cry. If they offer burnt offering or grain offering, I will not accept them. Instead I will consume them with sword, with famine and with plague.” 
JER.14.13	Then I said: “Oh my Lord, 
JER.14.14	Then 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus says 
JER.14.16	Also the people to whom they prophesy will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword. They will have no one to bury them, their wives, their sons or their daughters. For I will pour their disaster on them.” 
JER.14.17	You will say this word to them: “Let my eyes overflow with tears. Night and day, may they never stop. For the virgin daughter of my people is crushed with a great blow, with a sorely infected wound.”
JER.14.18	If I go out into the field, see, those slain by the sword! And if I enter into the city, see, the sick with famine! For both prophet and 
JER.14.19	Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion? Why have You smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for 
JER.14.20	We acknowledge our wickedness, 
JER.14.21	Do not despise us, for Your Name’s sake. Do not dishonor Your glorious throne. Remember Your covenant with us— do not break it! 
JER.14.22	Can any of the idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies grant showers? Is it not You, 
JER.15.1	Then said 
JER.15.2	It will come to pass, when they say to you, ‘Where should we go?’ Then You will tell them, thus says 
JER.15.3	I have appointed over them four kinds” —it is a declaration of 
JER.15.4	“So I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem. 
JER.15.5	“Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Or who will grieve for you? Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare? 
JER.15.6	You have cast Me off” —it is a declaration of 
JER.15.7	I will scatter them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I will bereave them of children and destroy My people, since they do not repent of their ways. 
JER.15.8	Their widows will increase before Me more than the sand of the seas, I will bring a destroyer at noonday against the mother of a young man. Suddenly I will bring down on her anguish and terrors. 
JER.15.9	She who bore seven languishes. She breathes out her soul. Her sun sets while it is yet day. She is shamed and humiliated. Their survivors I give to the sword before their enemies.” It is a declaration of 
JER.15.10	 to me, my mother, that you gave birth to me— a man of strife and conflict to all the land! I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me. 
JER.15.11	 said: “Surely I will release you for good. Surely I will make the enemy appeal to you in a time of trouble, in a time of affliction. 
JER.15.12	Can anyone smash iron— iron and bronze from the north? 
JER.15.13	Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without cost, for all your sins, in all your borders. 
JER.15.14	I will take you away with your enemies into a land you do not know, for a fire is kindled in My nostril, which will burn against you.” 
JER.15.15	, you know. Remember me and think of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. Because of Your long-suffering, do not take me away. Know that for Your sake I endure scorn. 
JER.15.16	Your words were found, so I ate them. Your words were a delight to me and the joy of my heart. For I am called by Your Name, 
JER.15.17	I never sat in the company of revelers nor made merry. Because of Your hand I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation. 
JER.15.18	Why is my pain unending and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will You be to me like a mirage of water that is undependable? 
JER.15.19	Therefore thus says 
JER.15.20	I will make you a fortified bronze wall to this people. They will fight against you, but will not prevail against you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you.” It is a declaration of 
JER.15.21	“So I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the grasp of the ruthless.”
JER.16.1	The word of 
JER.16.2	“You will not take a wife for yourself or have sons or daughters in this place.” 
JER.16.3	For thus says 
JER.16.4	They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be lamented or buried, but will be like dung on the surface of the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and famine, and their carcasses will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. 
JER.16.5	For thus says 
JER.16.6	Both great and small will die in this land; they will not be buried; neither will anyone lament for them, or cut themselves or shave his head for them. 
JER.16.7	No one will break bread for them in mourning, to give comfort for the dead. Nor will anyone offer a cup of consolation to drink for anyone’s father or for his mother. 
JER.16.8	“You must not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink” 
JER.16.9	For thus says 
JER.16.10	“Now it will come to pass, when You will tell this people all these words, they will say to you: ‘Why has 
JER.16.11	Then will You say to them: ‘Because your fathers have forsaken Me,’ says 
JER.16.12	Yes, you have done worse than your fathers. For here you are, each of you walking after the stubbornness of his evil heart, not listening to Me. 
JER.16.13	So I will cast you out of this land into a land that you have not known—neither you nor your fathers—and there you will serve other gods day and night. For I will give you no grace.’
JER.16.14	“Therefore, the days are quickly coming,” declares 
JER.16.15	Rather, ‘As 
JER.16.16	“Behold, I will send for many fishers,” says 
JER.16.17	For My eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes. 
JER.16.18	First I will repay them double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have profaned My land, and they have filled My possession with the carcasses of their vile things and their abominations.” 
JER.16.19	, my strength, my stronghold, my refuge in the day of affliction, to You will the nations come from the ends of the earth and say: “Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, futility and useless things.” 
JER.16.20	Will man make gods for himself? Yet they are not gods. 
JER.16.21	“So I will surely make them know— this time I make them know My hand and My might— they will know that My Name is 
JER.17.1	Judah’s sin is written with an iron pen and with a point of a diamond, engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of your altars. 
JER.17.2	So their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles by leafy trees on the high hills. 
JER.17.3	My mountain in the country, your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, along with your high places for sin within all your borders. 
JER.17.4	So you, on your own, let go of your heritage that I gave you. So I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know. For you have kindled a fire in My nose that will burn forever.”
JER.17.5	Thus says 
JER.17.6	For he will be like a bush in the desert. He cannot see goodness when it comes, but will dwell in parched places in the wilderness— a salt land where no one lives. 
JER.17.7	Blessed is the one who trusts in 
JER.17.8	For he will be like a tree planted by the waters, spreading out its roots by a stream. It has no fear when heat comes, but its leaves will be green. It does not worry in a year of drought, nor depart from yielding fruit.
JER.17.9	“The heart is deceitful above all things, and incurable—who can know it? 
JER.17.10	I 
JER.17.11	As a partridge that broods over young that she did not lay, so is one who gets wealth, unjustly. In the middle of his days it will abandon him, so at his end he will be a fool. 
JER.17.12	Throne of glory on high from the beginning! Place of our sanctuary, 
JER.17.13	, You are the hope of Israel! All who forsake You will be ashamed. Those who depart from You will be written in the dirt, for they have forsaken 
JER.17.14	Heal me, 
JER.17.15	Look, they are saying to me, “Where is the word of 
JER.17.16	As for me, I have not run away from being a shepherd after You, nor have I desired the woeful day. What came out of my lips You know—it was before You. 
JER.17.17	Be not a ruin to me— You are my refuge in the evil day. 
JER.17.18	Let my persecutors be ashamed, yet let me not be ashamed. Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them the evil day, Destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	Thus said 
JER.17.20	and say to them: ‘Hear the word of 
JER.17.21	Thus says 
JER.17.22	Nor should you carry a burden out of your houses on 
JER.17.23	Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, not hearing or accepting correction. 
JER.17.24	“However, if you listen attentively to Me,” says 
JER.17.25	then there will enter in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—with their princes, the people of Judah and those dwelling in Jerusalem—and this city will be inhabited forever. 
JER.17.26	They will come from the cities of Judah and from all around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country and from the South, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings, frankincense, and sacrifices of thanksgiving to the House of 
JER.17.27	“But if you do not listen to Me to keep 
JER.18.1	The word came to Jeremiah from 
JER.18.2	“Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear My words.” 
JER.18.3	So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was making a work on the wheels. 
JER.18.4	Whenever the pot that he was making from the clay became flawed in the hand of the potter, he remade it into another pot, as it pleased the potter to make. 
JER.18.5	Then the word of 
JER.18.6	“O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?” declares 
JER.18.7	At one moment I may speak about a nation or about a kingdom, to uproot, to pull down or to destroy it. 
JER.18.8	But if that nation turns from their evil, because of what I have spoken against it, I will relent concerning the calamity that I planned to do to it. 
JER.18.9	Or at another time I may speak about a nation or about a kingdom, to build up or to plant it. 
JER.18.10	But if it does evil in My sight, not listening to My voice, then I will relent of the good that I had said I would do to it.” 
JER.18.11	So now, speak to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, thus says 
JER.18.12	But they say: ‘It’s hopeless! So we will walk after our own plans, and each of us will act in the stubbornness of his evil heart.’” 
JER.18.13	Therefore thus says 
JER.18.14	Does the snow of Lebanon abandon the rock of the field? Or is the cold water flowing from afar pulled back? 
JER.18.15	Yet My people have forgotten Me. They burn incense to a delusion and stumble in their ways— off the ancient paths— to walk on side-tracks, rather than a built-up highway. 
JER.18.16	Their land will become a horror, a perpetual hissing— every one passing by will be stunned and shake his head. 
JER.18.17	Like an east wind, I will scatter them before the enemy. I will see their back, not their face, in the day of their calamity.”
JER.18.18	Then they said: “Come, let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Surely 
JER.18.19	Be attentive to me, 
JER.18.20	Will good be repaid for evil? For they dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your wrath from them. 
JER.18.21	Therefore give their children to famine and pour out the power of the sword. Let their wives be bereaved of children, and widows, and let their men be slain to death, and their young men struck down by the sword in battle. 
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses when suddenly You bring a troop on them. For they dug a pit to capture me, and hid snares for my feet. 
JER.18.23	Yet You know their whole plot, 
JER.19.1	Thus said 
JER.19.2	and go out to the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Proclaim there the words that I will tell you, 
JER.19.3	and say, “Hear the word of 
JER.19.4	For they have forsaken Me and have alienated this place, by burning sacrifices in it to other gods, which neither they nor their forefathers, nor the kings of Judah have known. They have also filled this place with the blood of innocents. 
JER.19.5	They have built high places for Baal, in order to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal—something I never commanded, nor mentioned, nor did it ever come into My mind.’” 
JER.19.6	“Therefore behold, the days are coming”—it is a declaration of 
JER.19.7	So I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will have them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of them that seek their life. I will give their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. 
JER.19.8	And I will make this city a horror and a hissing—every one passing by will be stunned and hiss because of all her wounds. 
JER.19.9	And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone will eat his companion’s flesh during the siege and distress, which their enemies and those who seek their life will inflict on them. 
JER.19.10	“Then you will shatter the jar in the presence of the people who accompany you, 
JER.19.11	and say to them, thus says 
JER.19.12	“Thus I will do to this place”—it is a declaration of 
JER.19.13	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be as defiled as the place Topheth—all the houses on whose roofs they burned incense to the whole heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.” 
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where 
JER.19.15	thus says 
JER.20.1	When Pashhur son of Immer the 
JER.20.2	Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Benjamin Gate by the House of 
JER.20.3	The following morning, Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “
JER.20.4	For thus says 
JER.20.5	“Moreover I will give away all the wealth of this city, and all its produce and its precious things, even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, who will plunder them, take them away, and bring them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	“As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity, and you will go to Babylon. So there you will die, and there you will be buried—you and all your friends—to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
JER.20.7	, You enticed me, so I was enticed. You overpowered me, and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all day long. Everyone mocks me. 
JER.20.8	For whenever I speak, I cry out, I proclaim, “Violence and ruin!” For the word of 
JER.20.9	But if I say: “I won’t mention Him, or speak any more in His Name,” then it is like fire burning in my heart— shut up in my bones— I weary myself holding it in, but I cannot. 
JER.20.10	For I heard the whispering of many: “‘Terror on every side?’ Denounce him! Let’s denounce him!” Even all my close friends are watching for my fall: “Perhaps he may be deceived, so we’ll get the better of him, and we’ll get our revenge on him.” 
JER.20.11	But 
JER.20.12	Yet, 
JER.20.13	Sing to 
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day I was born! The day that my mother bore me— may it never be blessed! 
JER.20.15	Cursed be the one who brought the news to my father, saying, “A baby boy is born to you!” making him so glad. 
JER.20.16	Now let that one be like the cities which 
JER.20.17	since he did not kill me in the womb, so my mother might have been my grave—her womb filled forever. 
JER.20.18	Why did I ever come forth out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow, and my days end in shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from 
JER.21.2	“Please inquire of 
JER.21.3	Then said Jeremiah to them, “Thus will you say to Zedekiah, 
JER.21.4	thus says 
JER.21.5	I myself will fight against you, with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even with anger, fury and in great wrath. 
JER.21.6	I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast—they will die of a great pestilence.’” 
JER.21.7	“Then afterward,” declares 
JER.21.8	Now to this people you will say, thus says 
JER.21.9	He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, or by the pestilence. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you, he will live, and he will have his life as prize.” 
JER.21.10	“For I have set My face against this city for evil, not for good.” It is a declaration of 
JER.21.11	Also to the house of the king of Judah, hear the word of 
JER.21.12	O house of David, thus says 
JER.21.13	“Here I am, against you, situated in the valley, a rocky plateau”—it is a declaration of 
JER.21.14	I will punish you according to the fruit of your deeds.” It is a declaration of 
JER.22.1	Thus said 
JER.22.2	‘Hear the word of 
JER.22.3	Thus says 
JER.22.4	For if you really carry out this word, then through the gates of this palace will enter kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—himself, his servants, and his people. 
JER.22.5	But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself,’ declares 
JER.22.6	For thus says 
JER.22.7	I will consecrate destroyers against you, each with his own weapons. They will cut down your choice cedars and cast them into the fire. 
JER.22.8	Many nations will pass by this city, and they will say, each to his neighbor, ‘Why has 
JER.22.9	Then they will answer: ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of 
JER.22.10	Weep not for the dead or bemoan him. Weep bitterly for him who departs, for he will never return, or see his native country again. 
JER.22.11	For thus says 
JER.22.12	Instead, in the place where they led him captive, there will he die—he will see this land no more.” 
JER.22.13	 to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his roof-chambers by injustice, that makes his neighbor work without pay, never giving him his wages, 
JER.22.14	who says: “I will build myself a big house with spacious rooms and cut out my windows for it, and panel it with cedar, and paint it with vermilion! 
JER.22.15	Did you become king just to be striving with cedar? Did your father not eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it went well with him. 
JER.22.16	He pled the case of the poor and weak, so it went well. Is not this knowledge of Me?” It is a declaration of 
JER.22.17	“But your eyes and your heart are only on your unjust gain, and on shedding innocent blood, and committing extortion and fraud.” 
JER.22.18	Therefore thus says 
JER.22.19	With a donkey’s burial will he be buried, dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem. 
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim— for all your lovers are broken. 
JER.22.21	I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, ‘I won’t listen!’ This has been your way since your youth— for you never listened to My voice. 
JER.22.22	The wind will shepherd away all of your shepherds, and your lovers will go into exile. Surely then you will be ashamed and humbled by all your wickedness. 
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, nestled in the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come on you, pain like a woman in travail! 
JER.22.24	“As I live,” declares 
JER.22.25	and give you over into the hand of those seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
JER.22.26	So I will cast you out, with your mother who bore you, into another country where you were not born—and there will you die. 
JER.22.27	But as for the land where they long to return, they will never return there.” 
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot— a jar with no delight in it? Why are he and his seed cast out into the land they do not know? 
JER.22.29	O land, land, land, hear the word of 
JER.22.30	Thus says 
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!” It is a declaration of 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus says 
JER.23.3	“I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds, and they will be fruitful and multiply. 
JER.23.4	I will raise up shepherds over them who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, nor will any be missing,” It is a declaration of 
JER.23.5	“Behold, days are coming” —it is a declaration of 
JER.23.6	In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell in safely; and this is His Name by which He will be called: 
JER.23.7	“Therefore behold, days are coming,” says 
JER.23.8	Rather, ‘As 
JER.23.9	As for the prophets: My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine because of 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers. The land mourns because of a curse. Pastures of the wilderness are dry. Their running is evil, and their might is not right. 
JER.23.11	For both prophet and 
JER.23.12	“Therefore their way will be for them like slippery places in the gloom. They will be driven away and fall there, for I will bring calamity on them, even the year of their visitation.” It is a declaration of 
JER.23.13	Moreover, I have seen unseemliness in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied by Baal, and led My people Israel astray. 
JER.23.14	But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: committing adultery and walking in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers. No one turns back from his evil. They are all like Sodom to Me and her inhabitants like Gomorrah.” 
JER.23.15	Therefore thus says 
JER.23.16	Thus says 
JER.23.17	They keep saying to those who despise Me, ‘
JER.23.18	For who has stood in the council of 
JER.23.19	Look, a storm of 
JER.23.20	The anger of 
JER.23.21	“I did not send those prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. 
JER.23.22	If they have stood in My council, then they would have announced My words to My people, and turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds.” 
JER.23.23	“Am I God only when near” —it is a declaration of 
JER.23.24	Can anyone hide himself in places so secret that I will not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth?” It is a declaration of 
JER.23.25	“I have heard what the prophets said, who prophesy lies in My Name, saying: ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’ 
JER.23.26	How long will this continue? Is there anything in the heart of such prophets prophesying lies? These prophets have deception in their heart. 
JER.23.27	Through their dreams that they each tell to his companion, that intend to make My people forget My Name—just as their fathers forgot My Name because of Baal. 
JER.23.28	“The prophet who has a dream may recount a dream, but let the one who has My word speak My word in truth. For what is straw compared with wheat?” It is a declaration of 
JER.23.29	“Is not My word like fire?” says 
JER.23.30	“Therefore here I am against the prophets”—it is a declaration of 
JER.23.31	Indeed, I am against the prophets”, declares 
JER.23.32	Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” declares 
JER.23.33	“Now when this people or a prophet or a 
JER.23.34	“As for the prophet or 
JER.23.35	Thus each of you may say to his companion and each one to his brother, ‘What has 
JER.23.36	But you should no longer remember ‘the burden of 
JER.23.37	“So you are to say to such a prophet, ‘What has 
JER.23.38	But if you say, ‘The burden of 
JER.23.39	therefore, I will surely forget you when I will cast you off, along with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from My presence. 
JER.23.40	Then I will bring everlasting disgrace on you and everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
JER.24.1	 showed me, all of a sudden, there were two baskets of figs set before the Temple of 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe, but the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
JER.24.3	Then 
JER.24.4	Then the word of 
JER.24.5	thus says 
JER.24.6	I will set My eyes on them as good. I will bring them back to this land, and I will build them up and not pull them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. 
JER.24.7	Then I will give them a heart to know Me—for I am 
JER.24.8	“Now as for the bad figs, which cannot be eaten they are so bad”—surely thus says 
JER.24.9	I will even give them as a horror, as an evil thing, among all the kingdoms of the earth—as a disgrace and a proverb, a taunt and a curse—in all places where I will drive them. 
JER.24.10	I will also send the sword, famine and pestilence among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.” 
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). 
JER.25.2	Jeremiah the prophet spoke it to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: 
JER.25.3	“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until this day—these 23 years—the word of 
JER.25.4	Moreover, 
JER.25.5	saying: ‘Turn, now, everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell in the land that 
JER.25.6	Do not go after other gods to serve them, to worship them, and so do not provoke Me with the work of your hands, so I would do you no harm.’ 
JER.25.7	“Yet you have not listened to Me,” declares 
JER.25.8	Therefore thus says 
JER.25.9	I will soon send for and bring all the families of the north”—it is a declaration of 
JER.25.10	“Moreover, I will silence among them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
JER.25.11	“So this whole land will be a desolate ruin, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years. 
JER.25.12	Then it will come to pass, when 70 years are completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” declares 
JER.25.13	I will bring on that land all My words which I pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them also. So I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their own hands.” 
JER.25.15	For thus says 
JER.25.16	They will drink, and reel to and fro, and be like madmen, because of the sword that I will send among them. 
JER.25.17	Then I took the cup from 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes—to make them an appalling horror and hissing, a curse as it is this day; 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes and all his people; 
JER.25.20	and all the mingled people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab, and Ammon’s children; 
JER.25.22	all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea; 
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who shave the corners; 
JER.25.24	all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed people dwelling in the wilderness; 
JER.25.25	all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media; 
JER.25.26	all the kings of the north, either far or close to another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach will drink after them.” 
JER.25.27	And you will say to them, thus says 
JER.25.28	And if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then here is what you will say to them: “Thus says 
JER.25.29	See, I am beginning to bring evil on the city where My name is called, and should you go completely unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth.” It is a declaration of 
JER.25.30	Therefore you are to prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: “
JER.25.31	A noise has come to the end of the earth, for 
JER.25.32	Thus says 
JER.25.33	Those slain by 
JER.25.34	Wail, you shepherds, and cry! Wallow in the dust, you leaders of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions are full. You will fall like a precious vase. 
JER.25.35	For the shepherds will have no way to flee, nor the leaders of the flock to escape. 
JER.25.36	Hark! The outcry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock! For 
JER.25.37	The peace of the pasture is stifled because of the fierce anger of 
JER.25.38	He has left His lair, like a lion. For their land has become a waste, because of the fury of the oppressor and because of His fierce anger. 
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from 
JER.26.2	thus says 
JER.26.3	Perhaps they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, so I may relent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.” 
JER.26.4	Then you will say to them, thus says 
JER.26.5	and by listening to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you, early and often—but you have not listened—
JER.26.6	then I will make this House like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.” 
JER.26.7	So the 
JER.26.8	Now when Jeremiah finished speaking all that 
JER.26.9	Why have you prophesied in the Name of 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s palace to the House of 
JER.26.11	The 
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying: “
JER.26.13	So now, mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of 
JER.26.14	“But as for me, here I am in your hand; do with me as is good and right in your eyes. 
JER.26.15	Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants. For in truth 
JER.26.16	Then said the princes and all the people to the 
JER.26.17	Then some of the elders of the land rose up and addressed all the assembly of the people, saying: 
JER.26.18	“Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, thus says 
JER.26.19	“Did King Hezekiah of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear 
JER.26.20	Now there was a man who had prophesied in the Name of 
JER.26.21	When King Jehoiakim with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard it, he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	So King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt—Elnathan son of Achbor and some others with him—
JER.26.23	and they brought Uriah back from Egypt, and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword and threw his corpse into the burial place of the common people. 
JER.26.24	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they did not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. 
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from 
JER.27.2	thus says 
JER.27.3	Then send such to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of Ammon’s children, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of messengers that come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. 
JER.27.4	Charge them to their masters, saying, thus says 
JER.27.5	‘I have made the earth, mankind and beast which are on the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm—and I give it to whom it seems right to Me. 
JER.27.6	So now I have given all these lands into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, My servant. I have even given the beasts of the field to serve him. 
JER.27.7	All the nations will serve him—and his son, and his grandson—until the time of his own land comes, and then many nations and great kings will make him their slave.’ 
JER.27.8	“Now it will be, that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve the same King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,” declares 
JER.27.9	But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreams, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’ 
JER.27.10	For they prophesy a lie to you, in order to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out and you would perish. 
JER.27.11	“But the nation that will bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, that nation I will let remain in its land, and they will till it and dwell in it.” It is a declaration of 
JER.27.12	Then I spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah with all these same words, saying: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people—and live. 
JER.27.13	Why should you die—you and your people—by the sword, by famine, or by pestilence, as 
JER.27.14	Do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you.” 
JER.27.15	“For I have not sent them,” says 
JER.27.16	Then I spoke to the 
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a ruin? 
JER.27.18	But if they are prophets, and if the word of 
JER.27.19	For thus says 
JER.27.20	which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has not taken, when he carried away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem, 
JER.27.21	yes, thus says 
JER.27.22	“They will be brought to Babylon, and there will they be until the day that I take note of them”—it is a declaration of 
JER.28.1	Now it was the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah son of Azzur the prophet from Gibeon spoke to me in the House of 
JER.28.2	thus says 
JER.28.3	Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of 
JER.28.4	I will also bring Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, back to this place with all the captives of Judah that went to Babylon”—it is a declaration of 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the 
JER.28.6	So the prophet Jeremiah said: “Amen! May 
JER.28.7	Yet hear now this word that I am speaking in your ears and in the ears of all the people. 
JER.28.8	The prophets who have been before me and before you of ancient times prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms—of war, catastrophe and plague. 
JER.28.9	The prophet who prophesies 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke-bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. 
JER.28.11	Hananiah proclaimed in the presence of all the people, saying, thus says 
JER.28.12	Then the word of 
JER.28.13	“Go, tell Hananiah, saying, thus says 
JER.28.14	For thus says 
JER.28.15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah to the prophet Hananiah: “Hear now, Hananiah! 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus says 
JER.28.17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the elders remaining in exile, as well as to the 
JER.29.2	(after Jeconiah the king, the queen-mother, the officers, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and the smiths, had to leave Jerusalem). The letter was sent 
JER.29.3	by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying, 
JER.29.4	thus says 
JER.29.5	“Build houses and live in them; also plant gardens and eat their fruit; 
JER.29.6	take wives and have sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and do not decrease. 
JER.29.7	Also seek the 
JER.29.8	For thus says 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely to you in My Name; I have not sent them.” It is a declaration of 
JER.29.10	For thus says 
JER.29.11	For I know the plans that I have in mind for you,” declares 
JER.29.12	“Then you will call on Me, and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 
JER.29.13	You will seek Me and find Me, when you will search for Me with all your heart. 
JER.29.14	Then I will be found by you,” says 
JER.29.15	For you have said: “
JER.29.16	For thus says 
JER.29.17	thus says 
JER.29.18	I will pursue them with the sword, famine and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth—a curse and an astonishment, a hissing and a disgrace—among all the nations where I have driven them, 
JER.29.19	because they have not listened to My words,” declares 
JER.29.20	“But you, hear the word of 
JER.29.21	thus says 
JER.29.22	So a curse will be taken up by everyone in exile from Judah who are in Babylon, saying: ‘May 
JER.29.23	because they have been disgraceful in Israel, committing adultery with their neighbors’ wives and speaking words in My Name falsely, which I did not command them. But I am the One who knows and I am witness.” It is a declaration of 
JER.29.24	Now concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you will surely say, 
JER.29.25	thus declares 
JER.29.26	‘
JER.29.27	So now, why haven’t you rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself out to be a prophet to you? 
JER.29.28	For he has sent word to us in Babylon, saying: “The exile will be long—build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit.’” 
JER.29.29	So Zephaniah the 
JER.29.30	Then the word of 
JER.29.31	Send word to all of the captivity, saying, thus says 
JER.29.32	therefore thus says 
JER.30.1	The word came to Jeremiah from 
JER.30.2	thus says 
JER.30.3	For behold, the days are coming,” declares 
JER.30.4	Now these are the words that 
JER.30.5	For thus says 
JER.30.6	Ask now, and see whether a man can give birth. Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman giving birth? Why have all faces turned pale? 
JER.30.7	 ! For that day is monumental. There will be none like it— a time of trouble for Jacob! Yet out of it he will be saved.
JER.30.8	It will be in that day” —it is a declaration of 
JER.30.9	Instead they will serve 
JER.30.10	So now, do not fear, Jacob My servant,” says 
JER.30.11	For I am with you,” declares 
JER.30.12	For thus says 
JER.30.13	No one pleads your cause, for there is no remedy for your wound, no healing for you. 
JER.30.14	All your lovers have forgotten you. They are not looking for you. For I wounded you as an enemy— with cruel punishment— because your iniquity is vast, your sins innumerable. 
JER.30.15	Why cry about your fracture? Your pain has no cure. Because your iniquity is vast, your sins innumerable, I did these things to you. 
JER.30.16	Yet all who devour you will be devoured, and all your foes—all of them— will go into captivity. Those plundering you will be plundered, and all preying on you I give as prey. 
JER.30.17	For I will restore health to you and will heal you of your wounds.” It is a declaration of 
JER.30.18	Thus says 
JER.30.19	Out of them will come thanksgiving and the sound of celebration. I will multiply them, so they will not decrease. I will also honor them, so they will not be insignificant. 
JER.30.20	His children also will be as formerly —his community set up before Me— and I will punish all his oppressors. 
JER.30.21	His noble one will be one of His own. His ruler will come forth from among His own. I will bring Him near, and He will approach Me. For who is he who will pledge his heart to approach Me?” It is a declaration of 
JER.30.22	“So you will be My people, and I will be your God.” 
JER.30.23	Look! A storm of 
JER.30.24	’s fierce anger will not turn back until He has done it, until He fulfills the purposes of His heart. in the last days you will understand it.
JER.30.25	“At that time,” declares 
JER.31.1	Thus says 
JER.31.2	“From afar 
JER.31.3	Again I will build you, so you will be rebuilt, virgin Israel! Again you will take up your tambourines as ornaments, and go out to dances of merrymakers. 
JER.31.4	Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria— planters will plant and use them. 
JER.31.5	For there will be a day when watchmen will call out in the hill country of Ephraim, ‘Arise, let us go up to Zion, to 
JER.31.6	For thus says 
JER.31.7	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and I will gather them from the ends of the earth— among them the blind and the lame, the pregnant together with she who is in labor with child. A great throng will return here. 
JER.31.8	With weeping and supplications they will come. I will bring them, leading them to walk by streams of water on a straight path where they will not stumble. For I am Israel’s father, and Ephraim is My firstborn.” 
JER.31.9	Hear the word of 
JER.31.10	For 
JER.31.11	They will come and sing on Zion’s height, radiant over the bounty of 
JER.31.12	Then will the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old men together. For I will turn their mourning into joy, and I will comfort them, and make them rejoice out of their sorrow. 
JER.31.13	I will fill the soul of the 
JER.31.14	Thus says 
JER.31.15	Thus says 
JER.31.16	So there is hope for your future” —it is declaration of 
JER.31.17	I indeed heard Ephraim grieving: ‘You have disciplined me— I was disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me, and I will return, for you are 
JER.31.18	For after I returned, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I struck my thigh— I was ashamed and also humiliated, for I bore the disgrace of my youth.’ 
JER.31.19	Is Ephraim a precious son to Me? Is he a delightful child? For as often as I spoke against him, I still certainly remember him. Therefore My heart yearns for him. I will surely have compassion on him.” It is a declaration of 
JER.31.20	Erect road markers, set up signposts! Set your heart toward the highway, the way by which you traveled! Return, O virgin Israel, return to your cities. 
JER.31.21	How long will you waver, O backsliding daughter? For 
JER.31.22	Thus says 
JER.31.23	Judah and all its cities will dwell there together—the farmer and those who go about with flocks. 
JER.31.24	For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul will refresh.” 
JER.31.25	At this point I awoke, and looked around, and my sleep was sweet to me. 
JER.31.26	“Behold, days are coming”—it is a declaration of 
JER.31.27	Now just as I have watched over them to uproot and to pull down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to bring disaster, then I will watch over them to build and to plant,” says 
JER.31.28	“In those days they will no longer say: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are blunted.’ 
JER.31.29	Rather each will die for his own iniquity: if anyone eats the sour grapes, his own teeth will be blunted.”
JER.31.30	“Behold, days are coming” —it is a declaration of 
JER.31.31	not like the covenant I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. For they broke My covenant, though I was a husband to them.” it is a declaration of 
JER.31.32	“But this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days” —it is a declaration of 
JER.31.33	No longer will each teach his neighbor or each his brother, saying: ‘Know 
JER.31.34	Thus says 
JER.31.35	“Only if this fixed order departs from before Me” —it is a declaration of 
JER.31.36	Thus says 
JER.31.37	“Behold, days are coming”—it is a declaration of 
JER.31.38	The measuring line will go out farther, straight to the Gareb Hill, then turn to Goah. 
JER.31.39	Then the whole valley—the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields up to the Kidron Valley to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east—will be holy to 
JER.32.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from 
JER.32.2	Now at the time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the palace of the king of Judah. 
JER.32.3	For King Zedekiah of Judah had shut him up, saying: “Why do you prophesy and say, thus says 
JER.32.4	and King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes will behold his eyes; 
JER.32.5	and he will lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there will he remain until I take note of him,’ says 
JER.32.6	So Jeremiah said: “The word of 
JER.32.7	‘Hanamel, son of Shallum your uncle, will soon come to you saying: ‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.’” 
JER.32.8	So my uncle’s son Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard as was the word of 
JER.32.9	So I bought the field that was in Anathoth from the son of my uncle Hanamel, and weighed him the money—seventeen shekels of silver. 
JER.32.10	I signed and sealed the deed, called in witnesses, and weighed the money on the scales. 
JER.32.11	Then I took the purchase deed, both the sealed copy, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy, 
JER.32.12	and I gave the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my uncle’s son Hanamel and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the purchase deed, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. 
JER.32.13	Then I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
JER.32.14	thus says 
JER.32.15	For thus says 
JER.32.16	After I had given the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to 
JER.32.17	“Ah, my Lord 
JER.32.18	You are the One doing mercy to thousands, but repaying the iniquity of the fathers into the lap of their children after them. Great, mighty God, 
JER.32.19	Great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds. 
JER.32.20	You set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day in Israel and among mankind, and made Yourself a Name, as to this day. 
JER.32.21	You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror. 
JER.32.22	You gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
JER.32.23	They came in and possessed it. But they did not obey your voice nor walk in your 
JER.32.24	Look, the siege ramps have just come up to the city to take it. The city has been handed over to the Chaldeans fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence. What You have spoken has happened. Here it is, You see it. 
JER.32.25	Yet You said to me, my Lord 
JER.32.26	Then came the word of 
JER.32.27	“Behold, I am 
JER.32.28	Therefore thus says 
JER.32.29	Then the Chaldeans fighting against this city will come and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses—where they burned incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke Me. 
JER.32.30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight from their youth; indeed, the children of Israel have done nothing but provoke Me with the work of their hands,” declares 
JER.32.31	“Indeed this city has caused My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it up to this day, so that I will remove it from before My face, 
JER.32.32	because of all the evil the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done to provoke Me—they, their kings, their princes, their 
JER.32.33	“They have turned their back to Me and not their face. Though I taught them early and often, they have not listened to receive instruction. 
JER.32.34	Instead they set up their abominations in the House where My Name is called, to defile it. 
JER.32.35	They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters pass through fire to Molech—something I never commanded them, nor did it enter My mind that they would do this loathsome thing, causing Judah to sin.” 
JER.32.36	Now therefore thus says 
JER.32.37	“See, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in My anger, My fury, and great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place and cause them to dwell securely. 
JER.32.38	They will be My people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will give them one heart and one way, so they may fear Me forever; for their good and for their children after them. 
JER.32.40	I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never turn away from doing good for them. I will put My fear in their hearts, so that they will not depart from Me. 
JER.32.41	“Yes, I will delight in doing good for them, and with all My heart and all My soul I will in truth plant them in this land.” 
JER.32.42	For thus says 
JER.32.43	So fields will be bought in this land, about which you are saying: ‘It will be a desolation, without man or beast; it is handed over to the Chaldeans.’ 
JER.32.44	Men will buy fields for money and sign and seal the deeds and call witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the areas around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, in the towns of the hill-country, in the towns of the foothills, and in the cities of the South—because I will bring them back from exile.” It is a declaration of 
JER.33.1	Then the word of 
JER.33.2	Thus says 
JER.33.3	“Call to Me, and I will answer you— I will tell you great and hidden things, which you do not know.” 
JER.33.4	For thus says 
JER.33.5	they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans, but they are about to fill them with the dead bodies of the people whom I will slay in My anger and in My fury. I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness. 
JER.33.6	“Indeed, I will bring it health and healing, and I will surely heal them. I will reveal to them an abundance of 
JER.33.7	I will restore Judah from exile and Israel from exile, and will rebuild them, as in former times. 
JER.33.8	I will also cleanse them from all their iniquity in which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their wrongs in which they have sinned against Me and in which they have rebelled against Me. 
JER.33.9	“Then this city will be to Me for a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do for them, so they will fear and tremble because of all the good and for all the 
JER.33.10	Thus says 
JER.33.11	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them who say: ‘Give thanks to 
JER.33.12	Thus says 
JER.33.13	In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the foothills, in the towns of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, will the flocks again pass under the hands of one who counts them,” declares 
JER.33.14	“Behold, days are coming” —it is a declaration of 
JER.33.15	In those days and at that time, I will cause a Branch of Righteousness to spring up for David, and He will execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
JER.33.16	In those days will Judah be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell safely. And this is the Name by which He will be called: 
JER.33.17	For thus says 
JER.33.18	nor will the Levitical 
JER.33.19	And the word of 
JER.33.20	thus says 
JER.33.21	only then may My covenant be broken with My servant David, that he would not have a son to reign on his throne, and the Levitical 
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David My servant, and the Levites who minister to Me.” 
JER.33.23	The word of 
JER.33.24	“Have you not noticed what this people have spoken, saying: ‘The two families which 
JER.33.25	Thus says 
JER.33.26	only then would I reject the offspring of Jacob, and of My servant David so that I would not take from his offspring rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore them from their exile, and have compassion on them.”
JER.34.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from 
JER.34.2	thus says 
JER.34.3	and you will not escape out of his hand, but will surely be captured and given into his hand. Your eyes will behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth, and you will go to Babylon.” 
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of 
JER.34.5	you will die in peace. As there were burning ceremonies for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you, and they will lament for you: ‘
JER.34.6	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem, 
JER.34.7	when the army of the king of Babylon was warring against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left—against Lachish and against Azekah, for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities. 
JER.34.8	The word that came to Jeremiah from 
JER.34.9	so that everyone should let his manservant and his maidservant—Hebrew man or Hebrew woman—go free, so that no one should make a slave of a Jew, his brother. 
JER.34.10	So all the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone would free his manservant and his maidservant and not make them slaves any more—they obeyed, and freed them. 
JER.34.11	But afterward they turned around and made the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, return, and brought them back into subjection as servants and as handmaids.” 
JER.34.12	So the word of 
JER.34.13	thus says 
JER.34.14	‘At the end of seven years you are to set free every man his brother that is a Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you are let him go free from you.’ But your fathers did not obey Me, nor inclined their ear. 
JER.34.15	Now you had repented, and had done that which is right in My eyes, by proclaiming liberty everyone to his neighbor. You even had made a covenant before Me in the House where My Name is called. 
JER.34.16	But you turned around and profaned My Name, and made everyone his servant and his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their will, return, and you brought them back into subjection, to be your servants and handmaids.” 
JER.34.17	Therefore thus says 
JER.34.18	I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts
JER.34.19	—the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, the 
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them who seek their life, and their dead bodies will be for food to the birds of the sky and to the beasts of the earth. 
JER.34.21	King Zedekiah of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, who were withdrawing from you. 
JER.34.22	Indeed, I will command,” declares 
JER.35.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from 
JER.35.2	“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them into one of the chambers of the House of 
JER.35.3	So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, his brothers and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, 
JER.35.4	and I brought them into the House of 
JER.35.5	I set jars full of wine and cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites, and said to them: “Drink wine!” 
JER.35.6	But they said: “We drink no wine, for Jonadab son of Rechab our father commanded us: ‘You will drink no wine, not you nor your sons, forever. 
JER.35.7	Also you are not to build a house, or sow seed, or plant a vineyard or own one. Instead all your days you are to dwell in tents, so that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’ 
JER.35.8	So we obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab our father in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters, 
JER.35.9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in, nor to own a vineyard, field or seed, 
JER.35.10	and we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said: ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Arameans. So we are dwelling in Jerusalem.” 
JER.35.12	Then came the word of 
JER.35.13	thus says 
JER.35.14	“The words of Jonadab son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are observed, and to this day they drink none, for they listen to their father’s commandment. Yet I have spoken to you, early and often, and you have not obeyed Me. 
JER.35.15	“I have sent also to you all My servants the prophets, sending them early and often, saying: ‘Return you now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers; but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to Me. 
JER.35.16	For the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have kept the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people have not obeyed Me.’” 
JER.35.17	Therefore thus says 
JER.35.18	Now Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, thus says 
JER.35.19	therefore thus says 
JER.36.1	Now it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of King Josiah of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from 
JER.36.2	“Take a 
JER.36.3	Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity that I am planning to do to them, in order that they may turn, each one from his evil way. Then I would forgive their iniquity and their sin.” 
JER.36.4	So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from Jeremiah’s mouth, all the words that 
JER.36.5	Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying: “I am detained; I cannot go into the House of 
JER.36.6	So you go and read in the 
JER.36.7	Perhaps they will present their supplication before 
JER.36.8	So Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that the prophet Jeremiah commanded him, reading from the book the words of 
JER.36.9	Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of King Josiah of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before 
JER.36.10	Then Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the House of 
JER.36.11	Now when Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan, had heard from the scroll all the words of 
JER.36.12	he went down to the scribe’s chamber of the king’s palace. All the officials sat there—the scribe Elishama, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the officials. 
JER.36.13	Then Micaiah reported to them all the words that he had heard Baruch reading out of the scroll in the ears of the people. 
JER.36.14	All the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying: “Bring in your hand the 
JER.36.15	Then they said to him: “Sit down now, and read it in our ears.” So Baruch read it in their ears. 
JER.36.16	After they had heard all the words, they turned to each other in fear, then said to Baruch: “We will surely report all these words to the king.” 
JER.36.17	They also asked Baruch, saying: “Tell us now, how did you write all these words? At his dictation?” 
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them: “He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink into the scroll.” 
JER.36.19	Then the officials said to Baruch: “Go, hide yourself—you and Jeremiah—and let no one know where you are.” 
JER.36.20	Then they went to the king in the courtyard, after they had deposited the 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the 
JER.36.22	Since it was the ninth month, the king was residing in the winter house, with a fireplace burning before him. 
JER.36.23	Now as soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns, he cut it with the scribe’s knife and tossed it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the whole 
JER.36.24	Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words were afraid, nor tore their clothes. 
JER.36.25	Moreover Elnatan, Delaiah and Gemariah entreated the king not to burn the 
JER.36.26	Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, along with Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah—but 
JER.36.27	Then the word of 
JER.36.28	“Take yet another 
JER.36.29	About King Jehoiakim of Judah you will say, thus says 
JER.36.30	Therefore thus says 
JER.36.31	I will also punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the calamity that I have pronounced against them—but they did not listen.” 
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another 
JER.37.1	Now Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 
JER.37.2	But neither he nor his servants, nor the people of the land, paid attention to the words of 
JER.37.3	Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying: “Pray now to 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah was coming in and going out among the people, for they had not put him into prison. 
JER.37.5	Meanwhile Pharaoh’s army had set out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the siege from Jerusalem. 
JER.37.6	Then came the word of 
JER.37.7	Thus says 
JER.37.8	The Chaldeans will return and fight against this city. Then they will capture it and burn it with fire.” 
JER.37.9	Thus says 
JER.37.10	For even if you had struck down the entire Chaldean army fighting against you, and there were left among them only wounded men, each in his tent, they would get up and burn this city down with fire.” 
JER.37.11	So it came to pass, when the army of the Chaldeans went up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 
JER.37.12	that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people. 
JER.37.13	But when he was at the Benjamin Gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah, who arrested the prophet Jeremiah, saying: “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!” 
JER.37.14	But Jeremiah said, “That’s a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” But Irijah would not listen to him, but arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
JER.37.15	The officials were angry with Jeremiah, had him beaten, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made that the prison. 
JER.37.16	For Jeremiah went into a vaulted cell in the dungeon pit, and Jeremiah remained there many days. 
JER.37.17	Then King Zedekiah sent for him and received him in his palace secretly, and the king asked him: “Is there any word from 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah: “How have I sinned against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying: ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land?’ 
JER.37.20	So now please listen, my lord the king! Please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so I will not die there.” 
JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king gave a command, and they committed Jeremiah into the courtyard of the guard. They gave him a loaf of bread from the bakers’ street daily, until all the bread in the city was spent. So Jeremiah stayed in the guard’s courtyard. 
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,
JER.38.2	thus says 
JER.38.3	Thus says 
JER.38.4	Then the officials said to the king: “This man should now be put to death, since he demoralizes the men of war remaining in this city as well as all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the 
JER.38.5	Then King Zedekiah said: “Here he is in your hand. For the king cannot do anything against you.” 
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern-pit of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard, lowering Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the pit there was no water, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud. 
JER.38.7	Now Ebed-melech—an Ethiopian official in the king’s palace—heard they had put Jeremiah in the pit. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, 
JER.38.8	Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying: 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they cast into the pit. He is likely to die right where he is from hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.” 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: “Take thirty men from here with you, and bring the prophet Jeremiah up out of the cistern, before he dies.” 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the king’s palace under the storehouse, from there he took worn-out clothes and worn-out rags, and lowered them by ropes into the cistern-pit to Jeremiah. 
JER.38.12	And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah: “Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes.” Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	Then they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes, and lifted him up out of the pit. But Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. 
JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent for the prophet Jeremiah and received him at the third entrance in the House of 
JER.38.15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: “If I tell you, won’t you surely put me to death? Besides, if I give you counsel, you won’t listen to me.” 
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying: “As 
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: Thus says 
JER.38.18	But if you do not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans; they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape out of their hand.” 
JER.38.19	Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah: “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they hand me over to them and they abuse me.” 
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said: “They will not hand you over. Please, obey the voice of 
JER.38.21	But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word that 
JER.38.22	‘Soon, all the women who are left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon, and those women will say: “Your close friends have misled you, and prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, and they deserted you.’” 
JER.38.23	“Then they will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans, and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down with fire.” 
JER.38.24	Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah: “Let no one know of these words, and you will not die. 
JER.38.25	“But if the officials hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you: ‘Tell us now what you have said to the king—hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death. And what did the king say to you?’ 
JER.38.26	Then you will tell them, ‘I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to Jonathan’s house to die there.’” 
JER.38.27	When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he told them with just these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, since the matter was not overheard. 
JER.38.28	Then Jeremiah stayed in the guard’s courtyard until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	Now when Jerusalem was captured, in the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all his army advanced against Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
JER.39.2	On the ninth day of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the city wall was broken through. 
JER.39.3	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sarezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sarezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of Babylon’s king. 
JER.39.4	Now when King Zedekiah of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled. They went out of the city at night, by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, heading out toward the way of the Arabah. 
JER.39.5	But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they captured him, they brought him up to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed judgment on him. 
JER.39.6	The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes. Moreover, the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Then he blinded Zedekiah’s eyes, and he bound him in shackles to carry him off to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	Then the Chaldeans burned the king’s palace and the houses of the people with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile the rest of the people—those who remained in the city and also the deserters who had defected to him, and the rest of the people remaining. 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the people, who had nothing, behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields in that day.
JER.39.11	Now King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying: 
JER.39.12	“Take him, and look after him, and do no harm to him; rather, do to him just as he tells you.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent word, so Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sarezer the Rab-mag and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon 
JER.39.14	sent and brought Jeremiah out of the guard’s courtyard, and gave him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he dwelt among the people. 
JER.39.15	Now the word of 
JER.39.16	“Go, speak to Eved-melech the Ethiopian, saying, thus says 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver you in that day—it is a declaration of 
JER.39.18	“For I will surely rescue you, so you will not fall by the sword. But you will keep your life as spoils, because you put your trust in Me.” It is a declaration of 
JER.40.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from 
JER.40.2	Now the captain of the guard had taken Jeremiah and said to him: “
JER.40.3	and 
JER.40.4	But now behold, I am freeing you this day from the chains that are on your hand. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if it is evil in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, stop. Look, the whole land is before you—wherever it seems good and right to you to go, there go.” 
JER.40.5	But he would not turn back. “Go back then to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go anywhere it seems right in your eyes to go.” Then the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift, and let him go. 
JER.40.6	So Jeremiah went to the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
JER.40.7	Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land, and had put him in charge of the men, and women and children, the poorest of the land who were not carried away captive to Babylon. 
JER.40.8	So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—including Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite—they and their men. 
JER.40.9	Then Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying: “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you. 
JER.40.10	As for me, look, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who come to us. But as for you, gather wine, summer fruit and oil, and put them in your jars, and dwell in your cities that you have taken over.” 
JER.40.11	Also when all the Jews who were in Moab, among Ammon’s children, in Edom, and in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, 
JER.40.12	then all the Jews returned out of all places where they had been driven, and came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruit in great abundance. 
JER.40.13	Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah to Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Are you aware that Baalis the king of Ammon’s children has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them. 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah at Mizpah, saying, “Let me go now, and I will slay Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews that are gathered to you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?’ 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do this thing! For what you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
JER.41.1	Now it was in the seventh month, that Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama—of royal descent and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men—came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam to Mizpah. While they were eating bread there together in Mizpah, 
JER.41.2	Ishmael son of Nethaniah rose up with the ten men that were with him and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan with the sword—putting to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were found there. 
JER.41.4	Now it was the next day after he had slain Gedaliah, when no one knew about it, 
JER.41.5	that 80 men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, with their beards shaved off, their clothes rent, and having gashed themselves, with grain offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring to the House of 
JER.41.6	So Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went, and as he came to meet them, he said to them: “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” 
JER.41.7	Yet it was that as soon as they came within of the city that Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them within the cistern-pit. 
JER.41.8	However ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael: “Don’t kill us! For we have hidden stores in the field—wheat, barley, oil and honey!” So he held off and did not kill them along with their companions. 
JER.41.9	Now the cistern where Ishmael cast all the corpses of the men whom he killed, because they were on Gedaliah’s side, was the one which King Asa had made for fear of King Baasa of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. 
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people that were in Mizpah, including the king’s daughters—all the people who were left in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had put under the charge of Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and set off to cross over to Ammon’s children. 
JER.41.11	But Johanan son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard about all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done. 
JER.41.12	So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great pool in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad. 
JER.41.14	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to Ammon’s children. 
JER.41.16	Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had rescued from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpah, after he had murdered Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the men, the soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he had brought back from Gibeon—
JER.41.17	and they left and stayed at Chimham’s lodge, which is near Beth-lehem, in order to go on to enter Egypt, 
JER.41.18	away from the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, since Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. 
JER.42.1	Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached 
JER.42.2	and said to the prophet Jeremiah, “Please, let our petition be presented before you, and pray to 
JER.42.3	that 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them: “I have heard you. Agreed: I will pray to 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah: “Let 
JER.42.6	Whether it be good or evil, we will obey the voice of 
JER.42.7	Now it was at the end of ten days that the word of 
JER.42.8	Then he called Johanan son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest, 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “Thus says 
JER.42.10	‘If you will still stay in this land, then will I build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you. For I will relent concerning the calamity that I have done to you. 
JER.42.11	Do not be not afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you dread—do not be afraid of him”—it is a declaration of 
JER.42.12	I will also show you compassion and he will have compassion on you, and restore you to your own soil. 
JER.42.13	But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ so that you do not obey the voice of 
JER.42.14	saying: ‘No, instead we’ll go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war or hear the sound of a 
JER.42.15	now therefore hear the word of 
JER.42.16	then it will come to pass that the sword, which you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine about which you are anxious will follow hard after you there in Egypt—and there you will die. 
JER.42.17	So will it be for all the people who set their faces to enter Egypt to sojourn there—they will die by the sword, by famine and by plague. So none of them will remain or escape from the calamity that I will bring on them.’” 
JER.42.18	For thus says 
JER.42.19	 has spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah: “Do not go to Egypt. Know for sure that I have forewarned you this day! 
JER.42.20	For you have led your own souls in error, since it was you who sent me to 
JER.42.21	So I have this day declared it to you, but you will not obey the voice of 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know for sure that you will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague, in the place whither you desired to go to sojourn there.”
JER.43.1	But when Jeremiah had made an end of telling all the people all the words of 
JER.43.2	then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the insolent men responded, saying to Jeremiah: “You are telling a lie! 
JER.43.3	Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they may put us to death or carry us away as captives to Babylon!” 
JER.43.4	So Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the forces and all the people, did not obey the voice of 
JER.43.5	But Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven to dwell in the land of Judah—
JER.43.6	the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, everyone that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah—
JER.43.7	and they went to the land of Egypt. For they did not obey the voice of 
JER.43.8	the word of 
JER.43.9	“Take some large stones in your hand and hide them in the mortar in the brickwork at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah. 
JER.43.10	Then say to them, thus says 
JER.43.11	Yes, he will come, and will strike the land of Egypt. Those for death—to death! Those for exile—to exile! Those for the sword—to the sword! 
JER.43.12	“I will also set fire to the houses of Egypt’s gods. He will burn them and carry them off. He will wrap himself up with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself up with his garment. Then he will depart from there victoriously. 
JER.43.13	“He will also shatter the pillars of the temple of the sun in the land of Egypt, while houses of the gods of Egypt He will burn with fire.”
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt—at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Noph, and in the region of Pathros, saying, 
JER.44.2	thus says 
JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke Me, by continuing to burn sacrifices for and serve other gods, whom they had not known—not they, nor you, nor your fathers. 
JER.44.4	Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, sending them early and often, saying: ‘Oh, do not do this loathsome thing that I hate.’ 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to stop making offering to other gods. 
JER.44.6	“Therefore My fury and Mine anger was poured out and blazed in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. So they are waste and a ruin, as it is today. 
JER.44.7	So now, thus says 
JER.44.8	You are provoking Me with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have come to dwell, so that you will be cut off and become a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth. 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, the evils of the kings of Judah, the evils of their wives, and your own evils and the evils of your wives, which were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My 
JER.44.11	Therefore thus says 
JER.44.12	I will take the remnant of Judah who set their faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they will all be consumed, falling in the land of Egypt by the sword and by famine. They will die, from the least to the greatest, by the sword and by famine, and they will be an execration, and a horror, a curse, and a disgrace. 
JER.44.13	So I will punish those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by plague. 
JER.44.14	So none of the remnant of Judah entering the land of Egypt to sojourn there will escape or remain, to return to the land of Judah, when they are longing with their soul to return to live there; for none will return except as refugees.” 
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women that stood by—a large assembly—with all the people dwelling in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying: 
JER.44.16	“As for the word that you spoke to us in the Name of 
JER.44.17	Instead we will definitely do every word as went out of our mouth—burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we did, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—for then we had plenty of food, were well off, and saw no calamity. 
JER.44.18	But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine. 
JER.44.19	Moreover, when we were burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, when we made cakes for her in her image and poured out drink offerings to her, were we without our husbands?” 
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and the women, to all the people that were giving him such an answer, saying: 
JER.44.21	“The incense-burning that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land—
JER.44.22	Then 
JER.44.23	Because you have burned incense, because you have sinned against 
JER.44.24	Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women: “Hear the word of 
JER.44.25	Thus says 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear the word of 
JER.44.27	Here I am, watching over them for evil, and not for good. All the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them. 
JER.44.28	Those escaping the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah only few in number. Then the remnant of Judah who entered the land of Egypt to sojourn there, will know whose word stands up—Mine or theirs!” It is a declaration of 
JER.44.29	“Moreover, this will be the sign to you: I will visit punishment on you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you as calamity.” 
JER.44.30	Thus says 
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, 
JER.45.2	thus says 
JER.45.3	‘
JER.45.4	Thus shall you say to him, thus says 
JER.45.5	But you, are you expecting great things for yourself? Seek no more! For I am about to bring calamity on all flesh”—it is a declaration of 
JER.46.1	The word of 
JER.46.2	For Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah. 
JER.46.3	“Arrange breastplate and shield! Advance to battle! 
JER.46.4	Harness the horses and mount, O horsemen! Take your position, with helmets! Polish the spears! Put on armor! 
JER.46.5	Why have I seen them? They are shattered, retreating, their warriors beaten, fleeing for cover, no turning back, terror on every side!” It is a declaration of 
JER.46.6	“The swift cannot flee, nor the warrior escape. In the north by the river Euphrates They stumbled and fell. 
JER.46.7	Who is this, rising like the Nile, like the rivers whose waters churn? 
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile, like the rivers whose waters churn. He says: ‘I will rise up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and its inhabitants!’ 
JER.46.9	Prance, you horses, and rush madly, you chariots. Let the warriors go out— Cush and Put grasping the shield, Lydians grasping and bending the bow! 
JER.46.10	For that day belongs to my Lord 
JER.46.11	Go up into Gilead and get balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain you use many medicines— there is no cure for you. 
JER.46.12	Nations have heard of your shame, and your outcry fills the earth. For warrior stumbles over warrior— both fall down together.” 
JER.46.13	The word that 
JER.46.14	“Declare it in Egypt, proclaim in Migdol, and announce in Noph and Tahpanhes. Say: ‘Stand up and get ready! For the sword has devoured all around you. 
JER.46.15	Why are your strong ones swept away? They did not stand up, because 
JER.46.16	They keep stumbling, yes, falling over each other. Then they said: ‘Get up! Let’s return to our own people, to the land of our birth, away from the oppressor’s sword.’ 
JER.46.17	They cried there: ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise! He let the opportune time pass.’ 
JER.46.18	As I live,” declares the King —whose Name is 
JER.46.19	O daughter dwelling in Egypt, get your bags ready for exile! For Noph will become a ruin laid waste, uninhabited. 
JER.46.20	Egypt is a beautiful heifer— but a biting fly is coming— from the north it is coming! 
JER.46.21	Even her mercenaries among her are like stall-fed calves, for they also will turn back— they will flee away together, they will not stand up— for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their visitation. 
JER.46.22	Its sound will hiss like a snake, as they march with an army, and come against her as woodcutters with axes. 
JER.46.23	They cut down her forest” —it is a declaration of 
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt is disgraced, handed over to people of the north.” 
JER.46.25	, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will punish Amon of No, Pharaoh, Egypt, with her gods and her kings—even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him. 
JER.46.26	I will hand them over to those seeking their lives, into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his servants. Yet afterwards it will be inhabited, as in the days of old.” It is a declaration of 
JER.46.27	“But you, fear not, Jacob My servant, nor be dismayed, O Israel. For behold, I will save you from afar, your offspring from the land of their exile. And Jacob will return and be at peace and secure, no one frightening him. 
JER.46.28	Fear not, Jacob My servant” —it is a declaration of 
JER.47.1	The word of 
JER.47.2	Thus says 
JER.47.3	The noise— the stomping hooves of his stallions, the rumbling of his chariots, the reverberation of his wheels! Fathers will not turn back for their children because of their limp hands. 
JER.47.4	For the day is coming to devastate all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally. For 
JER.47.5	Baldness has come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is ruined. O remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourself? 
JER.47.6	O sword of 
JER.47.7	How can you be quiet when 
JER.48.1	Concerning Moab, thus says 
JER.48.2	There is no more praise for Moab. In Heshbon they plotted evil against her: ‘Come, let’s cut her off as a nation.’ You too, Madmen, will be silenced— the sword will chase you. 
JER.48.3	The sound of outcry from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction! 
JER.48.4	Moab is shattered—her little ones have raised a cry to be heard. 
JER.48.5	For at the ascent of Luhith they go up with continual weeping. For on the descent to Horonaim they heard the foe’s shattering cry. 
JER.48.6	Flee! Escape with your lives! Be like a tamarisk in the wilderness. 
JER.48.7	For because of your trust in your works and your treasures, you will be captured, too. Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and princes. 
JER.48.8	The destroyer will come to every town. No town will escape. The valley will perish and the plain will be destroyed, as 
JER.48.9	Give wings to Moab, for she must fly and get away. Her cities will become a wasteland, with no one living in them. 
JER.48.10	Cursed is the one who does the work of 
JER.48.11	Moab has been at ease since his youth. He has settled like wine on its dregs. He has not been emptied from jar to jar, nor gone into exile. Therefore he retains his flavor, and his aroma has not changed. 
JER.48.12	Therefore behold, days are coming” —it is a declaration of 
JER.48.13	So Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. 
JER.48.14	How can you say: ‘We are warriors and men valiant for battle’? 
JER.48.15	Moab is ravaged, its towns entered, its choice young men gone down to slaughter” —It is a declaration of the King, whose Name is 
JER.48.16	“Moab’s calamity will come soon, and his downfall hastens swiftly. 
JER.48.17	Mourn for him, all who are around him, all who know his name. Say: ‘How the mighty scepter, the splendid rod, is broken!’ 
JER.48.18	O daughter dwelling in Dibon come down from your glory and sit in thirst! For Moab’s destroyer has come to you. He has devastated your strongholds. 
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the road and watch— ask him fleeing and her escaping, ‘What has happened?’ 
JER.48.20	Moab is disgraced, indeed shattered. Wail and shriek! Declare by the Arnon, Moab is ruined! 
JER.48.21	Judgment has come on the tableland —on Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath, 
JER.48.22	on Dibon, Nebo, Beth-diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon, 
JER.48.24	on Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near. 
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken!” It is a declaration of 
JER.48.26	“Make him drunk, for he exalted himself against 
JER.48.27	After all, Israel is a laughingstock to you. Was he ever found among thieves, that whenever you speak of him, you should wag the head? 
JER.48.28	Inhabitants of Moab, leave the towns and dwell in crags— like a dove nesting in a cave’s mouth. 
JER.48.29	We have heard of the pride of Moab —very proud he is—his haughtiness, his arrogance, his insolence, and his self-exalted heart. 
JER.48.30	I know his arrogance,” says 
JER.48.31	Therefore I wail for Moab! Yes, I cry out for all Moab, for the men of Kir-heres I moan. 
JER.48.32	More than weeping of Jazer will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah! Your branches spread to the sea, reached as far as the sea of Jazer. On your summer fruits and your vintage the destroyer has fallen. 
JER.48.33	So joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab. I stopped wine from the winepresses. No one will tread with shouting— any shouting is not a shout of joy.” 
JER.48.34	“From the outcry of Heshbon to Elealeh, as far as Jahaz they will raise their voice—from Zoar to Horonaim and a 3-year old heifer—for the Waters of Nimrim also will be waste. 
JER.48.35	Moreover I will make an end in Moab”—it is a declaration of 
JER.48.36	“That is why my heart is moaning like funeral flutes for Moab, and my heart moans like flutes for the people of Kir-heres. Thus the wealth he made is lost. 
JER.48.37	For every head is bald, every beard clipped, on all the hands are gashes, and around the waist sackcloth. 
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab and in its squares— lamentation everywhere! For I have broken Moab like a jar In which no one delights” —it is a declaration of 
JER.48.39	“‘How shattered it is!’ they wailed! ‘How Moab turned his back in shame!’ So Moab will become a laughingstock and a horror to all around him.” 
JER.48.40	For thus says 
JER.48.41	The towns are captured, the strongholds seized. The hearts of Moab’s warriors in that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor. 
JER.48.42	Moab will be destroyed as a people, because he boasted against 
JER.48.43	Panic, pit and trap, are upon you, inhabitant of Moab,” declares 
JER.48.44	“The one who flees from panic will fall into the pit, and one who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap. For I will bring on Moab the year of their visitation.” It is a declaration of 
JER.48.45	“In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stop, exhausted, for fire breaks out of Heshbon flame from within Sihon, and it singes the foreheads and the scalps of Moab’s noisy sons. 
JER.48.46	 to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished! For your sons are taken away captive and your daughters into exile. 
JER.48.47	Yet I will restore Moab from exile in the end of days.” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.1	About Ammon’s children, thus says 
JER.49.2	Therefore behold, days are coming” —it is a declaration of 
JER.49.3	“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated! Cry, daughters of Rabbah! Wear sackcloth, lament, and run to and fro within the walls, for Malcam will go into captivity together with his priests and princes. 
JER.49.4	Why do you brag about valleys— your flowing valley, faithless daughter? Trusting in your treasures: ‘Who will come against me?’ 
JER.49.5	I am about to bring terror on you” —a declaration of my Lord 
JER.49.6	Yet afterward I will restore Ammon’s children from exile.” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.7	About Edom, thus says 
JER.49.8	Flee! Turn back! Stay low, inhabitants of Dedan, for I will bring Esau’s calamity on him at the time that I punish him. 
JER.49.9	If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings? If thieves came at night, would they not destroy only enough for themselves? 
JER.49.10	But I will strip Esau bare. I will uncover his hiding places, so he will not be able to hide himself. His offspring has been destroyed with his kinsmen and neighbors. So he is nothing. 
JER.49.11	Leave your orphans— I will keep them alive, and let your widows trust in Me.” 
JER.49.12	For thus says 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by Myself” —it is a declaration of 
JER.49.14	I heard a message from 
JER.49.15	For see, I made you least among nations, despised among men. 
JER.49.16	Your terrorism has deceived you, so that your heart is arrogant. You who live in the clefts of the rock, who occupy the height of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as an eagle’s, I will bring you down from there.” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.17	“Edom will become a desolation. Everyone passing by will be appalled and hiss at all its plagues. 
JER.49.18	Like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah and their neighbors,” says 
JER.49.19	Look, it is like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to a secure pasture—for abruptly I will make him run away from it. I appoint over it whomever I choose. For who is like Me? Who will summon me to court? What shepherd stands up to Me?” 
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the plan that 
JER.49.21	The earth will tremble at the noise of their downfall. The sound of their outcry will be heard at the Sea of Reeds. 
JER.49.22	Behold, he will mount up and swoop down like an eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah. The hearts of Edom’s warriors in that day will be like a woman’s heart in her pangs. 
JER.49.23	About Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are ashamed, for they heard bad news, They melt away; in the sea there is trouble that cannot be quiet. 
JER.49.24	Damascus has become feeble. She turns away to flee, panic grips her, anguish and pangs have seized her, like a woman in travail. 
JER.49.25	How is the city of praise deserted— the city of my joy? 
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men will fall in her squares—all the warriors will be silenced in that day. It is a declaration of 
JER.49.27	“I will set fire to the wall of Damascus— it will devour Ben-hadad’s palaces.” 
JER.49.28	About Kedar and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says 
JER.49.29	They will take away their tents and their flocks. They will carry away their curtains, all their gear and their camels. They will cry out against them, ‘Terror on every side!’ 
JER.49.30	Flee! Scatter far! Stay low, inhabitants of Hazor!” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.31	Arise, go up against a nation at ease, dwelling securely,” says 
JER.49.32	Their camels will become plunder, their many cattle a spoil. I will scatter to all the winds those who shave the edges. I bring their calamity from every side.” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.33	“Hazor will be a lair of jackals, a desolation forever— no one will abide there, nor any son of man dwell there.” 
JER.49.34	The word of 
JER.49.35	thus says 
JER.49.36	I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them to all those winds. There will be no nation where the dispersed of Elam will not go. 
JER.49.37	I will shatter Elam before their enemies and before those seeking their soul. I will bring calamity on them— My burning anger!” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.38	Then I will put My throne in Elam and destroy from it king and princes.” It is a declaration of 
JER.49.39	“Yet it will be in the end of days, that I will restore Elam from exile.” It is a declaration of 
JER.50.1	The word that 
JER.50.2	“Declare it among the nations and proclaim! Raise a banner, announce, hide nothing! Say: ‘Babylon will be captured, Bel put to shame, Merodach dismayed, her images disgraced, her idols shattered!’ 
JER.50.3	For a nation comes up against her out of the land of the north —it will desolate her land. No one will dwell there— they have fled, gone, both man and beast.”
JER.50.4	“In those days and at that time” —it is a declaration of 
JER.50.5	They will ask about Zion, the way— here are their faces! Come! They will join themselves to 
JER.50.6	My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds led them astray. Turning around in the mountains, they went from mountain to hill, and forgot their resting place. 
JER.50.7	Everyone finding them devoured them. Their foes said: ‘We’re not guilty!’ Instead, they sinned against 
JER.50.8	“Flee from within Babylon, get out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like he-goats before the flock. 
JER.50.9	For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the north. They will form battle lines against her, from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like a warrior who bereaves, not returning empty. 
JER.50.10	Chaldea will be a spoil— all who plunder her will be satisfied.” It is a declaration of 
JER.50.11	“Because you rejoice, because you exult— you who plunder My inheritance— because you frolic like a trampling heifer and neigh like stallions, 
JER.50.12	your mother will be utterly ashamed, she who bore you will be humiliated. Behold, the least of the nations will be a wilderness, a dry land, a desert.” 
JER.50.13	Because of 
JER.50.14	Array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows— for she has sinned against 
JER.50.15	Raise a war cry against her all around! She has thrown up her hands, her bulwarks are fallen, her walls thrown down. For it is 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon and the one who wields a sickle in the time of harvest. Before the sword of the oppressor they will each turn to his people, each will flee to his own land. 
JER.50.17	Israel is a scattered flock— lions have driven them away. First, Assyria’s king devoured him. This last one who broke his bones was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. 
JER.50.18	Therefore thus says 
JER.50.19	I will bring Israel back to his pasture. He will feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. 
JER.50.20	In those days and in that time” —it is a declaration of 
JER.50.21	Go up against the land of Merathaim, against the inhabitants of Pekod. Put them to the sword and utterly destroy them” —it is a declaration of 
JER.50.22	The noise of battle is in the land and great crashing. 
JER.50.23	How the hammer of the whole earth has been cut down and smashed! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations! 
JER.50.24	I set a snare for you, so you were caught, O Babylon, when you were unaware. You were found and also caught, because you challenged 
JER.50.25	 has opened His armory and brought out the weapons of His indignation. For it is a work that my Lord 
JER.50.26	Come against her from afar, open her granaries, pile her up like heaps and utterly destroy her! Let nothing be left to her. 
JER.50.27	To the sword with all her bulls, going down to the slaughter! 
JER.50.28	The sound of fugitives, escaping out of the land of Babylon— declaring in Zion the vengeance of 
JER.50.29	Summon archers to Babylon, all who bend the bow. Encamp against her all around, let no one there escape. Repay her for her deed. As all she has done, do to her. For she was arrogant against 
JER.50.30	Therefore her young men will fall in her squares, all her warriors silenced in that day.” It is a declaration of 
JER.50.31	“Look, I am against you, arrogant one” —declares my Lord 
JER.50.32	The arrogant will stumble and fall, and no one will lift him up. I will kindle fire in his cities, and it will devour all who are round about him.” 
JER.50.33	Thus says 
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong —
JER.50.35	“A sword is on the Chaldeans” —it is a declaration of 
JER.50.36	A sword on the diviners—fools! A sword on her warriors—shattered! 
JER.50.37	A sword on their horses, their chariots, on all the mixed people within her, so they will become like women! A sword on her treasures— so they may be plundered. 
JER.50.38	A drought is on her waters, so they will be dried up. For it is a land of idols— they are mad about horrible things. 
JER.50.39	So wildcats and hyenas will live there and ostriches settle there. It will never again be inhabited or dwelt in from generation to generation. 
JER.50.40	As when Elohim overthrew Sodom, Gomorrah and their neighbor towns” —it is a declaration of 
JER.50.41	Look! A people coming from the north, a great nation and many kings will rise up from the ends of the earth. 
JER.50.42	They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel, with no compassion. Their voice roars like the sea, as they ride on horses, arranged as warriors for battle, against you, daughter of Babylon. 
JER.50.43	Babylon’s king heard news of them. His hands droop; anguish grabs him, agony like a woman in labor. 
JER.50.44	Look, it is like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to a secure pasture—for abruptly I will make him run away from it. I appoint over it whomever I choose. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me to court? What shepherd stands up to Me?” 
JER.50.45	Therefore hear the plan that 
JER.50.46	The earth will tremble at the noise of Babylon’s capture. The sound of their outcry will be heard among the nations. 
JER.51.1	Thus says 
JER.51.2	I will send strangers to Babylon to scatter her and empty her land. For in the day of trouble they will be against her all around. 
JER.51.3	Let the archer bend his bow at her. Let him rise up at her in his armor. Do not spare her young men. Destroy her whole army. 
JER.51.4	They will fall down slain in the land of Chaldea, thrust through in her streets. 
JER.51.5	For neither Israel nor Judah will be widowed by his God, 
JER.51.6	Flee from within Babylon! Each one, escape with his soul! Be not silenced in her iniquity! For it is a time of vengeance for 
JER.51.7	Babylon has been a golden cup in 
JER.51.8	Suddenly Babylon is fallen! Shattered! Howl over her! Bring balm for her wound. Perhaps she may be healed? 
JER.51.9	We would have healed Babylon, but she cannot be healed. Abandon her! Let’s go, each one to his own country, for her judgment has reached up to the heavens and has risen beyond the skies. 
JER.51.10	 has brought forth our vindication! Come, let us declare in Zion the work of 
JER.51.11	Sharpen the arrows. Fill the quivers! 
JER.51.12	Raise a banner at Babylon’s walls! Strengthen the guard. Station watchmen. Prepare ambushes. For 
JER.51.13	You dwelling by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness. 
JER.51.14	 has sworn by Himself: “Surely I will fill you with men like a locust swarm, and they will shout cheers over you.” 
JER.51.15	One made the earth by His power, set up the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His knowledge. 
JER.51.16	At His giving voice— tumult of waters in the skies! He causes clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings forth wind from His storehouses. 
JER.51.17	All mankind is stupid, ignorant. Every goldsmith is disgraced by an idol, for his molten image is a lie— there is no breath in them. 
JER.51.18	They are futile, a work of delusion. In the time of their visitation they will perish. 
JER.51.19	Jacob’s Portion is not like these, for He is the former of all things, including the tribe of His heritage —
JER.51.20	“You are My club, a war weapon— with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms. 
JER.51.21	With you I wreck horse and rider, with you I wreck chariot and rider, 
JER.51.22	with you I break man and woman, with you I break elder and youth, with you I break young man and maid, 
JER.51.23	with you I scatter shepherd and flock, with you I scatter plowman and ox-team, with you I scatter governors and officials. 
JER.51.24	I will repay Babylon and all living in Chaldea for all their evil that they did in Zion, before your eyes.” It is a declaration of 
JER.51.25	“Beware! I am against you, destroyer of the Mount!” —it is a declaration of 
JER.51.26	They will not even take from you a cornerstone or foundation stone, for you will be desolate forever.” It is a declaration of 
JER.51.27	Raise a banner in the land! Blow a 
JER.51.28	Consecrate the nations against her, the kings of the Medes, its governors and all its deputies, and all the land of his dominion. 
JER.51.29	Now the land shakes and writhes, for 
JER.51.30	Babylon’s warriors ceased fighting. They stay in their strongholds. Their might is exhausted. They have become like women. Her dwellings are set ablaze, her gate-bars are broken. 
JER.51.31	One runner runs to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell Babylon’s king that his city has been taken from end to end. 
JER.51.32	The fords have also been seized and the marshes burned with fire, so the warriors are in panic. 
JER.51.33	For thus says 
JER.51.34	“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me, crushed me, set me aside like an empty dish, swallowed me up like a dragon, filled his belly with my delicacies, rinsed me away.” 
JER.51.35	The one dwelling in Zion says: “Let the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon!” Jerusalem says: “My blood be on the Chaldeans!” 
JER.51.36	Therefore thus says 
JER.51.37	Babylon will become heaps, a dwelling for jackals, a horror and a hissing, uninhabited. 
JER.51.38	They roar together like young lions, growl like lions cubs. 
JER.51.39	When they become hot, I will set out a banquet for them and will make them so drunk that they become merry— and then sleep a perpetual sleep and never awake.” It is a declaration of 
JER.51.40	“I will drag them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats. 
JER.51.41	How has Sheshach been taken, the praise of the whole earth seized? How has Babylon become a horror among the nations! 
JER.51.42	The sea has risen over Babylon— she is covered with its roaring waves. 
JER.51.43	Her cities became desolation, a dry land, desert, uninhabited land, through which no son of man passes. 
JER.51.44	I will punish Bel in Babylon— What he swallowed I will make him disgorge out of his mouth. Nations will no longer stream to him. Yes, the wall of Babylon has fallen! 
JER.51.45	Come out of her, My people! Each of you, save your soul from the fierce anger of 
JER.51.46	Do not be faint-hearted, or be intimidated by the rumor heard in the land— one year one rumor comes, next year, another rumor. Yet violence will be in the land, with ruler against ruler. 
JER.51.47	Therefore behold, days are coming when I will punish Babylon’s idols. Her entire land will be disgraced and all her slain will fall in her midst. 
JER.51.48	Then heaven and the earth and all that is in them will sing for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers from the north will come to her.” It is a declaration of 
JER.51.49	Yes, Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel, even as the slain of all the earth fell to Babylon. 
JER.51.50	Escapees from the sword, go! Do not stand still! Remember 
JER.51.51	“We were shamed when we heard reproach. Disgrace has covered our faces, for foreigners entered the holy places of 
JER.51.52	“Therefore behold, days are coming” —it is a declaration of 
JER.51.53	Even if Babylon went up to heaven and even if she fortified the height of her stronghold, from Me destroyers will come to her.” It is a declaration of 
JER.51.54	The sound of an outcry from Babylon! Great ruin from the land of Chaldea! 
JER.51.55	For 
JER.51.56	For a destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon, and her warriors will be captured, their bows broken. For 
JER.51.57	“I will intoxicate her officials and sages, her governors, deputies, and warriors, and they will sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awake.” It is a declaration of the King, whose Name is 
JER.51.58	Thus says 
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was quartermaster. 
JER.51.60	And Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the evil that would come upon Babylon, including all these words that were written about Babylon. 
JER.51.61	Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you arrive in Babylon, then see that you read all these words, 
JER.51.62	and say: ‘
JER.51.63	“Now when you have finished reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates. 
JER.51.64	Then you will say: ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and not rise again, because of the calamity that I will bring on her. So they will weary themselves.’” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
JER.52.2	And he did what was evil in 
JER.52.3	Because of 
JER.52.4	It came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came—he and all his army—against Jerusalem, and besieged it. They built a siege wall all around it. 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
JER.52.6	In the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the famine was so severe in the city, that there was no food for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled, going out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was near the king’s garden—even though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They were heading along the way of the Arabah. 
JER.52.8	But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho. Then all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. He passed judgment on him. 
JER.52.10	At Riblah, the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and also all the Judean leaders. 
JER.52.11	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes. Then the king of Babylon bound him in bronze chains, and brought him to Babylon, where he put him in prison until the day of his death. 
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard came into Jerusalem to represent the king of Babylon. 
JER.52.13	Then he burned the House of 
JER.52.14	Then all the Chaldean army, which was with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and what remained of the craftsmen. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen. 
JER.52.17	The Chaldeans smashed the bronze pillars of the House of 
JER.52.18	The pots, the shovels, the wick trimmers, the basins, the pans, and all the bronze articles for Temple service, they also took away. 
JER.52.19	The cups, the fire-pans, the basins, the pots, the 
JER.52.20	As for the two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the stands that King Solomon had made for the House of 
JER.52.21	The height of one pillar was 18 cubits and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in its thickness—it was hollow. 
JER.52.22	There was a bronze capital on it—the height of one capital was five cubits, with latticework and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with pomegranates. 
JER.52.23	There were 96 pomegranates on the outside; including all the pomegranates around the lattice, there were 100. 
JER.52.24	Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the 
JER.52.25	From the city he took an officer who had been appointed over the men of war as well as seven men who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city, the scribe of the commander of the army, who enlisted people of the land, and 60 men of the people of the land who were found within the city. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
JER.52.27	The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Then Judah was led away into exile from its land. 
JER.52.28	These are the people whom Nebucha­dnez­zar carried away captive: in the seventh year 3,023 Jews; 
JER.52.29	in Nebuchadnez­zar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem; 
JER.52.30	in the Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard exiled 745 of the Jews—all together 4,600 people.
JER.52.31	Now it came to pass on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, that King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, and released him out of prison. 
JER.52.32	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	Then he changed out of his prison garments, dined regularly before him all the days of his life. 
JER.52.34	As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life. 
EZK.1.1	In the thirtieth year on the fifth day of the fourth month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens opened, and I saw visions of God. 
EZK.1.2	In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
EZK.1.3	the word of 
EZK.1.4	I looked, and behold, a storm wind came from the north, a great cloud with flashing fire and brightness all around it, and something like a glowing alloy out of the fire. 
EZK.1.5	From within it came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had a likeness of a human, 
EZK.1.6	but each one had four faces and each one of them had four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight and the soles of their feet were like the hoof of a calf. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had faces and wings: 
EZK.1.9	their wings touched one another; they did not turn when they moved; each could move in the direction of any of its faces. 
EZK.1.10	As for the form of their faces, each had a human face, the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side and the four had the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings touching the wing of another, while another two were covering their bodies. 
EZK.1.12	Now each being could move in the direction of any of its faces; wherever the 
EZK.1.13	As for the form of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, resembling torches moving between the living creatures. There was brightness to the fire, and lightning went forth from the fire. 
EZK.1.14	The living creatures were running back and forth like flashes of lightning. 
EZK.1.15	As I looked at the living creatures, behold, one wheel was on the ground next to each of the four-faced creatures. 
EZK.1.16	The appearance and structure of the wheels was like the gleaming of beryl. The four had the same likeness, their appearance and their structure seemed to be a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went in any of their four directions without pivoting as they went. 
EZK.1.18	Their rims were high and awesome—all four rims were full of eyes all around. 
EZK.1.19	When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the 
EZK.1.21	Whenever the creatures went, the wheels went. When the creatures stood still, these wheels stood still. When the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.22	Now over the heads of the living creatures there was something like an expanse, shining like the color of ice, stretched forth over their heads. 
EZK.1.23	Under the expanse, their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other. Each had another pair covering its body. 
EZK.1.24	When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of rushing waters, like the voice of Shaddai, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings. 
EZK.1.25	There came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings. 
EZK.1.26	Above the expanse over their heads was something like a throne, resembling a sapphire stone. Above the shape of the throne was a figure of human appearance. 
EZK.1.27	From what appeared as his waist upward, I saw a glowing metal, looking like a fire encased in a frame. From what was like his waist down, I saw the appearance of fire radiating around him. 
EZK.1.28	Like the appearance of the rainbow in the cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the radiance. It was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of 
EZK.2.1	Then He said to me: “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” 
EZK.2.2	As He spoke to me, the 
EZK.2.3	He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to 
EZK.2.4	The children have hard faces and stubborn hearts. I am sending you to them, and you are to tell them, ‘Thus says 
EZK.2.5	Whether they listen, or whether they will refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet was among them. 
EZK.2.6	“But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them. Do not fear their words, though thistles and thorns are beside you and you sit among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or be dismayed by their looks—for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.2.7	You will speak My words to them, whether they will listen or whether they will refuse to listen—for they are rebellious. 
EZK.2.8	Now you, son of man, hear what I say to you: do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat what I am giving to you.” 
EZK.2.9	I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched out to me, holding a written scroll. 
EZK.2.10	He spread it out before me. It was written on, front and back. Written on it were lamentations, dirges and woe.
EZK.3.1	Then He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find—eat this scroll. Then go, speak to the house of Israel.” 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat, 
EZK.3.3	as He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” I ate it and it tasted as sweet as honey. 
EZK.3.4	Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you are not sent to a people of unintelligible speech and difficult tongue, but to the house of Israel, 
EZK.3.6	nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult tongue, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. 
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel has a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. 
EZK.3.8	Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	I will make your forehead like adamant, harder than flint. Do not fear them. Do not be dismayed by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.” 
EZK.3.10	Furthermore, He said to me: “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all My words that I will speak to you. 
EZK.3.11	Go to the exiles, to the children of your people. Speak to them. Tell them, ‘Thus says 
EZK.3.12	Then the 
EZK.3.13	also the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, the sound of the wheels beside them and the sound of a great earthquake. 
EZK.3.14	The 
EZK.3.15	I came to the exiles at Tel-Abib who lived by the river Chebar. I sat where they were dwelling. I sat there overwhelmed among them for seven days. 
EZK.3.16	Now at the end of seven days, the word of 
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak to warn the wicked of his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked person will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood from your hand. 
EZK.3.19	Yet you, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. 
EZK.3.20	When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and acts perversely, I will lay a stumbling block before him and he will die. Because you have not warned him, he will die in his sin. His righteous deeds that he has done will not be remembered—but I will require his blood at your hand. 
EZK.3.21	If you warn the righteous person not to sin and the righteous person does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning. You will have delivered your soul.” 
EZK.3.22	The hand of 
EZK.3.23	So I arose, and went out to the valley. Behold, the glory of 
EZK.3.24	The 
EZK.3.25	You, son of man, behold, ropes will be put on you. You will be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people. 
EZK.3.26	I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth. You will be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth. You will say to them: ‘Thus says 
EZK.4.1	“Now you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you. Engrave on it a city, Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Lay siege against it, build earthworks against it, raise an assault ramp against it; pitch camps against it and place battering rams all around it. 
EZK.4.3	Then take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face toward it so that it is under siege. So you will lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.4	“Then you are to lie on your left side, and set on it the punishment of the house of Israel; according to the number of days that you lie on it, you will bear their iniquity. 
EZK.4.5	I have appointed the years of their punishment to you as a number of days—390 days. So you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.6	When you have completed these, you will lie on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah—40 days—a day for each year, I have appointed to you. 
EZK.4.7	You will set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	“Behold, I will put ropes upon you. You will not be able to turn from side to side until you have completed the days of your siege. 
EZK.4.9	Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and rye, and put them in one bowl. You will make bread from them for the number of days that you will lie on your side; for 390 days, you will eat it. 
EZK.4.10	The food that you will eat will be 20 shekels a day by weight. You may eat from it from time to time. 
EZK.4.11	You are also to drink water by measure, a sixth of a hin. You may drink it from time to time. 
EZK.4.12	Eat it as barley cakes. Bake it on human dung before their eyes.” 
EZK.4.13	Then 
EZK.4.14	Then I said, “Ah, 
EZK.4.15	He said to me, “See, I have given you cow dung instead of human dung. So you will prepare your bread on it.” 
EZK.4.16	Then he said to me, “Son of man, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, in anxiety, and they will drink water by measure, in horror. 
EZK.4.17	On account of their lack of bread and water they will be appalled at one another and waste away in their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	“Now you, son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair. 
EZK.5.2	A third you will burn in fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are complete. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. Scatter a third to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. 
EZK.5.3	Take a few from there and tie them up in your garment. 
EZK.5.4	Again take some of them, throw them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. A fire will spread from it into all the house of Israel.” 
EZK.5.5	Thus says 
EZK.5.6	She has rebelled against My ordinances by doing wickedness worse than the nations, and against My decrees worse than the surrounding countries. For they have rejected My ordinances and as for My decrees, they have not walked in them.” 
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus says 
EZK.5.8	therefore thus says 
EZK.5.9	On account of your abominations I will do with you that which I have never done, and the like of which I would never do again.
EZK.5.10	Therefore the fathers will eat the sons in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you and I will scatter the remainder of you to all the winds. 
EZK.5.11	“Therefore, as I live, says 
EZK.5.12	A third of you will die with the plague and will be consumed with famine in your midst. A third will fall by the sword all around you. A third I will scatter to all the winds, and draw out a sword after them. 
EZK.5.13	I will vent all My anger and satisfy My fury on them. Then I will rest. So they will know that I, 
EZK.5.14	“Moreover I will make you a ruin and a mockery among the surrounding nations and in the sight of all who pass by. 
EZK.5.15	When I execute judgment upon you in anger, rage and furious chastisement, you will be a mockery and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the surrounding nations: I, 
EZK.5.16	When I send evil arrows of famine upon them, for destruction I will send them to destroy you, and I will intensify the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread. 
EZK.5.17	I will send on you famine and evil beasts, and they will make you childless. Plague and blood will sweep through you. I will bring the sword upon you. I, 
EZK.6.1	The word of 
EZK.6.2	“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy to them. 
EZK.6.3	Say: mountains of Israel, hear the word of 
EZK.6.4	Your altars will become desolate. Your sun pillars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols. 
EZK.6.5	I will lay the corpses of 
EZK.6.6	In all your dwellings the cities will be desolate. The high places will be deserted. Your altars will be laid waste and made desolate, your idols broken and destroyed, your sun pillars cut down and your works blotted out. 
EZK.6.7	The slain will fall in your midst. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.6.8	“Yet I will leave a remnant, some that escape the sword among the nations, when you have been scattered through the countries. 
EZK.6.9	The survivors will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I was crushed by their adulterous heart that has strayed from Me and their eyes which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils that they committed in all their abominations. 
EZK.6.10	They will know that I am 
EZK.6.11	Thus says 
EZK.6.12	The one who is far off will die of the plague; the one who is near will fall by the sword. Whoever remains and is spared will die by the famine; this is how I will spend My fury on them. 
EZK.6.13	You will know that I am 
EZK.6.14	I will stretch out My hand over them and make the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness of Diblah, wherever they live. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.7.1	The word of 
EZK.7.2	“You, son of man, thus says 
EZK.7.3	The end is upon you. I will send My anger on you. I will judge you according to your ways. I will bring all your abominations on you. 
EZK.7.4	My eyes will not spare you nor will I have pity, but I will bring your ways upon you, for your abominations in your midst. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.7.5	Thus says 
EZK.7.6	An end has come, the end has come! It has awakened against you. Look, it is coming! 
EZK.7.7	Doom has come upon you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come, the day is near—panic, not joyful shouting on the hills. 
EZK.7.8	Now, soon, I am about to pour out My fury on you. I will exhaust My anger on you. I will judge you according to your ways. I will bring all your abominations on you. 
EZK.7.9	My eye will not spare you nor will I have pity—I will repay you for your ways—your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that it is I, 
EZK.7.10	Behold, the day! Look, it is coming! Doom has gone out. The rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed. 
EZK.7.11	Violence grows into a rod of wickedness. Nothing will come from them, nothing from their crowd, nothing from their tumult, nothing distinctive among them. 
EZK.7.12	The time has come—the day draws near. The buyer will not rejoice, the seller will not play the mourner, for wrath is on the entire crowd. 
EZK.7.13	For a seller will not regain what he sold, as long as they are alive. For the vision against her whole crowd will not be revoked. No one will preserve his life, because of his iniquity. 
EZK.7.14	“They have blown the horn. They have made everyone ready. Yet no one goes to the battle. Surely My wrath is on her whole crowd. 
EZK.7.15	Outside is the sword, inside plague and famine. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword. Whoever is in the city will be devoured by famine and plague. 
EZK.7.16	Those survivors who escape will head for the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity. 
EZK.7.17	All hands will be feeble. All knees will turn to water. 
EZK.7.18	They will also gird on sackcloth. Horror will cover them. Shame will be upon all faces. Baldness will be upon all their heads. 
EZK.7.19	They will throw their silver in the streets. Their gold will be as garbage. Their silver and their gold cannot deliver them in the day of 
EZK.7.20	They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and made images of their abominations and their detestable idols. Therefore I made it 
EZK.7.21	I will give it into the hands of the strangers as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it. 
EZK.7.22	I will turn My face from them, as they will profane the place I treasure. Robbers will enter it and profane it. 
EZK.7.23	“Forge the chain! For the land is full of bloodshed. The city is full of violence. 
EZK.7.24	I will bring the wicked of the nations. They will possess their houses. So I will end the pride of the strong, when their holy places are profaned. 
EZK.7.25	Shuddering comes. They will seek peace but there will be none. 
EZK.7.26	Disaster upon disaster will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will seek a vision from a prophet, but 
EZK.7.27	The king will mourn. The prince will be clothed with despair. The hands of the people of the land will tremble. By their conduct I will deal with them. By their own standards I will judge them. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.8.1	In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting in my house. The elders of Judah were sitting before me. There the hand of 
EZK.8.2	I looked, and behold, a form resembling fire—from the appearance of his waist downward, fire; and from his loins and waist upward, something like the appearance of brightness, as glowing metal. 
EZK.8.3	Something like the form of a hand stretched out, and took me by the hair of my head. The 
EZK.8.4	Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley. 
EZK.8.5	He said to me: “Son of man, lift your eyes toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north. Behold, north of the gate of the altar, was this image provoking jealousy in the entrance. 
EZK.8.6	He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, that drives me far off from My own Sanctuary? But you will see even greater abominations.” 
EZK.8.7	He brought me to the door of the court. When I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	Then He said to me, “Son of man, now dig through the wall.” When I had dug through the wall, there was a door. 
EZK.8.9	He said to me: “Go and see the wicked abominations that they do here.” 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw, behold, every detestable image of creeping things and beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraved on the surrounding walls. 
EZK.8.11	Standing there before them were 70 men of the elders of the house of Israel, Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in their midst, each man with his censer in his hand. A thick cloud of incense went up. 
EZK.8.12	Then He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chamber of his carved idol? For they say, ‘
EZK.8.13	He said further to me, “You will see still greater abominations that they are doing.” 
EZK.8.14	He brought me to the door of the gate of 
EZK.8.15	He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see even greater abominations than these.” 
EZK.8.16	So He brought me into the inner court of 
EZK.8.17	He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it too light a thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations they practice here, that they must also fill the land with violence and provoke Me still more? Look, they are putting the twig to My nose! 
EZK.8.18	Therefore I will indeed act in fury. My eye will not spare you nor will I have pity. Though they cry into My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
EZK.9.1	Then He called into my ears in a loud voice saying: “Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	Behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, facing north, each with his war club in his hand. One man among them, clothed in linen, had a scribe’s writing case at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar. 
EZK.9.3	Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cheruv, where it had been, to the threshold of the House. He called to the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe’s inkhorn at his side. 
EZK.9.4	 said to him, “Go throughout the city, through the midst of Jerusalem. Make a mark on the foreheads of the people who sigh and moan over all the abominations that are committed in it.” 
EZK.9.5	To the others He said in my hearing: “Go through the city after him and strike. Show no pity or compassion; 
EZK.9.6	kill off old men, young men and girls, little children and women. But touch no one who has the mark. Begin at My Sanctuary.” Then they began with the elders who were before the House. 
EZK.9.7	He said to them, “Defile the House and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” So they went out and began to kill in the city. 
EZK.9.8	While they were out killing, and I was left alone, I fell on my face and cried out saying, “Alas, 
EZK.9.9	He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great; the land is full of blood and the city is full of corruption. For they say, ‘
EZK.9.10	As for Me, my eye will not show pity nor will I spare. I will bring their conduct upon their head.” 
EZK.9.11	Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported saying, “I have done just as You have commanded me.”
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and behold, above the expanse over the heads of the 
EZK.10.2	He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels underneath the 
EZK.10.3	Now the 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of 
EZK.10.5	The sound of the wings of the 
EZK.10.6	After He commanded the man clothed in linen saying: “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the

EZK.10.9	Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the 
EZK.10.10	As for their appearance, the four had one form—like a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they would go in any of their four directions, without pivoting as they went. So to whatever place the head faced, they followed, without turning as they went. 
EZK.10.12	Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and their wheels, the wheels of the four of them, were full of eyes all around. 
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing “the whirling wheels.” 
EZK.10.14	Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cheruv, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
EZK.10.15	The 
EZK.10.16	As the 
EZK.10.17	When they stood still, these stood still. When they rose up, these rose up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them. 
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of 
EZK.10.19	The 
EZK.10.20	They were the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar. I knew that they were 
EZK.10.21	Each of them had four faces and each one four wings. The appearance of human hands was under their wings. 
EZK.10.22	As for the appearance of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I saw by the river Chebar. Each could move in the direction of any of its faces.
EZK.11.1	Then the 
EZK.11.2	He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men that devise sin and give wicked counsel in this city, 
EZK.11.3	who say, ‘This is not the time to build houses! This city is the cooking pot and we are the meat!’ 
EZK.11.4	Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.” 
EZK.11.5	Then the 
EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city and you filled the streets with corpses.” 
EZK.11.7	Therefore, thus says 
EZK.11.8	You feared the sword, so I will bring the sword against you.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.11.9	“I will bring you out of the midst of it, give you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you. 
EZK.11.10	You will fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel. So you will know that I am 
EZK.11.11	This city will not be your cooking pot nor will you be the meat in the midst of it—I will judge you at Israel’s border. 
EZK.11.12	So you will know that I am 
EZK.11.13	As I prophesied, Pelatiah son of Benaiah dropped dead. I fell upon my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, “Ah, 
EZK.11.14	The word of 
EZK.11.15	“Son of man, as for your kinsmen, your kinsmen, fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel—all of them—are those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, ‘Keep far away from 
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, thus says 
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, thus says 
EZK.11.18	When they come there, they will remove all of its detestable things and all of its abominations. 
EZK.11.19	Then I will give them one heart. I will put a new Spirit within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, 
EZK.11.20	so that they may follow My laws, keep My ordinances and practice them. They will be My people and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	As for those whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their ways upon their heads.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.11.22	Then the 
EZK.11.23	The glory of 
EZK.11.24	The 
EZK.11.25	So I told the exiles all the things that 
EZK.12.1	The word of 
EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house. They have eyes to see, but do not see, ears to hear, but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.3	You, son of man, prepare supplies for exile. Go into exile by day in their sight, go away as if into exile from your home to another place in their sight—perhaps they will recognize that they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.4	You will bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. You will go out at evening in their sight, like those going into exile. 
EZK.12.5	As they watch, dig through the wall and go out through it. 
EZK.12.6	Bear the burden on your shoulder in their sight. Carry it out in the darkness; cover your face so that you cannot see the ground. For I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.” 
EZK.12.7	I did just as I was commanded: I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile. In the evening, I dug through the wall with my hand. I carried it out in the darkness and bore it on my shoulder, as they watched. 
EZK.12.8	In the morning, the word of 
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, has the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘Thus says 
EZK.12.11	Say, ‘I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them—they will go into exile, into captivity. 
EZK.12.12	The prince who is among them will bear a burden on his shoulder, and go out in the darkness. They will dig through the wall to get out; he will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes. 
EZK.12.13	I will spread out My net upon him, so he will be caught in My net. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans. He will not see it, though he will die there. 
EZK.12.14	I will disperse toward every wind all that surround him to help him and all his troops. I will draw out the sword after them. 
EZK.12.15	So they will know that I am 
EZK.12.16	But I will let a few of them escape the sword, the famine and the pestilence, so they may tell about all their detestable practices among the nations where they go. And they will know that I am 
EZK.12.17	The word of 
EZK.12.18	“Son of man, eat your bread with quaking and drink your water with trembling and anxiety. 
EZK.12.19	Say to the people of the land, this is what 
EZK.12.20	The inhabited cities will be deserted and the land will become desolate. And you will know that I am 
EZK.12.21	The word of 
EZK.12.22	“Son of man, what is that proverb you people have in the land of Israel saying, ‘The days are prolonged and every vision fails?’ 
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, thus says 
EZK.12.24	For no longer will every vision be deceitful and every oracle false in the house of Israel. 
EZK.12.25	For I am 
EZK.12.26	The word of 
EZK.12.27	“Son of man, behold, the house of Israel says, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days from now. He prophesies about times that are far off.’ 
EZK.12.28	Therefore say to them, thus says 
EZK.13.1	The word of 
EZK.13.2	“Son of man, prophesy concerning the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, hear the word of 
EZK.13.3	thus says 
EZK.13.4	O Israel, your prophets have been like jackals among ruins. 
EZK.13.5	You have not gone up into the breaches and repaired the walls for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of 
EZK.13.6	They have prophesied emptiness and predicted falsely, who say, “
EZK.13.7	Did you not see an empty vision and speak a false omen, when you say, “
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus says 
EZK.13.9	“My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not remain in the assembly of My people, nor will they be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, nor enter into the land of Israel. You will know that I am 
EZK.13.10	Precisely because they have led My people astray saying, ‘
EZK.13.11	Say to those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. There will be a down-pouring rain, and on you great hailstones will fall, and a storm wind will break out. 
EZK.13.12	Behold, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said about you, ‘Where is the whitewash that you plastered it with?’’’ 
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus says 
EZK.13.14	I will tear down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation of it is exposed. It will collapse and you will be consumed within it. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.13.15	I will spend My wrath against the wall and against those who plastered it with whitewash. I will say to you, the wall is no more! The whitewashers are no more—
EZK.13.16	the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem and see visions of 
EZK.13.17	“Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them 
EZK.13.18	saying, thus says 
EZK.13.19	You have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and crumbs of bread, to kill those who should not die and to save those who should not live, by lying to My people, who listen to lies.’” 
EZK.13.20	Therefore thus says 
EZK.13.21	I will tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands. They will never again be in your hand to be hunted. So you will know that I am 
EZK.13.22	Because you have discouraged the hearts of the righteous with your lies, when I have not grieved him; and strengthened the hands of the wicked so he may not return from his wicked way and live, 
EZK.13.23	therefore you will no longer see false visions or utter lying divinations again. I will deliver My people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.14.1	Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. 
EZK.14.2	The word of 
EZK.14.3	“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts. They have put the stumbling block of their iniquity right before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all? 
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak to them, and say to them, thus says 
EZK.14.5	so I may take hold of the house of Israel in their hearts. For they have all become estranged from Me through their idols.’” 
EZK.14.6	Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus says 
EZK.14.7	For anyone from the house of Israel or the outsiders who dwell in Israel who breaks himself away from Me takes idols into his heart, puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me through him—I, 
EZK.14.8	I will set My face against that man. I will make him a sign and a proverb and cut him off from among My people. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.14.9	“When the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, 
EZK.14.10	They will bear their punishment—the punishment of the prophet will be the same as the punishment of the inquirer—
EZK.14.11	so that the house of Israel will not wander again from Me or defile themselves again with all their transgressions. They will be My people and I will be their God.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.14.12	The word of 
EZK.14.13	“Son of man, suppose a land sins against Me by trespassing grievously and I stretch out My hand over it, break off its staff of bread, send famine upon it and cut it off from man and beast. 
EZK.14.14	Even if these three men—Noah, Daniel and Job—be in it, they would only deliver their own souls by their righteousness.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.14.15	“If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land and they ravage it and make it a wasteland, so that no one would pass through because of the beasts, 
EZK.14.16	even if these three men were in it, as I live, says 
EZK.14.17	Or if I bring a sword on that land and say: ‘Let the sword go through the land,’ so that I cut off man and beast from it; 
EZK.14.18	though these three men were in it, as I live, says 
EZK.14.19	“Or, suppose I were to send a plague to that land and pour out My fury upon it in blood, to cut off man and beast from it. 
EZK.14.20	Even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, as I live, says 
EZK.14.21	For thus 
EZK.14.22	Yet behold, survivors would remain in it who would be brought out, both sons and daughters. Behold, when they come to you and you see their ways and their deeds, you would be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought against Jerusalem, all that I have brought on it. 
EZK.14.23	They would comfort you when you see their ways and their deeds. So you will know that I had not done all that I had done without cause.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.15.1	The word of 
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, how can the wood of a vine be better than the branch of any tree that is among the trees of the forest? 
EZK.15.3	Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Can a peg be made from it to hang anything on? 
EZK.15.4	Behold, when it is cast in the fire for fuel, both ends are devoured in fire and the middle is charred—is it useful for any work? 
EZK.15.5	Look, when it was whole, it was not useful for any work—how much less, when the fire has devoured it and it is charred, will it be useful for any work? 
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus says 
EZK.15.7	I will set My face against them. Even if they come out of the fire, the fire will yet devour them. So you will know that I am 
EZK.15.8	I will make the land desolate, because they have acted so faithlessly.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.16.1	The word of 
EZK.16.2	“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her abominations 
EZK.16.3	and say, thus says 
EZK.16.4	As for your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut nor were you washed in water for cleansing. You were never rubbed with salt nor were you swaddled at all. 
EZK.16.5	No eye pitied you enough to do any of these things to you out of compassion. Instead you were cast out in the open field, for you were detested on the day you were born. 
EZK.16.6	“When I passed by you, and saw you kicking in your blood. I said to you, ‘In your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘In your blood, live!’ 
EZK.16.7	I made you grow as myriads, like a branch of the field. You grew up, got tall and came to full adornment. Your breasts were formed, your hair sprouted. Yet you were naked and bare. 
EZK.16.8	“Again I passed by and saw you, and behold, you were truly at the time of love. I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I swore to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says 
EZK.16.9	Then I washed you with water, rinsed off your blood from on you and anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed you with embroidery and put sandals of fine leather on you. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk. 
EZK.16.11	I adorned you with jewelry, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace on your neck. 
EZK.16.12	I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears and a crown of glory on your head. 
EZK.16.13	So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your raiment was of fine linen, silk and embroidery. You ate fine flour, honey and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful, and advanced to the kingdom. 
EZK.16.14	Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect, through My splendor, which I bestowed on you.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.16.15	“But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a harlot. You poured out your enticements on everyone who passed by—they were his. 
EZK.16.16	You took your garments, made high places decked out with various colors and fornicated on them—this should not happen, it should not be! 
EZK.16.17	You also took your jewelry—My gold and My silver, which I gave you—made male images for yourself and committed harlotry with them. 
EZK.16.18	You took your embroidered garments, covered them and placed My oil and My incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	My bread that I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey that I fed you with, you set before them as a sweet aroma. That is what happened.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.16.20	“You took your sons and your daughters whom you bore for Me, and sacrificed them to be eaten by them. Were your obscene practices not enough? 
EZK.16.21	You slaughtered My children, making them pass through fire for them. 
EZK.16.22	In all your abominations and harlotry, you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. 
EZK.16.23	So it was after all your wickedness—oy, oy to you!” It is a declaration of 
EZK.16.24	“Then you built a mound for yourself. You made a high place for yourself in every square. 
EZK.16.25	You built your lofty place at the head of every street. You made your beauty an abomination. You spread your legs for everyone passing by and multiplied your harlotry. 
EZK.16.26	You committed immorality with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors. You multiplied your prostitution, to provoke Me. 
EZK.16.27	“So behold, I stretched out My hand over you. I diminished your ration. I gave you over to those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your indecent conduct. 
EZK.16.28	Then you also played the harlot with the Assyrians, never being satisfied; you played the harlot with them, and still you were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	So you multiplied your harlotry toward the land of merchants—Chaldea—yet even with this, you were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.30	“How weak is your heart”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.16.31	when you build your mound at the head of every road and make your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, since you scoffed at receiving payment. 
EZK.16.32	You adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! 
EZK.16.33	To all prostitutes gifts are given—but you gave your gifts to all your lovers! You bribed them to come to you from every side in your harlotry. 
EZK.16.34	So you are the opposite of other women—no one runs after you for favors. You give payment and none is given to you. So you are the opposite! 
EZK.16.35	“Therefore, harlot, hear the word of 
EZK.16.36	Thus says 
EZK.16.37	therefore behold, I will gather all your lovers—those you have pleased and all those you have loved, with all them that you have hated. I will gather them against you from every side. I will expose your nakedness to them, so they may all see your nakedness. 
EZK.16.38	So I will judge you, as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged. Then I will bring on you the blood of fury and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	I will give you into their hand. They will tear down your mound and break down your high places. They will strip you of your clothes and take your jewelry. They will leave you naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They will also incite an assembly against you, stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will set your houses on fire and execute judgment on you in the sight of many women. So I will cause you to stop your harlotry. You will never again pay for a lover. 
EZK.16.42	So I will calm My fury against you and My jealousy will turn away from you. Then I will be quiet and angry no longer. 
EZK.16.43	“Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but have enraged Me in all these things, behold, I will also bring your way on your head”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.16.44	Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will say this proverb against you, saying, ‘As the mother, so her daughter.’ 
EZK.16.45	You are your mother’s daughter, who despises her husband and her children. You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite. Your father was an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	Your elder sister who lives to your left is Samaria, she and her daughters. Your younger sister who lives to your right is Sodom, with her daughters. 
EZK.16.47	You have not only walked in their ways and gone after their abominations, but in a very short time, you have acted more corruptly than them in all your ways.” 
EZK.16.48	“As I live”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, gluttony, and careless ease—so had she and her daughters—and she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	So they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it. 
EZK.16.51	Moreover, Samaria did not commit even half of your sins. You multiplied your abominations beyond theirs. So you made your sisters seem righteous by all your disgusting things you have done. 
EZK.16.52	You also bear your own shame, since you have interceded for your sisters. Because of your sins that you committed, more treacherous than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So you also, be ashamed! Bear your disgrace, since you have justified your sisters. 
EZK.16.53	“I will return their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them, your own captivity. 
EZK.16.54	So you will bear your own disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done in becoming a consolation to them. 
EZK.16.55	Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, Samaria and her daughters, will return to their former state. You and your daughters will return to your former state. 
EZK.16.56	“Was not your sister Sodom an object of scorn to you in the day of your pride, 
EZK.16.57	before your own wickedness was exposed? Now you have become an object of scorn for the daughters of Aram and all that surround her, for the daughters of the Philistines, for all around who despise you. 
EZK.16.58	You will bear your wickedness and your abominations.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.16.59	For thus says 
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth. Moreover, I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and younger sisters. I will give them to you for daughters, yet not because of your covenant. 
EZK.16.62	So I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know that I am 
EZK.16.63	So you will remember, be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your disgrace, when I have forgiven you of all that you have done.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.17.1	The word of 
EZK.17.2	“Son of man, propose a riddle and tell a parable to the house of Israel.” 
EZK.17.3	Say, thus says 
EZK.17.4	He plucked off its topmost twigs, carried them to the land of trade and set it in a city of merchants. 
EZK.17.5	Then he took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig. 
EZK.17.6	Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine, with its branches turned toward him, but its roots grew under him. So it became a vine, produced branches and sent out shoots. 
EZK.17.7	“There was also another great eagle with large wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, so that he might water it. 
EZK.17.8	It was planted in good soil by much water, so it would bring forth branches, bear fruit and be a glorious vine.” 
EZK.17.9	Say, thus says 
EZK.17.10	Behold, though planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither when the east wind strikes it? In the beds where it grew it will wither.” 
EZK.17.11	Then the word of 
EZK.17.12	Say now to the rebellious house, “Do you not know what these things mean?” Tell them: “Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took the king and the princes and brought them with him to Babylon. 
EZK.17.13	He took one of the royal offspring, cut a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the leading men of the land, 
EZK.17.14	so the kingdom might be lowly, not exalting itself, but keeping his covenant so it would hold up. 
EZK.17.15	“However, he rebelled against him in sending his messengers into Egypt, so they might give him horses and many people. Will he succeed? Will one doing such things escape? Will he break a covenant and escape? 
EZK.17.16	As I live”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and great throng will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are cast up and siege towers erected, to cut off many lives. 
EZK.17.18	“Since he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he had given his hand yet did all these things, he will not escape. 
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus says 
EZK.17.20	I will spread My net over him and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon, and judge him there for his treachery that he committed against Me. 
EZK.17.21	All the fugitives of all his armies will fall by the sword. Those that remain will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I, 
EZK.17.22	Thus says 
EZK.17.23	I will plant it on Israel’s high mountain. It will bring forth branches, bear fruit and be a magnificent cedar. Birds of every kind will nest under it—they will nest in the shade of its branches. 
EZK.17.24	Then all the trees of the field will know that I, 
EZK.18.1	The word of 
EZK.18.2	“What do you mean by using this proverb in the land of Israel saying, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, so the children’s teeth are set on edge?’ 
EZK.18.3	As I live”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.18.4	Behold, every living soul is Mine—the soul of father as well as the soul of son—both are Mine. Behold, the soul who sins is the one who will die. 
EZK.18.5	“Suppose a man is just and does what is lawful and right: 
EZK.18.6	He has not eaten at mountain shrines or lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel. He has not defiled his neighbor’s wife or come near to a woman during 
EZK.18.7	He does not wrong anyone, returns his pledge for a debt, does not commit robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment. 
EZK.18.8	He does not loan with interest or take unjust gain. He keeps his hand from iniquity, executes true justice between people, 
EZK.18.9	walks in My laws and keeps My statutes, behaving honestly. Such a person is just—he will surely live.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.18.10	“Now suppose he fathers a son who is violent, who sheds blood and does any of these things to a brother 
EZK.18.11	(though the father himself does none of these things). He has even eaten at mountain shrines, defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
EZK.18.12	wronged the poor and needy, taken by robbery, not restored the pledge, lifted up his eyes to the idols, committed abomination, 
EZK.18.13	loaned with interest and taken unjust gain. Will he then live? He will not live! He has done all these detestable things. He will surely be put to death and his blood will be on him. 
EZK.18.14	“Now behold, suppose he fathers a son who sees all his father’s sins that he committed, and observing, does not do likewise. 
EZK.18.15	He does not eat at mountain shrines, or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor’s wife, 
EZK.18.16	nor does he wrong anyone, take pledged property or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, 
EZK.18.17	withholds his hand from mistreating the poor, does not take interest or increase, practices My laws and walks in My statutes—he will not die for the iniquity of his father, he will surely live. 
EZK.18.18	“As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, committed robbery from his brother and did what is not good among his people—behold, he will die for his iniquity. 
EZK.18.19	Yet you say, ‘Why does the son not bear the iniquity of the father with him?’ When the son has done what is lawful and right, has kept all My statutes and has done them, he will surely live. 
EZK.18.20	The soul that sins, he will die. The son will not bear the iniquity of the father with him, nor will the father bear the iniquity of the son with him. The righteousness of the righteous will be on him and the wickedness of the wicked will be on him. 
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. 
EZK.18.22	None of his transgressions that he committed will be remembered; because of his righteousness that he practiced, he will live. 
EZK.18.23	“Do I delight at all in the death of the wicked?” It is a declaration of 
EZK.18.24	But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity and does according to all the detestable acts that the wicked man does, will he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done will be remembered; for his trespass that he trespassed and for his sin that he has sinned, for them he will die. 
EZK.18.25	“Yet you say, ‘
EZK.18.26	When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die for it; because of his iniquity that he did, he will die. 
EZK.18.27	But when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he committed and does what is lawful and right, his soul will live. 
EZK.18.28	Because he considers and turns away from all his transgressions that he committed, he will surely live, not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of 
EZK.18.30	“Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, each one according to his ways.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.18.31	Cast off from you all your transgressions that you have committed. Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, house of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.19.1	“As for you, raise a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
EZK.19.2	and say: ‘What was your mother? A lioness! Among lions she couched, among young lions she reared her cubs. 
EZK.19.3	When she raised up one of her cubs, he became a young lion. When he learned to tear prey, he devoured people. 
EZK.19.4	When the nations heard about him, he was caught in their pit. They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. 
EZK.19.5	When she saw that she waited in vain, her hope was lost. So she took another cub and made him a young lion. 
EZK.19.6	He prowled among the lions. He became a young lion, learned to catch prey, devoured men. 
EZK.19.7	He ravaged their widows and laid waste their cities. The land and all who were in it were terrified from his roaring. 
EZK.19.8	The nations gathered against him on every side from the provinces. They spread their net over him. He was caught in their pit. 
EZK.19.9	They put him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him in hunting nets. So his roar was no longer heard on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.19.10	“Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the water. It was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water. 
EZK.19.11	Its strong rods became rulers’ scepters. Its height was exalted above the clouds. It was seen in its height with the mass of its branches. 
EZK.19.12	But it was uprooted in fury. It was cast down to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were broken off and dried up—fire consumed it. 
EZK.19.13	Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. 
EZK.19.14	Fire has spread from its main branch and devoured its fruit. No strong branch is left on it to become a ruler’s scepter.” This is a lamentation, and it is to be used as a lamentation. 
EZK.20.1	On the tenth day of the fifth month of the seventh year, some of the elders of Israel came to seek 
EZK.20.2	The word of 
EZK.20.3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel. Say to them, thus says 
EZK.20.4	“Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Make them know the detestable practices of their fathers. 
EZK.20.5	Say to them, thus says 
EZK.20.6	On that day I lifted up My hand to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had sought out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the splendor of all lands. 
EZK.20.7	I said to them, ‘Each of you must throw away every detestable thing from his eyes, and not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am 
EZK.20.8	“But they rebelled against Me and were unwilling to listen to Me. None of them cast away the detestable things that were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour out My fury upon them, to expend My anger upon them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I acted, for the sake of My Name, to keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations, where they were, in whose sight I made Myself known to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.10	So I led them out from the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	I gave them My laws and taught them My judgments, which if a man does, he will live by them. 
EZK.20.12	I also gave them My 
EZK.20.13	“But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes. They rejected My judgments, which if a man does, he will live by them. They greatly profaned My 
EZK.20.14	But for the sake of My Name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	Yet I also lifted My hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the splendor of all lands. 
EZK.20.16	For they rejected My laws, did not walk in My rulings and profaned My 
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless, My eye spared them from destruction, so I did not make a full end of them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.18	“I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, do not keep their ordinances, do not defile yourselves with their idols. 
EZK.20.19	I am 
EZK.20.20	Keep My 
EZK.20.21	“But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes. They did not keep My ordinances to do them, which if a man does, he will live by them; they profaned My 
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless, I withheld My hand. For the sake of My Name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.23	I also lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, to scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries. 
EZK.20.24	For they had not obeyed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and profaned My 
EZK.20.25	I also gave them statutes that were not good, ordinances by which they could not live. 
EZK.20.26	I let them become polluted in their own gifts, when they offered up all that opened the womb to pass through the fire, so that I might make them desolate, so that they would know that I am 
EZK.20.27	“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, thus says 
EZK.20.28	When I brought them into the land, which I lifted up My hand to give to them, they saw every high hill and every leafy tree. There they slaughtered their sacrifices and presented their offensive offering. There they made their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings. 
EZK.20.29	So I asked them, ‘What is the high place where you are going?’ So the name of it is called Bamah to this day. 
EZK.20.30	Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus says 
EZK.20.31	When offering your gifts, making your sons pass through the fire, you keep polluting yourselves with all your idols, up to this day. So should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.20.32	What comes up in your mind will not happen at all, when you say, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the families of the countries, worshiping wood and stone.’ 
EZK.20.33	As I live,”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.20.34	I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm, with fury poured out. 
EZK.20.35	I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples. I will judge you there face to face. 
EZK.20.36	Just as I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.20.37	“I will make you pass under the rod and bring you into the bond of the covenant. 
EZK.20.38	I will purge out the rebels from among you and those who transgress against Me. I will bring them out from the land where they dwell, but they will not enter the land of Israel. So you will know that I am 
EZK.20.39	“As for you, house of Israel,” thus says 
EZK.20.40	For in My holy mountain, Israel’s high mountain”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.20.41	With your sweet aroma I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered. I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. 
EZK.20.42	You will know that I am 
EZK.20.43	There you will remember your ways and all your deeds, by which you defiled yourselves. You will loathe yourselves for all your evil that you have done. 
EZK.20.44	Then you will know that I am 
EZK.21.1	The word of 
EZK.21.2	“Son of man, set your face toward Teman and proclaim to the South. Prophesy against the brush land of the Negev. 
EZK.21.3	Say to the brush land of the South: ‘Hear the word of 
EZK.21.4	All flesh will see that I, 
EZK.21.5	Then I said, “Ah, 
EZK.21.6	Then the word of 
EZK.21.7	“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and proclaim to the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel. 
EZK.21.8	Say to the land of Israel, thus says 
EZK.21.9	Since I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will come out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north. 
EZK.21.10	All flesh will know that I, 
EZK.21.11	As for you, son of man, groan, with breaking of your sides and with bitterness you will groan before their eyes. 
EZK.21.12	Now when they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you will say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, every hand will be limp, every spirit will be faint, and all knees will turn to water. Behold, it is coming, and it will happen!’” It is a declaration of 
EZK.21.13	The word of 
EZK.21.14	“Son of man, prophesy and say, thus says 
EZK.21.15	Sharpened to slaughter ruthlessly! Polished so it will flash like lightning! Or should we rejoice? It is the rod, My son—despising every tree! 
EZK.21.16	It is given to be polished, to be seized. The sword is sharpened, polished, to be put into the hand of the slayer. 
EZK.21.17	Cry and wail, son of man! For it is against My people. It is against all the leaders of Israel. They are thrown over to the sword, along with My people. Therefore strike your thigh. 
EZK.21.18	For it is a testing. What if they scorn even the rod? It must not be!” It is a declaration of 
EZK.21.19	You, son of man, prophesy. Strike your hands together. The sword will strike twice, even three times, a sword for the slain, a sword for a great slaughter—it surrounds them! 
EZK.21.20	So that their hearts will melt and many will stumble and fall, I have set the point of the sword against all their gates. Alas! It is made for lightning, it is polished for slaughter. 
EZK.21.21	Slash to the right, turn to the left—wherever your blade is meeting! 
EZK.21.22	I also will clap My hands together. So I will satisfy My wrath. I, 
EZK.21.23	The word of 
EZK.21.24	“Now you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them should originate from the same land. Mark a signpost; cut it out at the start of the road to the city. 
EZK.21.25	You are to mark out a way, so the sword can come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon and to Judah in fortified Jerusalem. 
EZK.21.26	For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the start of the two roads, to seek divination. He shakes the arrows, consults the idols, he looks in the liver. 
EZK.21.27	In his right hand is the lot for Jerusalem—to set up battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with a war cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build a siege wall. 
EZK.21.28	It will seem to them like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he will remember their iniquity, so they may be seized.” 
EZK.21.29	Therefore thus says 
EZK.21.30	So you, wicked one, prince of Israel, the day has come to be slain, the time of final punishment.” 
EZK.21.31	Thus says 
EZK.21.32	Ruin, ruin, I will make it a ruin! Even this will not be, until He comes to whom belongs the judgment, and I give it to Him. 
EZK.21.33	“Now you, son of man, prophesy and say, thus says 
EZK.21.34	while they see false visions for you, while they divine lies for you —to lay you out on the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, in the time of the final punishment. 
EZK.21.35	Return to its sheath! In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. 
EZK.21.36	I will pour out My indignation on you. I will blow on you with the fire of My fury. I will hand you over to brutal men, skilled to destroy. 
EZK.21.37	You will be fuel for the fire. Your blood will be throughout the land. You will not be remembered. For I, 
EZK.22.1	The word of 
EZK.22.2	“You, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the bloody city? So explain to her all her abominations. 
EZK.22.3	Say, thus says 
EZK.22.4	You have become guilty in your blood that you have spilled, and are defiled by your idols that you have made. So you have brought your days near, and have come up to your years. Therefore I have made you a disgrace to the nations and a mockery to all the lands. 
EZK.22.5	Those near and far from you will mock you—with a defiled name and full of turmoil.’ 
EZK.22.6	“Behold, each prince of Israel has used his own arm’s strength in you to shed blood. 
EZK.22.7	Father and mother have been treated with contempt; the outsider has been oppressed in your midst; the orphan and the widow have been mistreated in you. 
EZK.22.8	You have despised My holy things and profaned My 
EZK.22.9	Slanderous men are in you in order to shed blood. They have eaten at the mountain shrines; they commit immoral acts in your midst. 
EZK.22.10	They have uncovered their fathers’ nakedness in you; they violate women that are in 
EZK.22.11	One has been detestable with his neighbor’s wife; another has wickedly defiled his daughter-in-law; yet another has violated his sister, his father’s daughter, in you. 
EZK.22.12	They accept bribes in order to shed blood in you; you have taken usurious interest. You have greedily gained by oppressing your neighbors, and you have forgotten Me.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.22.13	“Now look, I clap My hands at your dishonest gain that you have made and at your bloodshed in your midst. 
EZK.22.14	Will your heart’s courage stand or your hands be strong in the days when I deal with you? I, 
EZK.22.15	I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you throughout the lands. I will purge your uncleanness from you. 
EZK.22.16	You will be defiled in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.22.17	The word of 
EZK.22.18	“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me—all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace—they are the dross of silver.” 
EZK.22.19	Therefore, thus says 
EZK.22.20	As one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so I will gather you in My anger and in My fury. I will put you in and melt you. 
EZK.22.21	I will gather you and blow the fire of My wrath upon you, so you may be melted in the midst of it. 
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the furnace, so will you be melted within it. So you will know that I 
EZK.22.23	The word of 
EZK.22.24	“Son of man, say to her: ‘You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation.’ 
EZK.22.25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing prey. They have devoured lives, they take wealth and valuables, they multiply widows in her midst. 
EZK.22.26	Her 
EZK.22.27	Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing at prey, spilling blood and destroying lives for dishonest gain. 
EZK.22.28	Her prophets have plastered them with whitewash, seeing false visions and predicting lies to them, saying ‘Thus says 
EZK.22.29	“The people of the land have oppressively blackmailed, plundered in robbery, wronged the poor and needy and abused the outsider unjustly. 
EZK.22.30	I searched for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it, but I found no one. 
EZK.22.31	Therefore I have poured out My fury on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; I have brought their own way upon their heads.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.23.1	The word of 
EZK.23.2	“Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. 
EZK.23.3	They were harlots in Egypt; they were harlots in their youth; their bosoms were caressed there and their virgin breasts were fondled. 
EZK.23.4	Their names were Oholah, the older one, and Oholibah, her sister. They became Mine, and they gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. 
EZK.23.5	“Oholah prostituted herself, though she was Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, warriors, 
EZK.23.6	dressed in blue, governors and rulers, all of them handsome young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
EZK.23.7	She prostituted herself with them, all of the choice men of Assyria. She defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. 
EZK.23.8	She did not give up her harlotry in Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her. They fondled her virgin breasts and poured out their lust on her. 
EZK.23.9	Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, whom she lusted after. 
EZK.23.10	They stripped her naked, they took her sons and her daughters and slaughtered her with the sword. She became notorious among women. Judgments were executed upon her. 
EZK.23.11	“Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more depraved in her lust than her sister and her promiscuous acts worse. 
EZK.23.12	She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, warriors splendidly clad, horsemen riding on horses, all of them handsome young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she defiled herself; they both went the same way. 
EZK.23.14	But she kept increasing her harlotry. She saw men carved on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans carved in red, 
EZK.23.15	girded with sashes on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them had the appearance of officers, the likeness of Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth. 
EZK.23.16	As soon as she saw them she lusted after them. She sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	The Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and defiled her with their lust. Yet when she was defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. 
EZK.23.18	When she exposed her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness, My soul was disgusted by her, just as My soul was disgusted by her sister. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her harlotry—remembering the days of her youth, when she was a harlot in the land of Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like that of horses. 
EZK.23.21	So you revisited the promiscuity of your youth, when the Egyptians used to fondle your bosom and youthful breasts. 
EZK.23.22	“Therefore Oholibah, thus says 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa and Koa and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, governors and rulers all of them, commanders and officers, all of them riding on horses. 
EZK.23.24	They will come against you with armed chariots, whirling wheels and an assembly of people. They will set themselves against you on every side with armor, shield and helmet. I will delegate judgment to them, so they will judge you according to their standards of justice. 
EZK.23.25	I will vent My jealousy against you, letting them deal with you in fury. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters, and your survivors will be devoured by fire. 
EZK.23.26	They will strip your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry. 
EZK.23.27	I will put an end to you and your immorality brought from the land of Egypt. You will no longer lift your eyes toward them or remember Egypt anymore.” 
EZK.23.28	For thus says 
EZK.23.29	They will treat you with hatred, take all your property and leave you naked and exposed. The vulgarity of your prostitutions will be uncovered—your debauchery and your promiscuity. 
EZK.23.30	These things will be done to you, for you have gone as a harlot after the nations, so you are defiled with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You have walked in the way of your sister, so I will give her cup into your hand.” 
EZK.23.32	Thus says 
EZK.23.33	You will be filled with drunkenness and agony, a cup of horror and desolation—the cup of your sister Samaria. 
EZK.23.34	You will drink it and drain it, gnaw its shards and tear your breasts. For I have spoken.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus says 
EZK.23.36	Then 
EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols and even offered their children, whom they bore for Me, to be devoured. 
EZK.23.38	Again, this they have done to Me—they defiled My Sanctuary on the same day and profaned My 
EZK.23.39	On the same day that they slaughtered their children to their idols, they came into My Sanctuary to profane it. See, that is what they have done within My House! 
EZK.23.40	“Furthermore, they sent for men who come from far away. A messenger was sent to them, and look, they came! For them you bathed, painted your eyes and decked yourself with jewelry.
EZK.23.41	You sat on a glorious bed, with a table arranged before it, on which you set out My incense and My oil. 
EZK.23.42	The sound of a carefree crowd was with her. Many of the men who came from the desert were drunkards. They put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads.” 
EZK.23.43	Then I said about her, worn out from harlotry: “Still they commit immorality with her—even her? 
EZK.23.44	They keep going to her, as they go to a prostitute. So they went to Oholah and to Oholibah—the obscene women. 
EZK.23.45	Righteous men would judge them as adulteresses are judged and as those who shed blood are judged. For they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.” 
EZK.23.46	For thus says 
EZK.23.47	The assembly will stone them to death and dispatch them with their swords. They will slaughter their sons and daughters. They will burn down their houses. 
EZK.23.48	So I will make obscenity cease from the land, that all women may be taught not to imitate your obscenity. 
EZK.23.49	They will repay you both for wickedness and you will bear the sins of your idols. So you will know that I am 
EZK.24.1	The word of 
EZK.24.2	“Son of man, record this date, this exact day—this very day the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem. 
EZK.24.3	Utter a parable concerning the rebellious house. Say to them, thus says 
EZK.24.4	Gather the pieces into it, every good piece —thigh and shoulder. Fill it with the choice bones. 
EZK.24.5	Take the choicest of the flock and pile the bones under it; bring it to a rolling boil, so that its bones also seethe in it.’” 
EZK.24.6	Therefore thus says 
EZK.24.7	For her bloodshed is in her midst. She put it on the bare rock; she did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust. 
EZK.24.8	So it stirs up wrath for taking vengeance. I have put her blood on the bare rock, that it may not be covered.” 
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus says 
EZK.24.10	heaping on the wood, kindling the fire, boiling the meat well, and mixing in spices. But let the bones be burned! 
EZK.24.11	I will set it empty upon the coals until it gets hot and its copper scorches, so its impurity will be melted, its corrosion consumed. 
EZK.24.12	It has wearied toil, yet its thick rust will not come out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion! 
EZK.24.13	Because of your filthy obscenity, though I tried to purify you yet you were not made pure, you will never be cleansed from your filth until I have satisfied My fury on you. 
EZK.24.14	I, 
EZK.24.15	The word of 
EZK.24.16	“Son of man, behold, I am about to take away the desire of your eyes with a single blow. But do not lament, do not weep or allow any tears to flow. 
EZK.24.17	Sigh silently, do not observe mourning for the dead, keep your turban fastened, and keep your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.” 
EZK.24.18	So I spoke to the people in the morning and my wife died in the evening. In the morning I did just as I was commanded. 
EZK.24.19	The people said to me, “Won’t you tell us what these things you are doing mean to us?” 
EZK.24.20	Then I said to them, “The word of 
EZK.24.21	speak to the house of Israel, thus says 
EZK.24.22	You will do just as I have done: you will not cover your upper lips or eat the bread of mourners. 
EZK.24.23	Your turbans will remain on your heads and your shoes on your feet—you will not lament or weep. But you will pine away in your iniquities and groan to each other. 
EZK.24.24	Ezekiel will be a sign for you; just as he has done, you will do. When this comes, you will know that I am 
EZK.24.25	“You, son of man, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, the longing of their soul, as well as their sons and their daughters—
EZK.24.26	on that day a fugitive will come to you to tell you the news. 
EZK.24.27	On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped. You will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am 
EZK.25.1	The word of 
EZK.25.2	“Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon and prophesy against them. 
EZK.25.3	Say to the children of Ammon—hear the word of 
EZK.25.4	therefore behold, I will give you over to the children of the east as a possession. They will set up their camps among you and make their dwellings among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk. 
EZK.25.5	I will make Rabbah a grazing place for camels and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.25.6	For thus says 
EZK.25.7	therefore behold, I will stretch out My hand over you. I will deliver you as plunder for the nations. I will cut you off from the people. I will cause you to perish from among the countries. I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.25.8	Thus says 
EZK.25.9	therefore behold, I will expose the mountain slope of Moab with all its cities, from its frontier cities, the glorious country of Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. 
EZK.25.10	I will deliver it, together with the children of Ammon, to the children of the east as a possession, so that the children of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. 
EZK.25.11	Then I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.25.12	Thus says 
EZK.25.13	therefore thus says 
EZK.25.14	I will take My vengeance upon Edom by the hand of My people Israel. They will do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury. They will know My vengeance.’” It is a declaration of 
EZK.25.15	Thus says 
EZK.25.16	therefore thus says 
EZK.25.17	I will execute severe vengeance upon them with furious punishments. So they will know that I am 
EZK.26.1	On the first day of the month in the eleventh year, the word of 
EZK.26.2	“Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, ‘Aha, she is shattered, the gateway of the peoples—she is turned over to me! I will be filled, now that she is laid waste!’ 
EZK.26.3	Therefore thus says 
EZK.26.4	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers. I will sweep her dust from her and make her a bare rock. 
EZK.26.5	She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea. For I have spoken it.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.26.6	and her daughters in the field will be slain by the sword. So they will know that I am 
EZK.26.7	For thus says 
EZK.26.8	He will slaughter your daughters in the field with the sword. He will build siege works against you, cast up an assault ramp against you and raise up shields against you. 
EZK.26.9	He will thrust his battering engines against your walls. He will tear down your towers with his weapons. 
EZK.26.10	You will be covered with dust from the multitude of his horses. At the noise of the horsemen, wheels and chariots, your walls will shake, when he enters your gates, as men enter a breached city. 
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword. The pillars of your strength will come down to the ground. 
EZK.26.12	They will rob your riches and plunder your merchandise. They will tear down your walls and destroy your fine houses. They will cast your stones and your lumber and your dust into the midst of the sea. 
EZK.26.13	I will put an end to the sound of your songs. The sound of your lyres will no longer be heard. 
EZK.26.14	I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets, you will be built no more; for I, 
EZK.26.15	Thus says 
EZK.26.16	Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones. They will cast aside their robes. They will take off their richly woven garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground. They will tremble every moment and be appalled at you. 
EZK.26.17	They will lift a lament for you and say to you: ‘How you have perished —you who were inhabited from the seas, the renowned city, strong in the sea, you and your inhabitants, who spread their terror for all your inhabitants! 
EZK.26.18	Now the coastlands will tremble in the day of your downfall. The islands of the sea will be terrified at your demise.’” 
EZK.26.19	For thus says 
EZK.26.20	then I will bring you down with them who descend into the Pit, to the people of long ago. I will make you dwell in the lowest parts of the earth, like the waste places of old, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or radiate splendor in the land of the living. 
EZK.26.21	I will make you a horror, and you will no longer exist. Though you are sought for, you will never be found again.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.27.1	The word of 
EZK.27.2	“You, son of man, lift up a lament for Tyre. 
EZK.27.3	Say to Tyre, dwelling at the entrance of the sea, the merchant to the people of many coastlands, thus says 
EZK.27.4	Your borders are in the heart of the seas, your builders perfected your beauty. 
EZK.27.5	All your planks have been fashioned from cypress trees of Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. 
EZK.27.6	They made your oars from Bashan’s oaks. Of boxwood from the islands of Kittim they made your decks, inlaid with ivory. 
EZK.27.7	Fine Egyptian linen was your sail, serving as a banner for you. Your awning was blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah. 
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your skilled men, Tyre, were on you —they were your sailors. 
EZK.27.9	The elders of Gebal and her experts were within you, caulking your leaks. All the ships of the sea with their sailors were with you to trade for your wares. 
EZK.27.10	Persia, Lud and Put were in your army, our men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in you; they gave you splendor. 
EZK.27.11	Men of Arvad and Helech were all around on your walls, the Gammadim were in your towers. They hung their shields all around on your walls. They perfected your beauty. 
EZK.27.12	“‘Tarshish was your trading partner because of the abundance of all riches. With silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for your merchandise. 
EZK.27.13	Javan, Tubal and Meshech were your traffickers—they gave lives of people and vessels of bronze for your wares. 
EZK.27.14	Those from the house of Togarmah traded for your merchandise with horses, steeds and mules. 
EZK.27.15	The men of Dedan traded with you; many coastlands were your customers; they brought you horns of ivory and ebony as your payment. 
EZK.27.16	Aram was your customer because of your abundant goods—they traded for your merchandise with emerald, purple and embroidered cloth, fine linen, coral and rubies. 
EZK.27.17	Judah and the land of Israel were your customers; they traded for your wares with wheat of Minnith, confections, honey, oil and balm. 
EZK.27.18	Damascus was your customer because of the abundance of your goods and all your great wealth, with the wine of Helbon and wool of white. 
EZK.27.19	Vedan and Javan from Uzal traded for your wares—ironwork, cinnamon and spices were bartered for your merchandise. 
EZK.27.20	Dedan was your dealer in saddlecloth for riding. 
EZK.27.21	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your favored trading partners in lambs, rams and goats; in these they were your customers. 
EZK.27.22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were your vendors—they traded for your wares with the finest spices, all precious stones and gold. 
EZK.27.23	Haran and Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad traded with you. 
EZK.27.24	They traded for your merchandise with gorgeous fabrics, garments of blue and richly woven work, carpets of multi-colored material, with cords twisted and tightly knotted. 
EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish serve as carriers for your wares. “‘So you were filled and heavily loaded in the heart of the seas. 
EZK.27.26	Your rowers have brought you into great waters. But the east wind will break you in the heart of the seas. 
EZK.27.27	Your riches, your wares, your merchan­dise, your sailors, your pilots, your caulkers, the traders of your merchandise, all your men of war that are in you, with all your company in your midst will fall into the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall. 
EZK.27.28	At the sound of the cry of your pilots the countryside will shake. 
EZK.27.29	All the oarsmen, the sailors and all the mariners of the sea will come down from their ships to stand on the ground. 
EZK.27.30	They will raise their voices over you and cry bitterly. They will throw up dust on their heads. They will roll themselves in ashes. 
EZK.27.31	They will shave themselves bald for you and put on sackcloth. They will weep for you with bitter soul, with bitter lament. 
EZK.27.32	In their wailing they will take up a lament for you. They will mourn over you: “Who was like Tyre—silenced in the midst of the sea?” 
EZK.27.33	When your merchandise came out from the seas, you satisfied many people. With the abundance of your wealth and your wares you enriched the kings of the earth. 
EZK.27.34	Now you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters. Your merchandise and all your company have fallen in your midst. 
EZK.27.35	All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you. Their kings are horribly afraid, their faces are convulsed. 
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the people hiss at you. You have become a horror and will be no more.’”
EZK.28.1	The word of 
EZK.28.2	“Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, thus says 
EZK.28.3	See, you are wiser than Daniel! No secret is hidden from you! 
EZK.28.4	By your wisdom and by understanding you have made wealth for yourself and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries. 
EZK.28.5	In your great skill, by your trade, you have increased your wealth, so your heart is exalted by your wealth.’” 
EZK.28.6	Therefore thus says 
EZK.28.7	behold, I will bring strangers against you, the ruthless of the nations. They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom. They will defile your splendor. 
EZK.28.8	They will bring you down to the Pit. You will die the death of those slain in the heart of the seas. 
EZK.28.9	Will you still say, ‘I am a god’ before the one who slays you? Yet you are man, and not a god, in the hand of those who pierce you. 
EZK.28.10	You will die the deaths of the uncircumcised at the hand of strangers. For I have spoken.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.28.11	The word of 
EZK.28.12	“Son of man, lift up a lament for the king of Tyre. Say to him, thus says 
EZK.28.13	You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering —ruby, topaz and diamond, beryl, onyx and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and emerald—your settings and your sockets a workmanship of gold —in the day you were created they were prepared. 
EZK.28.14	You were an anointed guardian cheruv. I placed you on the holy mountain of God. You walked among stones of fire. 
EZK.28.15	You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. 
EZK.28.16	By the abundance of your trade they filled you within with violence. So you have sinned. So I threw you out as a profane thing from the mountain of God. I made you vanish, guardian cheruv, from among the stones of fire. 
EZK.28.17	Your heart was exalted because of your beauty. You corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I threw you down to the earth. Before kings I set you up as a spectacle. 
EZK.28.18	“‘By the multitude of your iniquities, in the injustice of your trade, you profaned your sanctuaries. So I brought fire out from within you, and it has consumed you. I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the eyes of all who saw you. 
EZK.28.19	All who know you among the people will be appalled at you. You have become a horror and will be nothing forever.’” 
EZK.28.20	The word of 
EZK.28.21	“Son of man, set your face toward Sidon and prophesy against her. 
EZK.28.22	Say, thus says 
EZK.28.23	I will send a plague to her and blood in her streets. The wounded will fall in her midst by the sword on every side. So they will know that I am 
EZK.28.24	“Never again will there be a briar pricking at the house of Israel or a piercing thorn from any around them who scorn them. They will know that I am the Lord 
EZK.28.25	Thus says 
EZK.28.26	They will live safely there, and they will build houses and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I have executed judgments on all those around them that treated them with contempt. So they will know that I am 
EZK.29.1	On the twelfth day of the tenth month of the tenth year, the word of 
EZK.29.2	“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt. Prophesy against him and against all Egypt, 
EZK.29.3	speak and say, thus says 
EZK.29.4	I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will haul you up from within your rivers and all the fish of your streams will stick to your scales. 
EZK.29.5	I will leave you in the desert —you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field. You will not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food for the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky. 
EZK.29.6	Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am 
EZK.29.7	When they took hold of you by the hand, you snapped and tore all their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you broke and wrenched all their hips.’” 
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus says 
EZK.29.9	The land of Egypt will become desolate and waste. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.29.10	therefore behold, I am against you and against your rivers. I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia.
EZK.29.11	No human foot will pass through it, and no foot of beast will pass through it. It will be uninhabited for 40 years. 
EZK.29.12	I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among devastated countries. Her cities will be a desolation 40 years among ruined cities. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.” 
EZK.29.13	For thus says 
EZK.29.14	I will restore the fortunes of Egypt. I will cause them to return to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin. But they will be a lowly kingdom there. 
EZK.29.15	It will be the lowliest of the kingdoms. It will no longer exalt itself above the nations. I will diminish them, so that they no longer rule over the nations. 
EZK.29.16	It will no longer be as security for the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their turning after them. So they will know that I am 
EZK.29.17	On the first day of the first month of the twenty-seventh year, the word of 
EZK.29.18	“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head became bald and every shoulder chafed. But he and his army had no profit from Tyre for the labor that he had expended against it.” 
EZK.29.19	Therefore thus says 
EZK.29.20	I have given him the land of Egypt as his wages for which he served, because they worked for Me.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.29.21	“In that day I will cause a horn to shoot up for the house of Israel. I will open your mouth among them. They will know that I am 
EZK.30.1	The word of 
EZK.30.2	“Son of man, prophesy, and say, thus says 
EZK.30.3	For the day is near, the day of 
EZK.30.4	A sword will come against Egypt. Anguish will be in Ethiopia when the slain fall in Egypt. They will take away her abundance. Her foundations will be torn down. 
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia, Put and Lud, all the mixed people, Libya, and children of the covenant land will fall with them by the sword.’” 
EZK.30.6	Thus says 
EZK.30.7	“They will be desolate among desolate lands. Her cities will be among ruined cities. 
EZK.30.8	They will know that I am 
EZK.30.9	“On that day, messengers will go out from before Me in ships to frighten Ethiopians out of complacency. Anguish will come on them as on the day of Egypt—for, behold, it is coming!” 
EZK.30.10	Thus says 
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the ruthless of the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain. 
EZK.30.12	I will make the rivers dry. I will sell the land into the hand of evildoers. I will make the land desolate, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers. I, 
EZK.30.13	Thus says 
EZK.30.14	I will make Pathros desolate. I will set a fire in Zoan. I will execute judgments in No. 
EZK.30.15	I will pour My fury on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt. I will cut off the multitude of No. 
EZK.30.16	I will set a fire in Egypt. Sin will writhe in anguish. No will be assaulted. Noph will face enemies daily. 
EZK.30.17	The young men of Aven and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword and the women will go into captivity. 
EZK.30.18	In Tehaphnehes the day will grow dark when I break the yokes of Egypt there. The pride of her power will cease in her —a cloud will cover her. Her daughters will go into captivity. 
EZK.30.19	So I will execute judgments in Egypt, and they will know that I am 
EZK.30.20	On the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year, the word of 
EZK.30.21	“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Behold, it has not been bound up to be healed or put in a splint, so that it is wrapped up with a bandage, to grow strong to wield the sword.” 
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus says 
EZK.30.23	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. 
EZK.30.24	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword into his hand. I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so he will groan before him like a fatally wounded man. 
EZK.30.25	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but Pharaoh’s arms will fall. So they will know that I am 
EZK.30.26	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.31.1	On the first day of the third month of the eleventh year, the word of 
EZK.31.2	“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: ‘Who is like you in your greatness? 
EZK.31.3	Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches shadowing the forest, of lofty height. Its top was in leafy branches. 
EZK.31.4	Water nourished it, the deep made it tall, with its rivers going around its planting as it sent out its water-courses to all the trees of the field. 
EZK.31.5	Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field. Its branches multiplied and its boughs became long because of the abundant water in its shoots. 
EZK.31.6	All the birds of the sky nested in its branches. All the beasts of the field gave birth to their young under its branches. All great nations lived under its shade. 
EZK.31.7	It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was in abundant water. 
EZK.31.8	The cedars in the garden of God could not compare with it. No cypress trees could rival its boughs. No plane-trees could match its branches. No tree in the garden of God could compare to its beauty. 
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful with its many limbs. All the trees of Eden in God’s garden envied it.’” 
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus says 
EZK.31.11	I gave it into the hand of a ruler of nations, who surely dealt with it. I drove it out as befits its wickedness. 
EZK.31.12	Ruthless barbarians from the nations cut it down. They cast it down on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches fell. Its branches have laid broken in all the streambeds of the land. All the people of the earth have come out from its shade and abandoned it. 
EZK.31.13	All the birds of the sky lived on its fallen trunk and all the beasts of the field upon its fallen branches. 
EZK.31.14	So none of all the trees by the water should exalt themselves in their height or set their top among the leafy boughs. None of their well-watered mighty ones should attain their height. For they have all been given to death, to the lowest regions under the earth, among the children of men who go down to the Pit.” 
EZK.31.15	Thus says 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall, when I cast him down to 
EZK.31.17	They also went down with him to 
EZK.31.18	‘Who is like you in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? You will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth. You will lie among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.’ This is Pharaoh and all his multitude.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.32.1	On the first day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year, the word of 
EZK.32.2	“Son of man, lift up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: ‘You compare yourself to a young lion of the nations, but you are a crocodile in the waters. You thrash about in your rivers and muddy the water with your feet and foul their streams.’” 
EZK.32.3	Thus says 
EZK.32.4	I will leave you on the land. I will hurl you on an open field. I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle upon you. I will gorge the beasts of the whole earth with you. 
EZK.32.5	I will strew your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your refuse. 
EZK.32.6	I will drench the land with the flow of your blood up to the hills. The ravines will be full of you. 
EZK.32.7	When I extinguish you, I will cover the sky and darken the stars. I will cover the sun with cloud, and the moon will not give her light. 
EZK.32.8	I will darken all of heaven’s bright lights over you and set darkness on your land.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.32.9	“I will disturb the hearts of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations, into lands you have not known. 
EZK.32.10	I will make many people appalled at you. Their kings will be totally aghast at you when I brandish My sword over you. They will shudder every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of your downfall.” 
EZK.32.11	For thus says 
EZK.32.12	By the swords of the mighty I will cause your multitude to fall. They are all ruthless among the nations. They will devastate the pride of Egypt. All of its multitude will be annihilated. 
EZK.32.13	I will destroy all the beasts from beside plentiful water. No human foot will muddy them again, nor will hoofs of beasts muddy them. 
EZK.32.14	Then I will make their waters settle and make their streams flow like oil.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.32.15	“When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste when it was previously full, when I strike all that live there, they will know that I am 
EZK.32.16	This is the funeral song —chant it, daughters of the nations, chant for Egypt. All her multitude will chant it.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.32.17	On the fifteenth day of the month in the twelfth year, the word of 
EZK.32.18	“Son of man, wail over Egypt’s throng. Bring them down —her and the daughters of lofty nations, to the underworld, to those who go down to the pit. 
EZK.32.19	Who do you surpass in beauty? Go down, lie with the uncircumcised. 
EZK.32.20	They fall among those slain by the sword. She is given over to the sword. They drag her down with all her throng. 
EZK.32.21	The strongest warriors will speak of him and his allies from the midst of 
EZK.32.22	“Assyria is there and all her company, their graves surround them —all of them slain, fallen by the sword. 
EZK.32.23	Her graves are set in the deepest parts of the Pit. Her company surrounds her grave —all of them slain, fallen by the sword —who put terror in the land of the living. 
EZK.32.24	“There is Elam and all her multitude surrounding her grave —all of them slain, fallen by the sword —who went down uncircumcised into the underworld, who caused terror in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit. 
EZK.32.25	They have made her a bed among the slain with all her throng, her graves about them —all of them uncircumcised, slain, fallen by the sword— though they caused terror in the land of the living. So they bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit. They are laid among the slain. 
EZK.32.26	“Meshech-Tubal is there and all her throng, her graves around them —all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they spread their terror in the land of the living. 
EZK.32.27	They do not lie with the mighty, the fallen from among the uncircumcised, who went down to 
EZK.32.28	You also will be shattered and lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. 
EZK.32.29	“Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with those slain by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the Pit. 
EZK.32.30	“The princes of the north are there, all of them, all the Zidonians, who have gone down with the slain, ashamed for all the terror that they caused by their might. They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword. They bear their disgrace with those who go down to the pit. 
EZK.32.31	When Pharaoh sees them, he will be comforted for all his throng, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.32.32	“For I have put My terror in the land of the living. He will lie among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.33.1	The word of 
EZK.33.2	“Son of man, speak to the children of your people and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword upon a land, suppose the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him as their watchman. 
EZK.33.3	If, when he sees the sword coming upon the land, he blows the 
EZK.33.4	then whoever hears the sound of the 
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the 
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman sees the sword come and does not blow the 
EZK.33.7	“You, son of man, I have set you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear the word from My mouth, warn them from Me. 
EZK.33.8	When I say to the wicked: ‘Wicked one, you will surely die!’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked about his way—that wicked one will die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. 
EZK.33.9	If you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he does not turn from his way, then he will die in his iniquity—but you have saved your soul. 
EZK.33.10	“You, son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘You have said, “Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we are pining away in them. So how can we live.” 
EZK.33.11	Say to them: ‘As I live’—it is a declaration of 
EZK.33.12	“You, son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous person will not deliver him in the day of his transgression. Nor will the wickedness of the wicked person make him stumble in it on the day he turns away from his wickedness. Nor will the righteous person be able to live by it on the day he sins. 
EZK.33.13	 When I tell the righteous that he will surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered. But in his iniquity that he has committed, he will die. 
EZK.33.14	When I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” yet he turns from his sin and does what is just and right—
EZK.33.15	if the wicked restores a pledge, gives back what he had taken by robbery, walks in the laws of life, committing no iniquity—he will surely live, he will not die. 
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he will surely live.’ 
EZK.33.17	“Yet the children of your people say, ‘The way of

EZK.33.19	When a wicked person turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live by it. 
EZK.33.20	Yet you say, ‘The way of

EZK.33.22	The hand of 
EZK.33.23	Then the word of 
EZK.33.24	“Son of man, the inhabitants of these ruins in the land of Israel keep saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he inherited the land. Since we are many, the land is given to us as a possession.’ 
EZK.33.25	“Therefore say to them, thus says 
EZK.33.26	You rely on your sword, commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you possess the land?’ 
EZK.33.27	Say this to them, thus says 
EZK.33.28	I will make the land a desolation and a horror. The pride of her power will cease. The mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will pass through.’ 
EZK.33.29	They will know that I am 
EZK.33.30	“Now as for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses. Each one speaks to one another, each saying to his brother: ‘Come now, hear what message is coming forth from 
EZK.33.31	So they come to you, as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words—but they do not do them—for with their mouth they express doting love, but their heart goes after their own dishonest gain. 
EZK.33.32	Look, you are like a love song to them, one who has a beautiful voice and can play well on an instrument. They hear your words, but do not practice them. 
EZK.33.33	When this comes to pass—behold, it is coming—they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
EZK.34.1	The word of 
EZK.34.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, thus says 
EZK.34.3	You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fat ones. But you do not take care of the sheep. 
EZK.34.4	You do not strengthen the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring back the stray or seek the lost. Instead, you have ruled over them with force and cruelty. 
EZK.34.5	They were scattered for lack of a shepherd. They became food for all the beasts of the field as they were scattered. 
EZK.34.6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Over all the face of the earth My sheep were scattered. No one searched. No one sought.” 
EZK.34.7	Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of 
EZK.34.8	“As I live”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.34.9	therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of 
EZK.34.10	thus says 
EZK.34.11	For thus says 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeks out his sheep on the day he is among his scattered flock, so I will seek out My sheep. I will rescue them out of all the places where they have been scattered, on a day of cloud and thick darkness. 
EZK.34.13	I will bring them out from the peoples. I will gather them from the countries. I will bring them back to their own land. I will shepherd them upon the mountains of Israel, by the streams and in all the habitable places of the land. 
EZK.34.14	I will shepherd them in a good pasture—their grazing place will be on the high mountains of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground. They will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I will tend My flock and make them lie down”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.34.16	“I will seek the lost, bring back the stray, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick. But the fat and the strong I will destroy—I will tend them with justice. 
EZK.34.17	As for you, My flock”—thus says 
EZK.34.18	Was it too little for you that you were feeding in the good pasture? Must you trample down the rest of your pastures with your feet? You were drinking clear water. Must you muddy the rest with your feet? 
EZK.34.19	Yet My sheep must eat what you have trampled with your feet and drink what you have muddied with your feet!” 
EZK.34.20	Therefore thus says 
EZK.34.21	Because you thrust with your side and with shoulder and gore all the weak with your horns, until you have scattered them all over, 
EZK.34.22	I will save My flock. They will no longer be prey. I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
EZK.34.23	So I will set up One Shepherd over them, My servant David—He will tend them, He will feed them Himself and be their shepherd. 
EZK.34.24	I, 
EZK.34.25	“I will make a covenant of 
EZK.34.26	I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. I will cause the rain to come down in its season. There will be showers of blessing. 
EZK.34.27	The tree of the field will yield its fruit. The ground will yield its produce. They will be secure in their land. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.34.28	They will no longer be prey to the nations. The beast of the earth will not devour them. They will live in security. No one will make them afraid. 
EZK.34.29	I will make their agriculture renowned. They will no longer be consumed with hunger in the land. They will no longer bear the scorn of the nations. 
EZK.34.30	They will know that I, 
EZK.34.31	“So you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are human, and I am your God.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.35.1	The word of 
EZK.35.2	“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it. 
EZK.35.3	Say to it, thus says 
EZK.35.4	I will lay your cities waste. You will be devastated. So you will know that I am 
EZK.35.5	“Because you have a long-standing hatred and have delivered 
EZK.35.6	therefore, as I live’—it is a declaration of 
EZK.35.7	I will make Mount Seir an utter desolation. I will cut off from it all who come and go. 
EZK.35.8	I will fill its mountains with its slain; on your hills, your valleys and all your streams those slain by the sword will fall. 
EZK.35.9	I will make you everlasting desolations; your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am 
EZK.35.10	“Because you said: ‘These two nations and these two lands will be mine! We will possess them’—though 
EZK.35.11	“therefore, as I live”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.35.12	You will know that I, 
EZK.35.13	You have magnified yourselves against Me with your mouth. You multiplied your words against Me. I heard it.” 
EZK.35.14	Thus says 
EZK.35.15	As you rejoiced over inheriting the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir and all Edom—all of it. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.36.1	“You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say: ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of 
EZK.36.2	Thus says 
EZK.36.3	Therefore prophesy and say, thus says 
EZK.36.4	therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of 
EZK.36.5	Therefore thus says 
EZK.36.6	Therefore, prophesy to the land of Israel and say to the mountains and the hills, the streams and the valleys, thus says 
EZK.36.7	Therefore thus says 
EZK.36.8	“‘But you, mountains of Israel, you will shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit for My people Israel; for their return is near. 
EZK.36.9	For behold, I am for you. I will turn to you. You will be tilled and sown. 
EZK.36.10	I will settle a large population upon you—the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities will be inhabited. The desolate places will be built up. 
EZK.36.11	I will multiply man and beast upon you. They will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before. I will do better for you than at your beginnings. You will know that I am 
EZK.36.12	I will cause people, my people Israel, to walk upon you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance. You will no longer deprive them of children.’” 
EZK.36.13	Thus says 
EZK.36.14	therefore you will no longer devour men and you will no longer deprive your nation of children.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.36.15	“I will no longer let the scorn of the nations be heard against you. You will no longer bear disgrace from the peoples. You will no longer cause your nation to stumble.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.36.16	The word of 
EZK.36.17	“Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their deeds. Their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her 
EZK.36.18	So I poured out My fury on them for the blood which they had shed upon the land and because they had defiled it with their idols. 
EZK.36.19	I scattered them among the nations, so they were dispersed through the countries. According to their way and their deeds I judged them. 
EZK.36.20	Wherever they went among the nations, they profaned My holy Name, since it was said about them, ‘These are the people of 
EZK.36.21	But I had concern for My holy Name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations wherever they went. 
EZK.36.22	“Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus says 
EZK.36.23	I will sanctify My great Name, which has been profaned among the nations—which you have profaned among them. The nations will know that I am 
EZK.36.24	“‘For I will take you from the nations, gather you out of all the countries and bring you back to your own land. 
EZK.36.25	Then I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean from all your uncleanness and from all your idols. 
EZK.36.26	Moreover I will give you a new heart. I will put a new spirit within you. I will remove the stony heart from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 
EZK.36.27	I will put My 
EZK.36.28	Then you will live in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be My people and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	“So I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful. I will not bring a famine upon you. 
EZK.36.30	I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that you will no longer bear the disgrace of famine among the nations. 
EZK.36.31	When you remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, you will be disgusted with yourselves because of your iniquities and your abominations. 
EZK.36.32	Not for your sake will I do this”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.36.33	Thus says 
EZK.36.34	The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a wasteland in the sight of all that passed by. 
EZK.36.35	They will say, ‘This land that was a wasteland has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’ 
EZK.36.36	Then the nations that are left all around you will know that I, 
EZK.36.37	Thus says 
EZK.36.38	Like the holy flock, like the flock of Jerusalem during her 
EZK.37.1	The hand of 
EZK.37.2	He led me all around them. Behold, there were very many on the floor of the valley. Behold, they were very dry. 
EZK.37.3	Then He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I answered, “
EZK.37.4	“Prophesy over these bones,” He said to me. “Say to them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of 
EZK.37.5	Thus says 
EZK.37.6	I will attach tendons to you, bring flesh on you and cover you with skin. Then I will put breath in you. You will live. You will know that I am 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied just as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its bone. 
EZK.37.8	I saw, and behold, there were tendons on them, flesh came up and skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them. 
EZK.37.9	Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the 
EZK.37.10	So I prophesied just as He commanded me. The 
EZK.37.11	Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say: ‘Our bones are dried up; our hope is lost; we are cut off—by ourselves.’ 
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy and say to them, thus says 
EZK.37.13	You will know that I am 
EZK.37.14	I will put My 
EZK.37.15	The word of 
EZK.37.16	“You, son of man, take one stick and write on it, ‘For Judah’—for 
EZK.37.17	Join them one to another for yourself, as one stick, so they may become one in your hand. 
EZK.37.18	“When the children of your people speak to you saying, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by these?’ 
EZK.37.19	say to them, thus says 
EZK.37.20	The sticks that you write on will be in your hand before their eyes. 
EZK.37.21	“Then say to them, thus says 
EZK.37.22	I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will be king to them all. They will no longer be two nations and never again be divided into two kingdoms. 
EZK.37.23	They will never again be defiled with their idols, their detestable things or with any of their transgressions. I will save them out of all their dwellings in which they sinned. I will purify them. Then they will be My people and I will be their God. 
EZK.37.24	My servant David will be king over them. They will all have One Shepherd. They will walk in My ordinances and observe My rulings and do them. 
EZK.37.25	They will live in the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, where your ancestors lived. They will live there—they, their children and their children’s children, forever, and My servant David will be their prince forever. 
EZK.37.26	I will cut a covenant of 
EZK.37.27	My dwelling-place will be over them. I will be their God and they will be My people. 
EZK.37.28	Then the nations will know that I am 
EZK.38.1	The word of 
EZK.38.2	“Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him 
EZK.38.3	and say, thus says 
EZK.38.4	I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws. I will bring you out, with all your army, horses and horsemen—all of them splendidly dressed—a vast assembly with breastplate and shield, all of them wielding swords. 
EZK.38.5	With them will be Persia, Cush and Put, all of them with shield and helmet, 
EZK.38.6	Gomer and all his troops, the house of Togarmah from the extreme north and all his troops—many peoples with you. 
EZK.38.7	“‘Be prepared, prepare yourself, you and all your company gathered around you. Be a guard for them. 
EZK.38.8	After many days you will be summoned. In the latter years, you will come against the land that has been brought back from the sword and regathered from many peoples on the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. But they were brought out from the peoples. When all of them are dwelling securely, 
EZK.38.9	you will come up, you will come like a storm, you will be like a cloud covering the land—you and all your troops and many peoples with you.’” 
EZK.38.10	Thus says 
EZK.38.11	You will say, ‘I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who live securely, all of them living without walls, having no bars or gates, 
EZK.38.12	in order to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places now inhabited and against the people gathered from the nations, who have been acquiring livestock and property, who live in the center of the world.’ 
EZK.38.13	“Sheba, Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its young lions will say to you: ‘Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your company to plunder? To carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and property, to make off with immense spoils?’ 
EZK.38.14	“Therefore, son of man, prophesy, say to Gog, thus says 
EZK.38.15	You will come from your place out of the extreme north—you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and mighty army. 
EZK.38.16	You will come up against My people Israel like a cloud covering the land. It will happen in the last days. I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me—when I am sanctified through you, Gog, before their eyes.’” 
EZK.38.17	Thus says 
EZK.38.18	In that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.38.19	In My jealousy and the fire of My wrath I have spoken! Surely in that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. 
EZK.38.20	The fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep upon the ground and all humans upon the face of the earth will shake at My presence. The mountains will be thrown down. The steep places will fall. Every wall will fall to the ground. 
EZK.38.21	I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.38.22	I will punish him with pestilence and blood. I will pour out rain on him, on his troops and on the many peoples with him, a torrential rain, with hailstones, fire and brimstone. 
EZK.38.23	So I will magnify and sanctify Myself. I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations, and they will know that I am 
EZK.39.1	“You, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, thus says 
EZK.39.2	I will turn you around, drive you along, and lead you up from the extreme north. I will bring you upon the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.39.3	Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. 
EZK.39.4	You will fall on the mountains of Israel—you, all your troops and the people that are with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of birds of prey and to the beasts of the field. 
EZK.39.5	You will fall on an open field, for I have spoken.’” It is a declaration of 
EZK.39.6	“I will send fire on Magog and on those who live securely in the islands. Then they will know that I am 
EZK.39.7	So I will make My holy Name known among My people Israel. I will not let My holy Name be profaned anymore. The nations will know that I am 
EZK.39.8	Behold, it is coming. It will be done”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.39.9	“The inhabitants of Israel’s cities will go out and kindle fires with the weapons—shields and breastplates, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears. They will make fires with them for seven years. 
EZK.39.10	They will not take wood out of the field or cut anything from the forests, for they will make fire from the weapons. They will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.39.11	“On that day, I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of the travelers east of the sea. It will block those who travel through, since they will bury Gog and all his multitude there. Then they will call it the valley of Hamon-Gog. 
EZK.39.12	The house of Israel will bury them for seven months, in order to cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.13	All the people of the land will bury them. It will be memorable for them, a day when I am glorified.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.39.14	“Men will be continually set apart to travel through the land and bury the travelers remaining on the face of the land, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months, they will make their search. 
EZK.39.15	When they travel through the land, if any sees a man’s bone, he will set up a sign by it, until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. 
EZK.39.16	Hamonah will also be the name of the city. So they will cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.17	“You, son of man”—thus says 
EZK.39.18	You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth—as rams, lambs, goats, bulls—all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
EZK.39.19	So you will eat fat until you are gorged and you will drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrificial feast that I have prepared for you. 
EZK.39.20	You will be filled at My table with horses and horsemen, with mighty men and all the warriors.’” It is a declaration of 
EZK.39.21	“I will put My glory among the nations. All the nations will see My judgment that I will execute and My hand that I will lay on them. 
EZK.39.22	The house of Israel will know that I am 
EZK.39.23	The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they broke faith with Me. So I hid My face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies. All of them fell by the sword. 
EZK.39.24	I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions. I hid My face from them.” 
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus says 
EZK.39.26	They will bear their shame and all their disloyalty by which they broke faith with Me, when they were living securely in their land, with no one making them afraid. 
EZK.39.27	When I have brought them back from the peoples and have gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, I will be sanctified in them in the eyes of many nations. 
EZK.39.28	Then they will know that I am 
EZK.39.29	I will never again hide My face from them. For I have poured out My 
EZK.40.1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month—in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day—the hand of 
EZK.40.2	In visions God brought me to the land of Israel and set me down upon a very high mountain. On it, toward the south, was something like the construction of a city. 
EZK.40.3	He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze. He had a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod. He was standing in the gateway. 
EZK.40.4	The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, set your heart on all that I show you—for I brought you here in order to show you—and report all that you see to the house of Israel.” 
EZK.40.5	Behold, an outer wall was all around the House. The measuring rod in the man’s hand was six cubits long, each of which was a normal cubit and a handbreadth. When he measured the thickness of the wall structure, it was one rod, and the height was one rod. 
EZK.40.6	Then he went to the gate that faced east and went up its steps. When he measured the threshold of the gate, it was one rod wide. Also the other threshold was one rod wide. 
EZK.40.7	Each guard chamber was one rod long and one rod wide. The space between the chambers was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate, facing the House, measured one rod. 
EZK.40.8	When he measured the porch of the gate toward the House, it was one rod. 
EZK.40.9	When he measured the porch of the gate, it was eight cubits; its pillars were two cubits. The porch of the gate faced the House. 
EZK.40.10	Now the guard chambers of the east gate were three on this side, and three on the other side—the three had the same measurement. The side pillars had the same measure on this side and on that side. 
EZK.40.11	When he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, it was ten cubits, and the length of the gate was 13 cubits. 
EZK.40.12	A barrier wall was in front of the guard chambers, one cubit on each side. Each chamber was six cubits on each side. 
EZK.40.13	When he measured the gate from the roof of the one chamber to the roof of the other, the width was 25 cubits, door facing door. 
EZK.40.14	Then he did the pillars—60 cubits. A gateway extended all around to the pillar of the courtyard. 
EZK.40.15	Now from the front of the gate of the entrance to the front of the inner porch of the gate measured 50 cubits. 
EZK.40.16	There were shuttered windows toward the chambers and toward their pillars within the surrounding gate, and likewise the porches had windows all around inside. On each pillar were palm trees. 
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me to the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and pavement, made for the surrounding court, with 30 rooms along the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	The pavement was by the side of the gates, as wide as the gates were long. This was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	He measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court—it was 100 cubits, to the east and to the north. 
EZK.40.20	Next he measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court facing toward the north. 
EZK.40.21	Its guard chambers were three on this side and three on that side. Its pillars and its porches had the same measurements as the first gate—50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 
EZK.40.22	Its windows, porches and palm trees were the same measurements as the gate facing toward the east. Its stairway had seven steps, and its porch was in front of them. 
EZK.40.23	A gate to the inner court was opposite the other gate, northward and eastward. He measured 100 cubits from gate to gate. 
EZK.40.24	Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its pillars and its porches. They had the same measurements. 
EZK.40.25	The gate and its porch had windows all around, like the other windows, 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 
EZK.40.26	Its stairway had seven steps, and its porches were in front of them. It had palm-trees on its pillars, one on this side and another on that side. 
EZK.40.27	There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured from gate to gate toward the south—100 cubits. 
EZK.40.28	Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate. When he measured the south gate, it had the same measurements. 
EZK.40.29	Its chambers, pillars and porch had the same measurements. There were windows in it and in the surrounding porch. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 
EZK.40.30	There were porches all around, 25 cubits long and five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.31	Its porch was toward the outer court. Palm-trees were on its pillars. Its stairway had eight steps. 
EZK.40.32	Then he brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured it with the same measurements. 
EZK.40.33	Its chambers, pillars and porch had the same measurements. There were windows in it and in its surrounding porch. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 
EZK.40.34	Its porch was toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side. Its stairway had eight steps. 
EZK.40.35	He brought me to the north gate. He measured it with the same measurements: 
EZK.40.36	its chambers, pillars and porch. There were windows in it all around. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 
EZK.40.37	Its pillars were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its pillars, on this side and on that side. Its stairway had eight steps. 
EZK.40.38	A chamber with its entry was by the pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering. 
EZK.40.39	In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering. 
EZK.40.40	Off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables. On the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables. 
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on one side and four tables were on the other side, by the side of the gate—eight tables, on which they would slaughter. 
EZK.40.42	There were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high. The instruments for the slaughter of the burnt offering and the sacrifice were laid on them. 
EZK.40.43	Hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened in the House all around. The flesh of the offering was to be placed upon the tables. 
EZK.40.44	Outside the inner gate in the inner court were chambers for the singers, one of which was at the side of the north gate, facing south. The one at the side of the east gate faced north. 
EZK.40.45	He said to me, “This chamber that faces toward the south is for the 
EZK.40.46	The chamber that faces toward the north is for the 
EZK.40.47	Then he measured the court. It was 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide, a square. The altar was in front of the House. 
EZK.40.48	He brought me to the porch of the House. He measured each pillar of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. 
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch was 20 cubits and the width 11 cubits. It was ascended by way of steps, where pillars stood, one on each side.
EZK.41.1	Then he brought me to the Temple, and measured the pillars—six cubits wide on one side, six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent. 
EZK.41.2	The width of the entrance was ten cubits. The sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, 40 cubits and its width, 20 cubits. 
EZK.41.3	He went to the inner room and measured each pillar of the entrance, two cubits; the doorway, six cubits; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits. 
EZK.41.4	When he measured the inner room’s length, it was 20 cubits, and the width was 20 cubits, in front of the Temple. He said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.” 
EZK.41.5	When he measured the wall of the House, it was six cubits, and the width of every side chamber was four cubits, surrounding the House on every side. 
EZK.41.6	There were 33 side chambers. There were supports in the wall, which belonged to the House for the side chambers all around, so that they were not supported by the wall of the House. 
EZK.41.7	The side chambers were wider as they wound about higher and higher. Because the winding about of the House went higher and higher round about the house, therefore the width of the House expanded. One went up from the lowest row to the highest by way of the middle. 
EZK.41.8	I saw also that the House had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six cubits up to the joint. 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The space between the side chambers of the House 
EZK.41.10	and the outer chambers was 20 cubits wide all around the House on every side. 
EZK.41.11	The doors of the side chambers were toward the space, one door toward the north and another door toward the south. The width of the space was five cubits all around. 
EZK.41.12	The building that was before the separate area at the side toward the west was 70 cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around and its length was 90 cubits. 
EZK.41.13	When he measured the House, it was 100 cubits long; the separate area and the building with its walls, was 100 cubits long; 
EZK.41.14	and the width of the face of the House and the separate area toward the east was also 100 cubits. 
EZK.41.15	When he measured the length of the building facing the separate area behind it, with its galleries on each side, it was 100 cubits. Now the inner Sanctuary and the porches of the court—
EZK.41.16	the thresholds, the shuttered windows, and the galleries all around in three stories opposite the thresholds—were paneled with wood all around, from the ground up to the windows (even the windows were covered), 
EZK.41.17	over the space above the door, as far as the inner House, and on all the wall outside all around inside and outside, by measurement. 
EZK.41.18	It was made with 
EZK.41.19	the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. Thus was it made on all the House all around. 
EZK.41.20	The 
EZK.41.21	The Temple’s doorposts were square. Now the front of the Sanctuary had something resembling 
EZK.41.22	an altar—three cubits high and two cubits long, made of wood. Its corners, its base and its sides were also of wood. He said to me, “This is the table of the Presence of 
EZK.41.23	The Temple and the inner Sanctuary each had double doors. 
EZK.41.24	The doors each had two turning leaves—two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other. 
EZK.41.25	Cheruvim and palm trees were made on them, on the doors of the Temple, just like those made on the walls. There were thick beams of wood on the face of the porch outside. 
EZK.41.26	There were shuttered windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch, the side chambers of the House and the thick beams. 
EZK.42.1	He led me out to the outer courtyard toward the north. He brought me to the chamber that was opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north. 
EZK.42.2	The length of the building with the door on the north was 100 cubits and the width was 50 cubits. 
EZK.42.3	Opposite the 20 cubit space belonging to the inner court and opposite the pavement belonging to the outer court was gallery by gallery in three stories. 
EZK.42.4	In front of the chambers was a walkway ten cubits wide and 100 cubits long. Their doorways were toward the north. 
EZK.42.5	The upper chambers were narrower, because the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and the middle ones in the building. 
EZK.42.6	For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards; therefore more space was taken away than from the lower and the middle floors, in comparison with the ground. 
EZK.42.7	A wall that was outside by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers, was 50 cubits in length. 
EZK.42.8	For the chambers that were toward the outer court were 50 cubits long while those facing the Temple were 100 cubits. 
EZK.42.9	Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard. 
EZK.42.10	In the thickness of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, in front of the separate area and in front of the building, there were chambers. 
EZK.42.11	The passageway in front of them were similar to the chambers on the north, as long and wide as them, with all their exits and similar arrangements and doors.
EZK.42.12	Corresponding to the doorways of the chambers on the south, there was a doorway at the head of the passageway—a way directly in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them. 
EZK.42.13	Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate area, they are the holy chambers, where the 
EZK.42.14	Once the 
EZK.42.15	When he had finished measuring the inner House, he brought me out by way of the gate facing east and measured all around. 
EZK.42.16	When he measured the east side with the measuring rod, it was 500 rods, with the measuring rod round about. 
EZK.42.17	When he measured the north side, it was 500 rods by the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.18	When he measured the south side, it was 500 rods, with the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.19	Then he turned about to the west side and measured 500 rods with the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.20	So he measured the four sides. It had a wall all around—the length was 500 and the width was 500—to make a distinction between the holy and the profane. 
EZK.43.1	Then he led me to the gate, the gate looking east, 
EZK.43.2	and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters. The earth was radiant with His glory. 
EZK.43.3	The appearance of the vision that I saw was like the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar. So I fell on my face. 
EZK.43.4	Then the glory of 
EZK.43.5	The 
EZK.43.6	Then I heard someone speaking to me from the House, while a man was standing beside me. 
EZK.43.7	He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne, the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of 
EZK.43.8	Whenever they set their threshold next to My threshold and their doorpost next to My doorpost, with only a wall between Me and them, they defiled My holy Name by their abominations that they committed. So I have finished them off in My fury. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their prostitution and the corpses of their kings, far from Me. Then I will dwell among them forever. 
EZK.43.10	“You, son of man, describe the House to the house of Israel, so they will be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure accurately. 
EZK.43.11	If they are ashamed of all they have done, sketch out the House for them, its layout, its exits and its entrances, its complete design, with all its ordinances and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so they may observe its complete design and all its ordinances and do them. 
EZK.43.12	This is the 
EZK.43.13	“These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (a cubit being a normal cubit plus a handbreadth). Its gutter will be a cubit deep and a cubit wide. Its rim will be one span surrounding the edge. This will be the base of the altar. 
EZK.43.14	From the base on the ground to the lower ledge will be two cubits and the width one cubit. From the smaller ledge to the larger ledge will be four cubits and the width a cubit. 
EZK.43.15	The altar hearth will be four cubits high. Four horns will project upward from the hearth. 
EZK.43.16	The hearth will be 12 cubits long by 12 wide, with four sides square.
EZK.43.17	The ledge will be 14 cubits long and 14 wide with four sides square. The border surrounding it will be half a cubit and its bottom will be a cubit all around. Its steps will face east.” 
EZK.43.18	Then he said to me, “Son of man, thus says 
EZK.43.19	Give a young bull for a sin offering to the Levitical 
EZK.43.20	“You are to take some of its blood and put it on its four horns, on the four corners of the ledge and on the border around it. So you will purify it and make atonement for it. 
EZK.43.21	Take the bull of the sin offering and burn it in the appointed place of the House, outside the Sanctuary. 
EZK.43.22	“On the second day, offer a male goat without blemish as a sin offering. They will purify the altar as they purified it with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished purifying it, offer a young bull without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 
EZK.43.24	Present them before 
EZK.43.25	Every day for seven days, prepare a goat as a sin offering. They will prepare a young bull and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
EZK.43.26	They will make atonement for the altar and cleanse it for seven days. This is how they will consecrate it. 
EZK.43.27	When they have completed the days, from the eighth day and onward the 
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the Sanctuary looking east. It was shut.
EZK.44.2	 said to me: “This gate is to be shut. It must not be opened. No one may enter through it, for 
EZK.44.3	Only the prince, since he is a prince, will sit there to eat bread before 
EZK.44.4	Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the House. I looked, and behold, the glory of 
EZK.44.5	 said to me, “Son of man, set your heart, behold with your eyes and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of 
EZK.44.6	Say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, thus says 
EZK.44.7	You brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My Sanctuary, to profane it—My House—when you offer My bread, the fat and the blood. They have broken My covenant, to add to all your abominations. 
EZK.44.8	You have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set keepers of My service in My Sanctuary to please yourselves.’” 
EZK.44.9	Thus says 
EZK.44.10	For the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray after their idols, will bear their iniquity. 
EZK.44.11	Yet they will be ministers in My Sanctuary, overseers of the gates of the House and ministering in the House. They will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people. They will stand before them to minister to them. 
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up My hand against them”—it is a declaration of 
EZK.44.13	They will not come near to Me, to minister to Me as 
EZK.44.14	“Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the House, for all its service and for all that will be done in it. 
EZK.44.15	So the Levitical 
EZK.44.16	“They are ones who will enter My Sanctuary and draw near to My table to minister to Me. They will keep My charge. 
EZK.44.17	It will be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they will be clothed with linen garments. No wool will come on them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. 
EZK.44.18	They will have linen turbans upon their heads and linen underclothes upon their loins; they will not wear anything that causes sweat. 
EZK.44.19	Before they go out to the outer court—to the outer courtyard to the people—they must take off their garments in which they minister and leave them in the holy chambers. They will put on other garments, so they do not consecrate the people while in their garments. 
EZK.44.20	They must not shave their heads or let their locks grow long, but must carefully trim the hair of their heads. 
EZK.44.21	No 
EZK.44.22	None may take a widow or a divorced woman as his wife, for they must take virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel or a widow who is the widow of a 
EZK.44.23	“They will teach My people the difference between the holy and the common and explain to them the difference between the unclean and the clean. 
EZK.44.24	In a lawsuit, they will stand to judge, and judge in accordance with My ordinances. They will keep My laws and My statutes in all My 
EZK.44.25	They must not come near a dead person to defile themselves—only for a father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister who had no husband may they defile themselves. 
EZK.44.26	After he is cleansed, they will count seven days for him.
EZK.44.27	On the day he goes into the Sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the Sanctuary, he is to offer his sin offering.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.44.28	“It will be an inheritance for them. I am their inheritance. Do not give them any possession in Israel for I am their possession. 
EZK.44.29	They will eat the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering. Every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	The first of all the firstfruits of everything and every offering of every kind from all your offerings will belong to the ­
EZK.44.31	The 
EZK.45.1	“When you allot the land for inheritance, set apart an offering to 
EZK.45.2	Out of this, there will be the Holy Place, 500 long by 500 wide, square all around, and 50 cubits for the open land surrounding it. 
EZK.45.3	From this area you are to measure a length of 25,000 and a width of 10,000, in which will be the Sanctuary, which is most holy. 
EZK.45.4	It is to be the holy portion of the land, for the 
EZK.45.5	An area 25,000 long by 10,000 wide will be for the Levites, the ministers of the House. It will be a possession for themselves—20 chambers. 
EZK.45.6	“You will give the city possession of an area 5,000 wide by 25,000 long, alongside the offering of the holy allotment. It will be for the whole house of Israel.
EZK.45.7	“The prince will have a portion on either side of the holy allotment and the city’s property, adjacent to the holy offering and the city’s property, on the west side westward and on the east side eastward. Its length will correspond to one of the tribal portions, from the western boundary to the eastern boundary. 
EZK.45.8	It will be land for him as a possession in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress My people. They will give land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.” 
EZK.45.9	Thus says 
EZK.45.10	“You are to have just balances, an honest dry measure and an honest liquid measure. 
EZK.45.11	The dry and liquid measure will be of a uniform measure: the bath will contain a tenth part of a homer, and the ephah a tenth part of a homer; the standard measure will be the homer. 
EZK.45.12	The shekel will be 20 gerahs; 20 plus 25 plus 15 shekels will be your mina. 
EZK.45.13	“This is the offering that you are to set apart: a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of barley, 
EZK.45.14	along with the set portion of oil—a bath of oil—as the tithe of the bath for each kor, which is ten baths (or a homer, since ten baths are a homer), 
EZK.45.15	and one lamb of the flock out of 200, from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offering, burnt offering and fellowship offerings, to make atonement for them.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.45.16	“All the people of the land must give this contribution to the prince in Israel. 
EZK.45.17	It will be the prince’s role to give the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the feasts, New Moons and 
EZK.45.18	Thus says 
EZK.45.19	The 
EZK.45.20	So you will do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance. So you will make atonement for the House. 
EZK.45.21	“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you will have the Passover, a feast of seven days when 
EZK.45.22	On that day the prince will prepare a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land. 
EZK.45.23	He will prepare a burnt offering to 
EZK.45.24	He will prepare as a grain offering, an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram and a hin of oil for each ephah. 
EZK.45.25	He will do this in the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, during the Feast, for seven days, for sin offering as well as burnt offering, grain offering as well as oil.”
EZK.46.1	Thus says 
EZK.46.2	The prince will enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside, and stand by the post of the gate. Then the 
EZK.46.3	The people of the land will worship at the door of that gate before 
EZK.46.4	“The burnt offering that the prince offers to 
EZK.46.5	The grain offering will be an ephah for the ram. The grain offering for the lambs will be a gift of his hand and a hin of oil for an ephah. 
EZK.46.6	On the day of the New Moon it will be a young bull without blemish, six lambs and a ram—they must be without blemish. 
EZK.46.7	He will prepare a grain offering, an ephah for the bull and an ephah for the ram, for the lambs whatever his hand may reach and a hin of oil for an ephah. 
EZK.46.8	When the prince enters, he will enter by way of the porch of the gate and he will also exit by that way. 
EZK.46.9	When the people of the land come before 
EZK.46.10	When they enter, the prince will come in among them. When they go out, they will go out together. 
EZK.46.11	“At the feasts and the 
EZK.46.12	Now if the prince prepares a freewill offering, burnt offering or fellowship offerings as a freewill offering to 
EZK.46.13	“You are to prepare a lamb of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering to 
EZK.46.14	Also you will prepare a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour—a grain offering to 
EZK.46.15	They will prepare the lamb, the grain offering and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.” 
EZK.46.16	Thus says 
EZK.46.17	But if he gives of his inheritance as a gift to one of his servants, it will be his until the year of liberty, when it will revert to the prince. His inheritance will belong to his sons. 
EZK.46.18	The prince must not take from the people’s inheritance, evicting them wrongfully out of their property. He must give inheritance to his sons out of his own property, so that My people will not be displaced, anyone from his own property.” 
EZK.46.19	Then he brought me through the entrance that was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the 
EZK.46.20	He said to me, “This is the place where the 
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me out to the outer courtyard and led me past the four corners of the courtyard. Behold, in every corner of the courtyard there was another courtyard. 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the courtyard there were enclosed courts, 40 cubits long by 30 wide—these four in the corners had the same size. 
EZK.46.23	There was a row of masonry surrounding them, surrounding the four. Boiling places were built under the surrounding rows. 
EZK.46.24	He said to me, “These are the boiling places where the ministers of the House will boil the sacrifices of the people.”
EZK.47.1	Then he brought me back to the door of the House. Behold, water was flowing out from under the threshold of the House eastward—for the front of the House faced east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the House, south of the altar. 
EZK.47.2	He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around outside by the way of the outer gate, the way of the gate looking east. Behold, water was trickling out from the right side. 
EZK.47.3	When the man went out eastward with a line in his hand, he measured a 1,000 cubits. Then he led me into the water—water to the ankles. 
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a 1,000, and led me into the water—water to the knees. Again he measured a 1,000, and he led me into the water—water up to the waist. 
EZK.47.5	Again he measured a 1,000, and now it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen, water to swim in—a river that could not be crossed. 
EZK.47.6	He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man?” Then he brought me back to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	When I had returned, behold, there were very many trees on one side and on the other, along the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.8	Then he said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region. They go down to the Arabah and enter the sea. When they arrive at the sea, the waters of the sea will flow and will become fresh. 
EZK.47.9	It will be that every living creature that swarms will live wherever the rivers go. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because this water goes there and makes the salt water fresh. So everything will be healed and live wherever the river goes. 
EZK.47.10	Fishermen will stand by it; from En-gedi to En-eglaim, it will be a place for spreading of nets. Their fish will be of many different kinds—like the fish of the Great Sea, a huge quantity. 
EZK.47.11	Its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be set aside for salt. 
EZK.47.12	On the river, on its bank, on this side and that side, will grow every kind of tree for food. Its leaf will not wither; its fruit will not fail; it will bear new fruit every month, because its water flows out from the Sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food and its leaf will be for healing.” 
EZK.47.13	Thus says 
EZK.47.14	You will inherit it, each one like another, as I lifted My hand to give to your fathers. So this land will fall to you as an inheritance. 
EZK.47.15	“This will be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea, by way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad—
EZK.47.16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	So the border from the sea will be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern side. 
EZK.47.18	The east side, between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead and the land of Israel, will be by the Jordan. You will measure from the northern border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern side. 
EZK.47.19	The south side southward will be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the Wadi of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This will be the southern side toward the south. 
EZK.47.20	The west side will be the Great Sea, from the southern border as far as the front of the entrance of Hamath. This will be the western side. 
EZK.47.21	You are to divide this land for yourselves to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	So you are to divide it by lot for an inheritance for you and for the outsiders who dwell among you, whoever bears children among you. They will be to you like the native-born of 
EZK.47.23	In whatever tribe the outsider lives, there you will give him his inheritance.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.48.1	“Now these are the names of the tribes: Dan’s portion will be from the northern frontier, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the northern border of Damascus, beside Hamath, and from eastern side to the sea.
EZK.48.2	Next to the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west will be Asher’s one, 
EZK.48.3	Next to the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west will be Naphtali’s one. 
EZK.48.4	Next to the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, will be Manasseh’s one. 
EZK.48.5	Next to the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west will be Ephraim’s one. 
EZK.48.6	Next to the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, will be Reuben’s one. 
EZK.48.7	Next to the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, will be Judah’s one. 
EZK.48.8	By Judah’s border, from the east side to the west, will be the contribution which you will set aside, 25,000 cubits in width and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west. The Sanctuary will be in the midst of it. 
EZK.48.9	The allotment that you will set apart to 
EZK.48.10	The holy allotment will be apportioned for these—for the 
EZK.48.11	The sanctified portion will be for the 
EZK.48.12	It will be for them a portion set apart from the offering of the land, most holy, by the border of the Levites. 
EZK.48.13	Alongside the border of the 
EZK.48.14	They must not sell or exchange any of it or transfer the choice portion of the land, for it is holy to 
EZK.48.15	The 5,000 that remain in the width, in front of the 25,000 thousand, will be for common use, for the city, for living and for pastureland. “The city will be in the midst of it, 
EZK.48.16	and will have these measurements: the north side; 4,500; the south side 4,500; the east side, 4,500; and the west side, 4,500. 
EZK.48.17	The city will have open land: toward the north 250, toward the south 250, toward the east 250, and toward the west 250.
EZK.48.18	The remainder of the length, according to the holy allotment, will be 10,000 eastward and 10,000 westward. It will be alongside the holy allotment. Its produce will be food for those who serve the city. 
EZK.48.19	Those who serve the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, will till it. 
EZK.48.20	The whole allotment will be 25,o00 by 25,o00, square; you will set apart the holy allotment with the property of the city. 
EZK.48.21	“What is remaining from this side and on the other of the holy allotment and the city property will be for the prince. What is adjacent to the 25,000 of the allotment toward the eastern border, and westward adjacent to the 25,000 toward the western border, alongside the portions, will be for the prince. The holy allotment and the Sanctuary of the House will be in the midst of it. 
EZK.48.22	The property of the Levites and the property of the city will be in the middle of what belongs to the prince; what belongs to the prince will be between Judah’s border and Benjamin’s border. 
EZK.48.23	As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west, will be Benjamin’s one. 
EZK.48.24	Next to the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, will be Simeon’s one. 
EZK.48.25	Next to the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, will be Issachar’s one. 
EZK.48.26	Next to the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, will be Zebulon’s one. 
EZK.48.27	Next to the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, will be Gad’s one. 
EZK.48.28	Next to the territory of Gad, at the south side southward, the border will be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Wadi, to the Great Sea. 
EZK.48.29	This is the land that you will divide by lot to the tribes of Israel as an inheritance, and these are their portions.” It is a declaration of 
EZK.48.30	“These are the exits of the city: on the north side, 4,500 by measure, 
EZK.48.31	will be the gates of the city named after of the tribes of Israel—three gates northward—the Reuben Gate, one; the Judah Gate, one; the Levi Gate, one. 
EZK.48.32	At the east side, 4,500, will be three gates: the Joseph Gate, one; the Benjamin Gate, one; Dan Gate, one. 
EZK.48.33	At the south side, 4,500 by measure, will be three gates: the Simeon Gate, one; the Issachar Gate, one; the Zebulun Gate, one. 
EZK.48.34	At the west side, 4,500, with their three gates: the Gad Gate, one; the Asher Gate, one; the Naphtali Gate, one. 
EZK.48.35	It will be 18,000 cubits all around. “From that day on, the name of the city will be: ‘
HOS.1.1	The word of 
HOS.1.2	When 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 
HOS.1.4	Then 
HOS.1.5	In that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” 
HOS.1.6	Then she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And He said to him: “Name her Lo-ruhamah— for no longer will I have compassion on the house of Israel that I should ever pardon them. 
HOS.1.7	But on the house of Judah I will have compassion and deliver them by 
HOS.1.8	After she weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. 
HOS.1.9	Then He said: “Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people and I am not yours.” 
HOS.2.1	“Yet the number of 
HOS.2.2	Then the descendants of Judah and descendants of Israel will be gathered together. They will appoint themselves one head And they will go up from the land. For the day of Jezreel will be great. 
HOS.2.3	Say you to your brothers, ‘Ammi’ and to your sisters, ‘Ruhamah’. 
HOS.2.4	Contend with your mother, contend! For she is not My wife nor I her husband. Let her put away her fornications from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts. 
HOS.2.5	Or else I will strip her naked and expose her as on the day she was born. Then I will make her like a wilderness. Yes, I will make her like desert land, and I will let her die of thirst. 
HOS.2.6	I will have no compassion for her children, for they are children of prostitution. 
HOS.2.7	For their mother has practiced prostitution. She who conceived them has been shameful. For she said, ‘Let me go after my lovers, who are giving me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’ 
HOS.2.8	Therefore see, I will hedge her in with thorns, and I will build a wall around her so she cannot find her paths. 
HOS.2.9	Then she will chase after her lovers, but she will not overtake them. She will seek them, but not find. Then she will say: ‘Let me go and return to my first husband, for was it better for me then, than now.’ 
HOS.2.10	But she did not realize that I Myself gave her the grain, the wine and the fresh oil. I lavished on her silver, also gold— which they made into Baal. 
HOS.2.11	Therefore I will return and take back My grain in its season, and My new wine at its appointed time, and I will snatch away My wool and My linen for covering her nakedness. 
HOS.2.12	So now I will uncover her lewdness to the eyes of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from My hand. 
HOS.2.13	I will also put an end to all her rejoicing— her feasts, her New Moon, her Shabbat, and all her 
HOS.2.14	I will also devastate her vines and her fig trees, of which she said: ‘These are my payment that my lovers have given to me.’ But I will turn them into a thicket and beasts of the field will devour them. 
HOS.2.15	Then I will punish her for the days of the Baalim to whom she would burn incense— adorning herself with her rings and jewelry, going after her lovers— but Me she forgot.” It is a declaration of 
HOS.2.16	“So then, I Myself will entice her, I will bring her into the wilderness and speak to her heart. 
HOS.2.17	I will give her back her vineyards from there and make the valley of Achor a door of hope. She will respond there— as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
HOS.2.18	In that day—it is a declaration of 
HOS.2.19	Then I will remove the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, no longer to be mentioned by their name. 
HOS.2.20	In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the flying creatures in the sky, and the creeping things on the ground. I will break into pieces the bow and sword and warfare from the land, and I will cause them to lie down securely. 
HOS.2.21	Then I will betroth you to Me forever—yes, I will betroth you to Me with righteousness, justice, covenant loyalty and compassion. 
HOS.2.22	I will betroth you to Me with faithfulness, and you will know 
HOS.2.23	So it will be in that day, I will respond —it is a declaration of adonai— I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth, 
HOS.2.24	and the earth will respond with grain, new wine, and fresh oil— and they will respond with ‘Jezreel!’ 
HOS.2.25	I will sow her in the land for Myself. I will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah. I will say to Lo-ammi, ‘You are My people!’ and they will say, ‘My God!’”
HOS.3.1	Then 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and an omer and a half of barley. 
HOS.3.3	Then I said to her: “For many days you must stay with me. You must not practice prostitution. You must not have a man, and I will be the same toward you.” 
HOS.3.4	For 
HOS.3.5	Afterwards, 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of 
HOS.4.2	Curse, deceive, murder, steal, commit adultery! They practice violence, and bloodshed follows bloodshed. 
HOS.4.3	Therefore the land will mourn, and everyone dwelling in it will languish along with the beasts of the field and the flying creatures of the sky— even the fish of the sea will be removed. 
HOS.4.4	Yet let no one dispute and let no one argue. Your people are like a 
HOS.4.5	So you will stumble by day. Also a prophet will stumble with you by night, when I destroy your mother. 
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Since you rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from being My 
HOS.4.7	The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me. I will change their glory into disgrace. 
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sin of My people and relish their iniquity. 
HOS.4.9	But it will be like people, like 
HOS.4.10	They have eaten but will not be satisfied. They have fornicated but will not increase. For they stopped giving heed to 
HOS.4.11	Prostitution and wine—even new wine— it takes away understanding. 
HOS.4.12	My people consult their wooden idol and their divining rod informs them. For a spirit of prostitution leads them astray and they have been a prostitute— out from under their God. 
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice on the mountaintops and on the high places they burn incense under oak poplar, and terebinth— for its shade is good. Therefore your daughters are prostitutes and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 
HOS.4.14	Will I not punish your daughters for prostitution or your daughters-in-law for adultery? For they consort with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with cult prostitutes. A people without understanding will be thrust down. 
HOS.4.15	Though you, Israel, are a prostitute, let Judah not become guilty. But do not come to Gilgal or go up to Beth-aven, and do not swear: ‘As 
HOS.4.16	For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn cow. Now 
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone! 
HOS.4.18	Their liquor has come to an end. They surely have practiced prostitution. Her rulers have deeply loved disgrace. 
HOS.4.19	A wind will wrap her up in its wings. They will be ashamed of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear this, O priests! Pay attention, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For the judgment applies to you: For you were a snare at Mizpah and a net spread on Tabor. 
HOS.5.2	Rebels were deep in slaughter, so I am a chastisement for them all. 
HOS.5.3	I myself have known Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me. For now, Ephraim, you are a prostitute— Israel is defiled! 
HOS.5.4	They will not give up their evil deeds to return to their God. For a spirit of prostitution is in them, and 
HOS.5.5	The Pride of Israel will answer to his face: Israel and Ephraim will stagger in their iniquity, Judah also will stumble with them. 
HOS.5.6	With their flocks and with their herds they will go to seek 
HOS.5.7	They have betrayed 
HOS.5.8	Blow a 
HOS.5.9	Ephraim will become desolate in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I made known what is certain. 
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah were like those who move a boundary mark. I pour out My fury on them like water. 
HOS.5.11	Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed by judgment, for he willingly followed a worthless thing. 
HOS.5.12	So, I will be like a moth to Ephraim and like decay to the house of Judah. 
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent envoys to a warring king. But he cannot heal you nor will he cure your wound. 
HOS.5.14	For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away. I will carry off, and nobody will rescue. 
HOS.5.15	I will go and return to My place until they admit their guilt. Then they will seek My face. In their distress they will seek Me earnestly: 
HOS.6.1	Come, let us return to 
HOS.6.2	After two days He will revive us. On the third day He will raise us up, and we will live in His presence. 
HOS.6.3	So let us know, let us strive to know 
HOS.6.4	“O Ephraim, what shall I do for you? O Judah, what will I do for you? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud or like dew rising early, vanishing. 
HOS.6.5	Therefore I cut them down by the prophets. I slew them by the words of My mouth. Now the judgments pronounced against you: light will go forth. 
HOS.6.6	For I delight in loyalty and not sacrifice, knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
HOS.6.7	But like Adam, they transgressed a covenant. There they dealt treacherously with Me. 
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with bloody footprints. 
HOS.6.9	Like marauding bands waiting for a man, so a company of priests murders on the way toward Shechem. For they have committed crime. 
HOS.6.10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim’s prostitution is there, Israel has become unclean. 
HOS.6.11	Also, Judah, there is a harvest for you, when I return My people from captivity.”
HOS.7.1	“When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, even the wickedness of Samaria, for they practice fraud. So a thief breaks in; a marauding band will raid outside. 
HOS.7.2	But they never admit in their heart that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds are all around them. They are right before My face. 
HOS.7.3	They gladden the king with their evil and the princes with their lies. 
HOS.7.4	All of them are practicing adultery, as an oven heated by a baker who stops stirring or kneading dough when it is leavened. 
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king, princes become sick from wine. His hand drags scorners along. 
HOS.7.6	For their hearts are like an oven, as they wait in ambush. All night their anger smolders. In the morning it burns like a blazing fire. 
HOS.7.7	All of them are hot like an oven, and they devour their rulers. All of their kings have fallen. None among them calls on Me. 
HOS.7.8	Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples. Ephraim has become a pancake that never gets turned over. 
HOS.7.9	Strangers devoured his strength— yet he does not know it. Gray hairs have spread on him— and he does not know it. 
HOS.7.10	Though the Pride of Israel has answered him to his face, yet they did not return to 
HOS.7.11	Ephraim is like a senseless silly dove, they call to Egypt; they go to Assyria. 
HOS.7.12	As they are going, I will spread out My net over them, I will bring them down like a bird from the sky. I will chasten them as in the report that comes to their assembly. 
HOS.7.13	 to them! For they strayed from Me. Devastation to them! For they rebelled against Me. Should I redeem them after they spoke lies about Me? 
HOS.7.14	Nor did they not cry to Me in their heart when they were wailing on their beds. For the sake of grain and new wine they slash themselves— they keep turning away from Me. 
HOS.7.15	I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they kept planning evil against Me. 
HOS.7.16	They will turn back—only not upwards. They are like a treacherous bow. Their princes will fall by the sword because of the insolence with their tongues. This will be for their ridicule in the land of Egypt. 
HOS.8.1	“Put a 
HOS.8.2	 Will they cry out to Me, ‘My God, we—Israel—knew You’? 
HOS.8.3	Israel has rejected goodness— an adversary will pursue him. 
HOS.8.4	They crowned kings, but not by Me. They appointed princes I did not approve. Their silver and gold they made into idols— just so they would be cut down. 
HOS.8.5	Samaria! Your calf is thrown down! My anger is kindled against them! How long will they be incapable of innocence? 
HOS.8.6	For a craftsman from Israel made it, so it is no god. For the calf of Samaria will be splinters. 
HOS.8.7	“For they sow wind, and reap a whirlwind. There is no mature grain— the sprout yields no meal. Should it produce anything, strangers would swallow it up. 
HOS.8.8	Israel has been swallowed up! Now they are among the nations, like an ornament with no delight in it. 
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey alone by itself. Ephraim has hired lovers. 
HOS.8.10	Although they hire among the nations, I will now round them up. So they will begin to decrease under the burden of king and princes. 
HOS.8.11	“When Ephraim multiplied altars for making sin offerings, they became his altars for sinning. 
HOS.8.12	Though I were to write out for him ten thousand things from My 
HOS.8.13	Sacrifices are gifts for Me— should they sacrifice meat and then eat it? 
HOS.8.14	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built temples, while Judah has multiplied fortified cities. So I will send fire upon its cities that will consume their citadels.”
HOS.9.1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, do not celebrate like the peoples— for so you have gone whoring away from your God. You have loved a prostitute’s pay, on every grain-threshing-floor. 
HOS.9.2	Threshing-floor and wine-press will not sustain them, and new wine will fail her. 
HOS.9.3	They will not dwell in 
HOS.9.4	They will pour no wine-offerings to 
HOS.9.5	What will you do for a 
HOS.9.6	Look, even if they escape the desolation, Egypt will gather them up; Memphis will bury them. And their precious silver treasures? Weeds will possess them. Thorns will be in their tents. 
HOS.9.7	The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have come. Let Israel know! The prophet is a fool; the man of the spirit is mad! For great is your iniquity and great the hostility. 
HOS.9.8	Ephraim is a watchman with my God, a prophet. A bird catcher’s trap is on all his paths. Hostility is in the House of his God. 
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sin. 
HOS.9.10	“Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel. Like early fruit on a fig tree in its first season I saw your fathers. They came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame. So they became as detestable as the thing they loved. 
HOS.9.11	Ephraim’s glory flies away like a bird— no birth, no pregnancy, no conception! 
HOS.9.12	For if they should raise their children, I would make them childless to the last man. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them! 
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, as I have seen, is like Tyre, planted in a meadow, but Ephraim will bring his children out to the slayer.” 
HOS.9.14	Give them, 
HOS.9.15	“All their wickedness is at Gilgal, for there I despised them. Because of their wicked practices, I will drive them out of My House. I will love them no more. All their princes are rebellious. 
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is blighted; their root is withered; they bear no fruit. Even if they bring forth children, I will slay the cherished ones in their wombs.” 
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them off, since they did not listen to Him. So they will become wanderers among the nations. 
HOS.10.1	A luxuriant vine is Israel, who produces fruit for himself. Like the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars. Like the goodness of his land, they made beautiful sacred pillars. 
HOS.10.2	Their heart became smooth. Now they will bear their guilt. He will break down their altars. He will destroy their sacred pillars. 
HOS.10.3	Surely now they will say: “We have no king, for we have not feared 
HOS.10.4	They spoke words— empty oaths to make a covenant. But judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria will quarrel over the calves of Beth-aven. Indeed its people will mourn over it, but its priests will tremble over it. For its glory will surely depart from it. 
HOS.10.6	It also will be carried to Assyria as tribute to a warring king. Ephraim will receive shame and Israel will be put to shame by its own counsel. 
HOS.10.7	Samaria is being cut off. Her king is like a splinter on the surface of the water. 
HOS.10.8	The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel will be destroyed. Thorns and thistles will come up on their altars. And they will say to the mountains: “Cover us!” And to the hills: “Fall on us!” 
HOS.10.9	“From the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel. There they took their stand. Will not war over sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah? 
HOS.10.10	When I desire, I will chasten them, and peoples will gather against them when they are yoked to their two sins. 
HOS.10.11	Though Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, I put a yoke over her fair neck. I will make Ephraim pull; Judah will plow; Jacob will drag a harrow by himself.”
HOS.10.12	Sow for yourselves righteousness. Reap in accord with covenant love. Break up your unplowed ground. For it is time to seek 
HOS.10.13	You have plowed up wickedness, you have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of delusion, for you have trusted in your own way, in the multitude of your mighty men. 
HOS.10.14	A tumult will arise among your people. All your strongholds will be demolished, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle, when a mother was dashed in pieces with her children. 
HOS.10.15	Just so has Bethel done to you because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be utterly cut off.
HOS.11.1	“When Israel was a youth I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son. 
HOS.11.2	They called out to them but they departed from their presence. They kept sacrificing to the Baalim and burning incense up to idols. 
HOS.11.3	Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk. I took them on My arms. But they never acknowledged that I had healed them. 
HOS.11.4	With human cords I was drawing them, with bonds of love, and I became to them as One lifting a yoke from their jaws. I bent down to them and fed them. 
HOS.11.5	He will not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian will be his king— because they refused to return. 
HOS.11.6	So a sword will fall on his cities, and destroy and devour his gate bars because of their own counsels. 
HOS.11.7	So My people are bent on turning from Me. Although they are being called upwards, none will rise up. 
HOS.11.8	“How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I surrender you, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I set you as Zeboim? My heart is turning over within Me. My compassions are kindled. 
HOS.11.9	 I will not vent My fierce anger. I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I am God—not a man— the Holy One in the midst of you, and I will not come in fury.” 
HOS.11.10	They will walk after 
HOS.11.11	“They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, like a dove out of the land of Assyria, and I will settle them in their houses.” It is a declaration of 
HOS.12.1	“Ephraim surrounded Me with lies and the house of Israel with deceit.” Though Judah roams restlessly with God, yet he is faithful with holy things. 
HOS.12.2	Ephraim is grazing on wind and pursuing the east wind. All day he multiplies lies and ruin: making a pact with Assyria, while carrying oil to Egypt. 
HOS.12.3	 also has a dispute with Judah: He will punish Jacob for his ways, repaying him for his deeds. 
HOS.12.4	In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and in his vigor he strove with God. 
HOS.12.5	Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won; he wept and sought his favor. At Bethel he will find us, and there He will speak with us. 
HOS.12.6	Even 
HOS.12.7	So you should return to your God, keep covenant loyalty and justice, and wait for your God continually. 
HOS.12.8	A merchant loves to extort, with deceptive balances in his hand. 
HOS.12.9	Now Ephraim has said: “How rich I have become! I found wealth by myself. I won’t be guilty of any sin with any of my property.” 
HOS.12.10	“Yet I have been 
HOS.12.11	I also spoke through the prophets and I multiplied visions. Now through the prophets I will make parables. 
HOS.12.12	Since Gilead is full of iniquity, they are utterly worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls— even their altars will become heaps of rocks along the furrows of My field.” 
HOS.12.13	Now Jacob fled to the field of Aram, when Israel served for a wife— yes, he kept watch for a wife. 
HOS.12.14	So by a prophet 
HOS.12.15	Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his bloodguilt will remain on him— his Lord will repay him for his contempt.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, but he became guilty through Baal, and died. 
HOS.13.2	But now, they sin more and more. They made themselves molten images, idols skillfully made from their silver, all of them the work of the craftsmen. They say about them: “Let those who sacrifice kiss the calves.” 
HOS.13.3	Therefore they will be like morning clouds, like dew passing away early, like chaff blown from the threshing-floor, or like smoke from a chimney. 
HOS.13.4	“Yet I have been 
HOS.13.5	I Myself knew you in the wilderness, in a land of terrible drought. 
HOS.13.6	While they were fed, they were satisfied. Filled, their hearts became haughty. Therefore they forgot Me. 
HOS.13.7	So I became like a lion to them— like a leopard lying in wait by the way. 
HOS.13.8	I will meet them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and I will tear open their chests. There I will devour them like a lioness. A beast of the field will rip them to shreds. 
HOS.13.9	It has corrupted you, O Israel, for you are against Me— against your Helper! 
HOS.13.10	Where then is your king? So, will he save you in all your cities? Or your judges, to whom you said: ‘Give me a king and princes!’ 
HOS.13.11	I give you a king in My anger, and take him away in My wrath. 
HOS.13.12	Ephraim is bound by iniquity; his sin is treasured up. 
HOS.13.13	Pains of birth come on him. He is not a wise son. When the time comes, he should not delay at the opening of the womb. 
HOS.13.14	Should I ransom them from the hand of 
HOS.13.15	Because he is the son of kinsmen, he should have been fruitful. An east wind will come— the wind from 
HOS.14.1	Samaria will bear her guilt, for she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, their infants dashed to pieces, their pregnant women ripped open. 
HOS.14.2	Return O Israel, to 
HOS.14.3	Take words with you and return to 
HOS.14.4	‘Assyria will not save us. We will not ride on horses, and we will never again say, “Our god,” to the work of our hands, for with You, orphans find mercy.’” 
HOS.14.5	“I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely, for My anger will turn away from him. 
HOS.14.6	I will be like dew for Israel. He will blossom like a lily, and thrust out his roots like Lebanon. 
HOS.14.7	His tender shoots will spread out. His beauty will be like an olive tree and his fragrance will be like Lebanon. 
HOS.14.8	Those dwelling in his shadow will return. They will grow grain and bud like a vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon. 
HOS.14.9	Ephraim: “What more are idols to me? I have responded and observed Him. I will be like a luxuriant cypress tree. From me will be found Your fruit.” 
HOS.14.10	Who is wise? Let him discern these things. Who is intelligent? Let him know them. For the ways of 
JOL.1.1	The word of 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, elders! Give ear, all inhabitants of the land. Has this ever happened in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? 
JOL.1.3	Tell your children about it— your children to their children, their children to another generation. 
JOL.1.4	What the locust left, the swarming locust has eaten, and what the swarming locust left, the canker-worm has eaten, and what the canker-worm left, the caterpillar has eaten. 
JOL.1.5	Awake, drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine— on account of sweet wine, for it is denied to your mouth! 
JOL.1.6	For a nation has invaded my land. Vast—yes, without number! Its teeth are lion’s teeth, with jaw-teeth of a lioness. 
JOL.1.7	He has turned my vine to waste and my fig tree to splinters. He has stripped off all the bark and flung it down— its branches are left white. 
JOL.1.8	Wail like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth! 
JOL.1.9	Grain offering and drink offering are cut off from the House of 
JOL.1.10	The field is ruined, the land grieves, for the grain has been devastated, new wine is dried up, oil languishes. 
JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, O ploughmen; wail, O vinedressers, over wheat and over barley, for the harvest of the field is lost. 
JOL.1.12	The vine withered, the fig tree wilted. Pomegranate, palm and apple tree —all trees of the field— are withered, for joy has withered away from the children of men. 
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves and weep, 
JOL.1.14	Consecrate a fast. Proclaim a solemn assembly. Gather elders and all living in the land to the House of 
JOL.1.15	Ah, the day! The day of 
JOL.1.16	Is food not cut off before our eyes— joy and gladness from God’s House? 
JOL.1.17	Seed has shriveled under the dirt clod. Storehouses are desolate, granaries are torn down, for the grain has withered. 
JOL.1.18	How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep also suffer. 
JOL.1.19	To You, 
JOL.1.20	Also beasts of the field pant toward You. For the water of wadis are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. 
JOL.2.1	Blow the 
JOL.2.2	A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as blackness spreads over the mountains. A great and mighty people— from antiquity there was never anything like it, nor after it ever again from generation to generation. 
JOL.2.3	A fire devours before them and behind them flame blazes up. Like the Garden of Eden is the land before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. Nothing at all ever escapes them. 
JOL.2.4	Their appearance is like the appearance of horses— they gallop like war horses. 
JOL.2.5	Like the clatter of chariots, they leap on the tops of mountains, like crackling flame of fire devouring stubble, like a mighty horde in battle array. 
JOL.2.6	Before them peoples are in anguish. All faces become ashen gray. 
JOL.2.7	They run like mighty men. They climb a wall like men of war. They each march in line, never deviating from their ways. 
JOL.2.8	One does not crowd another. Each one marches on his own highway. They plunge through the weapons, never breaking off. 
JOL.2.9	They rush on the city, they run on the wall, they climb up into the houses, coming through the windows like a thief. 
JOL.2.10	Before them land quakes, heaven trembles, sun and moon become dark, stars withdraw their brightness. 
JOL.2.11	 utters His voice before His army. For His camp is very vast—for mighty is it that carries out His word. For great is the day of

JOL.2.19	 will answer and say to His people: “Behold, I will send you the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil, and you will be satisfied with it. I will no longer make you a mockery among the nations. 
JOL.2.20	“But I will remove the northern invader far from you—yes, I will banish him to a dry and desolate land— his vanguard into the Eastern Sea and his rearguard into the Western Sea. His odor will go up— Yes, his stench will rise.” For He has done great things! 
JOL.2.21	Do not fear, O land. Be glad! Rejoice! For 
JOL.2.22	Do not be afraid, beasts of the field, for the desert pastures have sprouted, for the tree bears its fruit. Fig tree and vine yield their strength. 
JOL.2.23	So be glad, children of Zion, and rejoice in 
JOL.2.24	The threshing floors will be full of grain and the vats will overflow with new wine and fresh oil. 
JOL.2.25	“I shall restore to you the years that the locust, the swarming locust, the canker-worm and the caterpillar have eaten— My great army that I sent among you.”

JOL.3.5	Then all who call on 
JOL.4.1	“For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore Judah and Jerusalem from exile, 
JOL.4.2	I will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. I will plead with them there on behalf of My people, even My inheritance, Israel, whom they scattered among the nations and they divided up My land. 
JOL.4.3	They cast lots for My people, traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, which they drank.” 
JOL.4.4	“Moreover, what are you to Me, Tyre and Sidon and all regions of Philistia? Did you render retribution for Me? Even if you were rendering retribution for Me, swiftly, speedily, will I return your retribution back on your own head. 
JOL.4.5	For you took My silver and My gold, and you carried My valuable treasures into your temples. 
JOL.4.6	“The children of Judah and of Jerusalem you sold to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own territory. 
JOL.4.7	“Behold, I am rousing them from the place where you sold them, and I will return your retribution on your own head.

JOL.4.14	Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of 
JOL.4.15	The sun and the moon become dark, the stars withdraw their brightness. 
JOL.4.16	 will roar from Zion and give His voice from Jerusalem. Heaven and earth will shudder, but 
JOL.4.17	So you will know that I am 
JOL.4.18	It will be in that day, the mountains will drip sweet wine, the hills will flow with milk, and all the wadis of Judah will flow with water. A spring will flow out from the House of 
JOL.4.19	Egypt will become a desolation and Edom a desert wasteland, because of the violence against the children of Judah, because they shed innocent blood in their land. 
JOL.4.20	But Judah will be inhabited forever— Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
JOL.4.21	I will acquit their bloodguilt that I had not acquitted, for 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds from Tekoa. He perceived these words concerning Israel during the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
AMO.1.2	He said: 
AMO.1.3	Thus says 
AMO.1.4	I will send fire into Hazael’s palace. It will devour Ben-hadad’s citadels. 
AMO.1.5	I will break the Damascus gate-bar and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven, wielding Beth-eden’s scepter. So the people of Aram will go into exile to Kir. 
AMO.1.6	Thus says 
AMO.1.7	So I will send fire on the wall of Gaza —it will devour its citadels. 
AMO.1.8	I will cut off Ashdod’s inhabitant, wielding Ashkelon’s scepter. I will turn My hand against Ekron and the rest of the Philistines will perish. My Lord 
AMO.1.9	Thus says 
AMO.1.10	I will send fire on the wall of Tyre— it will devour its citadels. 
AMO.1.11	Thus says 
AMO.1.12	So I will send fire in Teman— it will devour Bozrah’s citadels. 
AMO.1.13	Thus says 
AMO.1.14	I will kindle fire on Rabbah’s wall and it will devour its citadels, amid shouting on a day of battle, with storm on a day of whirlwind. 
AMO.1.15	Their king will go into exile, he and his princes together. Thus 
AMO.2.1	Thus says 
AMO.2.2	So I will send fire upon Moab— it will devour Kerioth’s citadels. Moab will die in an uproar, with a shout of alarm and the sound of the 
AMO.2.3	I will cut off the ruler from her midst, and slay all her princes with him. Thus 
AMO.2.4	Thus says 
AMO.2.5	So I will send fire upon Judah— it will devour Jerusalem’s citadels.” 
AMO.2.6	Thus says 
AMO.2.7	They trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth and thwart the way of the humble. A man and his father go to the same girl, to profane My holy Name. 
AMO.2.8	Upon garments taken in pledge they stretch out beside every altar, and drink wine confiscated as fines in the house of their gods. 
AMO.2.9	“I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like cedars and as strong as oaks— yes, I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath. 
AMO.2.10	 It was I also who brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness to possess the Amorite’s land. 
AMO.2.11	I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not so, Bnei Yisrael?” declares 
AMO.2.12	“But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and you commanded the prophets saying, ‘Do not prophesy.’ 
AMO.2.13	Behold! I will cause a tottering beneath you as a cart totters when full of sheaves. 
AMO.2.14	Then flight will fail for the swift. The mighty will not strengthen his power, The warrior will not save his life. 
AMO.2.15	The archer will not stand, the fleet-footed will not escape, the horseman will not save himself. 
AMO.2.16	The valiant among the warriors will flee naked in that day.” declares 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that 
AMO.3.2	“Only you have I known from among all the families of the earth. Therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities. 
AMO.3.3	Can two walk together unless they meet by appointment? 
AMO.3.4	Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has taken prey? 
AMO.3.5	Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if it has no bait? Will a snare spring up from the ground without taking anything? 
AMO.3.6	If a 
AMO.3.7	For the Lord 
AMO.3.8	A lion has roared, who will not fear? My Lord 
AMO.3.9	Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and the citadels in the land of Egypt: “Assemble on Samaria’s mountains: Behold the great tumult within it, even the oppression within it.” 
AMO.3.10	They do not know how to be honest, —declares 
AMO.3.11	Therefore thus says my Lord 
AMO.3.12	Thus says 
AMO.3.13	Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob.” It is the declaration of my Lord 
AMO.3.14	“For in a day I shall punish Israel for the transgressions of Israel, and attend to the altars of Bethel— the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 
AMO.3.15	I will also strike the winter house together with the summer house. The houses of ivory will perish, and great houses will be demolished.” It is the declaration of 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on Samaria’s hill, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their masters: “Bring, so we may drink.” 
AMO.4.2	My Lord 
AMO.4.3	You will go out through breaches— each woman straight ahead, and you will be cast to Harmon.” It is the declaration of 
AMO.4.4	“Come to Bethel and transgress, in Gilgal multiply transgression. Every morning bring your sacrifices and your tithes every three days. 
AMO.4.5	Offer up 
AMO.4.6	“So also, I myself have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares 
AMO.4.7	“Also I myself have withheld from you the rain—when three months remain to the harvest, I caused it to rain on one city, while on another city I sent no rain; one piece of ground would get rain, while the portion not rained on would wither. 
AMO.4.8	So two or three cities go staggering to one city to drink water, but would not be satisfied— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares 
AMO.4.9	“I struck you with blight and mildew. Your many gardens and vineyards, your fig-trees and olive trees the locust has devoured— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares 
AMO.4.10	“I sent among you a plague in the manner of Egypt. I slew your young men by the sword, with your chariot-horses in captivity. I made the stench of your camp rise up even to your own nostrils— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares 
AMO.4.11	I overthrew some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You became like a firebrand snatched from a blaze— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore here is what I will do to you, Israel. Because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, Israel!” 
AMO.4.13	For behold! He who forms mountains who creates the wind, who declares His thoughts to man, who makes dawn out of darkness, who walks above the heights of the earth—His Name is 
AMO.5.1	Hear this word that I take up as a lament over you, O house of Israel: 
AMO.5.2	She has fallen, never rising again— virgin Israel— She is forsaken on her land, with nobody to lift her up. 
AMO.5.3	For thus says 
AMO.5.4	For thus says 
AMO.5.5	But do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not cross over to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will come to trouble. 
AMO.5.6	Seek 
AMO.5.7	You who turn justice to wormwood threw righteousness to the ground. 
AMO.5.8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion and changes deep darkness to morning. Who darkens the day into night. Who summons the water of the sea and pours it out on the face of the earth —
AMO.5.9	He flashes destruction on the mighty, so destruction will come against a fortress. 
AMO.5.10	They despise one who reproves at the gate, so they detest one who speaks with integrity. 
AMO.5.11	Therefore, because you trample on the poor, exacting from him a burden of grain, you built houses of hewn stone, but will not dwell in them, you planted pleasant vineyards, but will not drink their wine. 
AMO.5.12	For I know your crimes are many and your sins countless— afflicting the righteous, taking bribes, and turning the needy aside at the gate. 
AMO.5.13	Therefore the prudent keep silent at such a time —for it is a distressful time. 
AMO.5.14	Seek good and not evil, so you may live, and so 
AMO.5.15	Hate evil, love good, maintain justice at the gate. Maybe 
AMO.5.16	Therefore thus said 
AMO.5.17	In all vineyards will be wailing, for I will pass through your midst” —
AMO.5.18	 to you—longing for the Day of 
AMO.5.19	It will be as when a man is fleeing from a lion—and meets a bear! Or he comes home, leans his hand on the wall, and a snake bites him! 
AMO.5.20	Will not the Day of 
AMO.5.21	“I hate, I despise your festivals! I take no delight in your sacred assemblies. 
AMO.5.22	Even if you offer me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them, nor will I look at peace offerings of your fattened animals. 
AMO.5.23	Take away from Me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the melody of your harps. 
AMO.5.24	But let justice roll like water and righteousness like an ever-flowing torrent. 
AMO.5.25	Did you bring sacrifices and offerings to Me in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel? 
AMO.5.26	But you lifted up your images —Siccuth your ‘king’, and Chiun, your star gods— which you made for yourselves, 
AMO.5.27	So I will send you into exile, beyond Damascus.” 
AMO.6.1	 ! You who are at ease in Zion, trusting in Samaria’s hill! Distinguished ones of the foremost of nations— to whom the house of Israel comes 
AMO.6.2	Go over to Calneh and look. From there go to great Hamath, go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Or is their territory larger than yours? 
AMO.6.3	Dismissing the day of calamity, you bring near the throne of violence. 
AMO.6.4	Reclining on beds of ivory, sprawling on their couches, dining on lambs from the flock and calves from amid the stall, 
AMO.6.5	chanting to the sound of harp like David, inventing their own instruments of song, 
AMO.6.6	drinking wine from bowls, anointing with choice ointments— yet they are not sickened over the breakdown of Joseph. 
AMO.6.7	Therefore now they will go into exile at the head of the exiles. Sprawling revelry will cease. 
AMO.6.8	My Lord 
AMO.6.9	If ten people remain in one house, they will die. 
AMO.6.10	One’s beloved—the one burning incense for him—will lift him up to carry the bones out of the house, and he will say to one in the innermost recess of the house: “Is anyone else still with you?” And he will say: “No one.” Then he will say, “Hush! For we must not mention the Name of 
AMO.6.11	For behold, 
AMO.6.12	Will horses run on the cliff? Will one plow there with oxen? Yet you turned justice into venom, the fruit of righteousness into wormwood. 
AMO.6.13	You are rejoicing for no reason, saying: “Haven’t we taken two horns for ourselves by our own strength?” 
AMO.6.14	“For behold, I am raising up against you, O house of Israel, a nation, and they will afflict you from Lebo-Hamath to the Valley of the Arabah.” declares 
AMO.7.1	This is what my Lord 
AMO.7.2	When the locust-swarm had finished devouring the vegetation of the land, I said: “
AMO.7.3	 relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” 
AMO.7.4	This is what my Lord 
AMO.7.5	But I said: “My Lord 
AMO.7.6	 relented concerning this. “This also shall not happen,” says my Lord 
AMO.7.7	This is what He has revealed to me: Behold, my Lord was standing by a vertical wall, and in His hand was a plumb line. 
AMO.7.8	Then 
AMO.7.9	So the high places of Isaac will become desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste, and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” 
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent word to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying: “Amos has been conspiring against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot endure all his words. 
AMO.7.11	For this is what Amos has said: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go captive from his land.’” 
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos: “Seer, go away! Flee back to the land of Judah. Eat bread there, and prophesy there. 
AMO.7.13	But at Bethel you are not to prophesy any more—for it is a royal sanctuary and a house of the kingdom.” 
AMO.7.14	So Amos responded and said to Amaziah: “I am no prophet, nor am I a son of a prophet. Rather, I am a shepherd tending fig trees. 
AMO.7.15	But 
AMO.7.16	So now, hear the word of 
AMO.7.17	Therefore, this is what 
AMO.8.1	This is what my Lord 
AMO.8.2	He said: “Amos, what do you see?” “A basket of summer fruit,” I said. Then 
AMO.8.3	The songs of the palace will become howls in that day.” It is a declaration of my Lord 
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who trample the poor, destroying the afflicted of the land 
AMO.8.5	saying: ‘When will the New Moon be over, so we may sell grain? Or Shabbat, so we may open the wheat market? —Let’s reduce the ephah measure and increase the shekel, cheat with deceitful balances, 
AMO.8.6	buy the poor for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals! We’ll even sell the refuse of the grain!’” 
AMO.8.7	 swore by the Pride of Jacob: “Never will I forget all their deeds! 
AMO.8.8	Will not the land tremble over this? Will not all who dwell in it mourn? Yes, it will rise up like all the Nile —it will surge and sink again like the Nile of Egypt.” 
AMO.8.9	“It will be in that day” —declares my Lord 
AMO.8.10	I will turn your festivals into mourning and all your songs into a dirge. I will pull up sackcloth on every waist and baldness on every head. I will make it like the mourning for an only son— its end a bitter day.” 
AMO.8.11	“Behold, days are coming” —declares my Lord 
AMO.8.12	So people will wander from sea to sea and roam from north to east, searching for the word of 
AMO.8.13	In that day, the fair virgins and the virile young men will faint from thirst. 
AMO.8.14	Those swearing by Samaria’s guilt will say, ‘As your gods live, Dan!’ or ‘As the way of Beersheba lives!’ But they will fall, never to rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw my Lord standing by the altar, and He said: “Strike the tops of the pillars, so the porches shake! Break all of them off at the head! Then the last of them I will slay with the sword— none of them fleeing will escape and no fugitive will slip away. 
AMO.9.2	If they should dig down to 
AMO.9.3	If they should hide themselves at the top of Carmel, I will search them out and take them from there. If they hide themselves from My eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the sea serpent to bite them. 
AMO.9.4	If they should go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword to slay them. I will set My eyes upon them for calamity and not for prosperity.” 
AMO.9.5	My Lord is 
AMO.9.6	He who builds His upper stories in heaven fitted its vault over the earth. He who summons the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth —
AMO.9.7	“Are you not like the children of the Cushites to Me, 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of my Lord 
AMO.9.9	“For behold, I have commanded, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, like grain being tossed in a sieve, without a pebble falling to the ground. 
AMO.9.10	By the sword shall all the sinners of My people die, those who say: ‘The calamity will not overtake or confront us.’ 
AMO.9.11	“In that day I will raise up David’s fallen 
AMO.9.12	—so they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations called by My Name.” It is a declaration of 
AMO.9.13	“Behold, days are soon coming” —it is a declaration of 
AMO.9.14	Yes, I will restore the captivity of My people Israel. They will rebuild desolated cities and dwell in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine. They will also make gardens and eat their fruit. 
AMO.9.15	Yes, I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be plucked up out of their land that I have given to them.” 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus says 
OBA.1.2	Behold, I will make you least among the nations, you will be greatly despised. 
OBA.1.3	The arrogance of your heart has deceived you— living in the clefts of the rock—his dwelling place is lofty, saying in his heart: ‘Who shall bring me down to the earth?’ 
OBA.1.4	Even if you soar like the eagle, and even if you set your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down.’” declares 
OBA.1.5	“If thieves came to you, if robbers by night— how ruined you would be!— would they keep stealing after they had enough? If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning? 
OBA.1.6	How Esau will be ransacked, and how his hidden treasures searched out! 
OBA.1.7	All your allies will force you to the border. The men that are at peace with you will deceive you and overpower you. Those who eat your bread will set a trap under you. (He has no discernment.) 
OBA.1.8	In that day,” —declares 
OBA.1.9	Then your mighty men, O Teman, will be shattered—so everyone will be cut off from the hill country of Esau by slaughter. 
OBA.1.10	“Because of your violence to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever. 
OBA.1.11	On the day that you stood aloof—on the day that strangers carried away his wealth, while foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem— you were just like one of them. 
OBA.1.12	You should not look down on your brother on the day of his disaster, nor should you rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. You should not speak proudly in the day of their distress. 
OBA.1.13	Do not enter the gate of My people in the day of their disaster. Yes, you. Do not gloat over their misery in the day of their disaster. Yes, you— do not loot their wealth in the day of their calamity. 
OBA.1.14	Do not stand at the crossroad to cut down his fugitives, and do not imprison his survivors in the day of distress. 
OBA.1.15	“For the day of 
OBA.1.16	For just as you have drunk on My holy mountain, so all the nations shall drink continually. Yes, they will drink and gulp down, and then be as though they had never existed. 
OBA.1.17	But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance, and it will be holy. Then house of Jacob will dispossess those who dispossessed them. 
OBA.1.18	The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph flame, while the house of Esau will be straw—they will set them on fire and consume them. So there will be no survivors of the house of Esau.” —for 
OBA.1.19	Then those of the Negev will possess the hill country of Esau, and those of the foothills the Philistines. Then they will possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, while Benjamin will possess Gilead. 
OBA.1.20	The exiles of this army of 
OBA.1.21	The victorious will go up on Mount Zion to judge the hill country of Esau. Then the kingdom shall be 
JON.1.1	Now the word of 
JON.1.2	“Rise, go to the great city Nineveh and call out to her, for their evil has risen before me.” 
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish, from the presence of 
JON.1.4	Then 
JON.1.5	So the sailors were afraid and cried out, each man to his own god. Then they cast the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest part of the ship, to lay down and fell fast asleep. 
JON.1.6	So the chief sailor came near to him and said to him, “What, are you sleeping? Get up! Call out to your god. Perhaps the gods will consider us, so we will not perish!” 
JON.1.7	Then each man said to his companion, “Come, let’s cast lots—so we may know because of whom this evil is happening to us.” So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah. 
JON.1.8	Then they said to him, “Tell us, now! On whose account is this evil happening to us? What is your profession and where did you come from? What is your land and from what nation are you?” 
JON.1.9	He said to them, “I am a Hebrew and I fear 
JON.1.10	Then the men became afraid with an overwhelming fear and they said to him, “What have you done?” For the men knew that he had fled from the presence of 
JON.1.11	So they said to him, “What should we do to you so the sea will become calm for us?”—for the storm was raging on. 
JON.1.12	“Pick me up and throw me into the sea,” he said to them, “then the sea will become calm for you. For I know it is because of me that this great storm is upon you.” 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to the land, but they could not, because the sea kept raging against them. 
JON.1.14	So they cried to 
JON.1.15	So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea—and the sea stilled from its raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men became afraid with an overwhelming fear of 
JON.2.1	Now 
JON.2.2	Then Jonah prayed to 
JON.2.3	saying: “From my distress I cried to 
JON.2.4	For you hurled me from the deep into the heart of the seas, and currents swirled around me. All your waves and your breakers swept over me.” 
JON.2.5	And I said, “I have been banished from before your eyes. Yet I will continue to look toward your holy Temple.” 
JON.2.6	Waters surrounded me up to my soul. The deep sea engulfed me— reeds clung to my head. 
JON.2.7	To the bottoms of the mountains I went down. The earth with her bars was around me, forever! Yet You brought my life up from the Pit, 
JON.2.8	As my soul was fading from me, I remembered 
JON.2.9	Those who watch worthless empty things forsake their mercy. 
JON.2.10	But I, with a voice of thanks will sacrifice to you. What I vowed, I will pay. Salvation is from 
JON.2.11	Then 
JON.3.1	Now the word of 
JON.3.2	“Rise and go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry out to it the proclamation that I am telling you.” 
JON.3.3	So Jonah rose and went to Nineveh according to the word of 
JON.3.4	So Jonah began to come into the city for one day’s journey, and he cried out saying: “Another forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown!” 
JON.3.5	Then the people of Nineveh believed God and called for a fast and wore sackcloth—from the greatest of them to the least of them. 
JON.3.6	When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, covered himself in sackcloth, and sat in the ashes. 
JON.3.7	He made a proclamation saying: “In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles, no man or beast, herd or flock, may taste anything. They must not graze nor drink water. 
JON.3.8	But cover man and beast with sackcloth. Let them cry out to God with urgency. Let each one turn from his evil way and from the violence in his hands. 
JON.3.9	Who knows? God may turn and relent, and turn back from his burning anger, so that we may not perish.” 
JON.3.10	When God saw their deeds—that they turned from their wicked ways—God relented from the calamity that He said He would do to them, and did not do it.
JON.4.1	But it greatly displeased Jonah and he resented it. 
JON.4.2	So he prayed to 
JON.4.3	So please, 
JON.4.4	Yet 
JON.4.5	So Jonah went out from the city and sat east of the city. There He made a 
JON.4.6	Then 
JON.4.7	But God at dawn the next day prepared a worm that crippled the plant and it withered away. 
JON.4.8	When the sun rose, God prepared a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he became faint. So he implored that his soul would die, saying, “My death would be better than my life!” 
JON.4.9	Then God said to Jonah, “Is it good for you to be so angry about the plant?” “It is,” he said, “I am angry enough to die!” 
JON.4.10	But 
MIC.1.1	The word of 
MIC.1.2	Hear, O peoples—all of you! Attention, O land and everything in it! 
MIC.1.3	For behold, 
MIC.1.4	The mountains will melt away under Him and the valleys will split apart like wax before the fire, like water being poured down a slope. 
MIC.1.5	All this is because of Jacob’s transgression and the sins of the house of Israel. Who is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? Who are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem? 
MIC.1.6	So I will make Samaria into a ruin in the countryside, planting places for a vineyard. I will hurl her stones into the valley and will lay bare her foundations. 
MIC.1.7	All her images will be smashed, all her prostitute’s pay burned with fire, and all her idols I will make desolate. For from prostitute’s pay she collected them and to prostitute’s pay they will return. 
MIC.1.8	Concerning this let me lament and howl. Let me walk barefoot and naked. I will make a howl like jackals and a mourning like ostriches. 
MIC.1.9	For her wounds are incurable. For it has come up to Judah. It has reached the gate of my people— even up to Jerusalem! 
MIC.1.10	Tell it not in Gath—weep not at all. At Beth-le-aphrah roll in the dust. 
MIC.1.11	Pass on, you who dwell in Saphir— nakedness and shame— she who dwells in Zaanan will not come out. Wailing of Beth-ezel: He will take from you its standing-place. 
MIC.1.12	For she who dwells in Maroth has languished for something good. For calamity has come down from 
MIC.1.13	Harness the chariot to the steed, O inhabitant of Lachish! It was the beginning of sin for the Daughter of Zion— because in you were found the rebellions of Israel. 
MIC.1.14	Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath—houses of Achzib as a deception to the kings of Israel. 
MIC.1.15	Yet I will bring the possessor to you, inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will come as far as Adullam. 
MIC.1.16	Shave yourself bald, yes shear your hair for the children of your delight. Enlarge your bald spot like a vulture, for they went from you into exile.
MIC.2.1	 to them who scheme wickedness, who work out evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning, they do it, for the power is in their hands. 
MIC.2.2	They covet fields, so they seize them, or houses, and take them away. So they oppress a man and his house— a man and his inheritance. 
MIC.2.3	Therefore, thus said 
MIC.2.4	In that day He will lift up a parable for you, and there will be wailing lamentation, saying: “We have been utterly ruined! He changes the portion of my people. How He removes it from me! To the faithless He apportions our fields!” 
MIC.2.5	Therefore you will have no one casting for territory by lot in the congregation of 
MIC.2.6	“Do not prophesy,” they prophesy. Unless they prophesy about such things, He will not turn back reproaches.” 
MIC.2.7	Is it said, “O house of Jacob, is the 
MIC.2.8	But recently My people arose as an enemy. You strip off the outer robe of a garment from those passing through confidently— those returning from war. 
MIC.2.9	The wives of My people you cast out from their exquisite houses. From her young children you take away My splendor, forever. 
MIC.2.10	Arise and go! For this is not the resting place, because of uncleanness that destroys— a grievous destruction. 
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood speaks lies—“I will prophesy for you of wine and strong drink”—then he would be a spokesman of this people. 
MIC.2.12	“I will surely gather Jacob—all of you! I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock within its pasture. They will be noisy with people. 
MIC.2.13	One breaking through will go up before them. They will break through, pass through the gate and go out by it. Their King will pass through before them —
MIC.3.1	Then I said: “Hear, leaders of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice? 
MIC.3.2	You haters of good and lovers of evil, you are robbing their skin from them and their flesh from their bones.” 
MIC.3.3	Now that they have eaten the flesh of my people, stripped their skin off from them, and smashed their bones to bits, they cut it up like flesh in a pot, or like meat within a caldron. 
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry out to 
MIC.3.5	Thus said 
MIC.3.6	“Therefore you will have night without vision, and darkness without divination. The sun shall set on the prophets, the day shall become dark upon them.” 
MIC.3.7	So the seers will be ashamed and the diviners will be abashed. Indeed all of them will cover their lips, for there will be no answer from God. 
MIC.3.8	Nevertheless I myself am filled with power— with the 
MIC.3.9	Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel: You who abhor justice, and twist everything upright, 
MIC.3.10	who build up Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with injustice. 
MIC.3.11	Her leaders give judgment for a bribe. Her priests give direction for a price. Her prophets practice divination for money. Yet they lean on 
MIC.3.12	Therefore, because of you Zion will become a plowed field. Yes, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the Temple Mount will become a high place in a forest. 
MIC.4.1	But at the end of days the mountain of 
MIC.4.2	Then many nations will go and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of 
MIC.4.3	He will judge between many peoples and decide for mighty nations far off. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war again. 
MIC.4.4	But each man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree, with no one causing terror, for the mouth of 
MIC.4.5	Though all the peoples will walk each in the name of his god, so we ourselves will walk in the Name of 
MIC.4.6	“In that day” —it is a declaration of 
MIC.4.7	I will make her who was limping into a remnant, and her who was banished a mighty nation. 
MIC.4.8	But you, watchtower of the flock, are the hill of the Daughter of Zion. To you she will come. Even the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the Daughter of Jerusalem. 
MIC.4.9	Why are you crying out aloud now? Is there no King within you? Has your counselor perished, so that agony has gripped you like birth pangs? 
MIC.4.10	Writhe and give birth, Daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor. For now you will go forth from a city. You will dwell in the field, and you will come as far as Babylon. There you will be rescued. There will 
MIC.4.11	But now many nations have assembled against you, those who are saying, “Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze on Zion.” 
MIC.4.12	But they do not know 
MIC.4.13	Arise and tread, Daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves bronze. You will thresh many peoples. I will devote their unjust gain to 
MIC.4.14	Now gather yourself in troops, O Daughter of Troops. He has laid siege against us. With a staff they have struck the Judge of Israel on the cheek.
MIC.5.1	But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah— least among the clans of Judah— from you will come out to Me One to be ruler in Israel, One whose goings forth are from of old, from days of eternity. 
MIC.5.2	Therefore He will give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth. Then the remnant of His brothers will return to 
MIC.5.3	So He will arise and tend His flock with the strength of 
MIC.5.4	This One will be 
MIC.5.5	They will devastate the land of Assyria with the sword— even Nimrod’s land with a drawn blade. He will deliver us from Assyria, when he invades our land, when he tramples on our territory. 
MIC.5.6	Now the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples, like dew from 
MIC.5.7	For the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the forest beasts, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, who, if he passed through, would trample and tear to pieces, and there would be no deliverer. 
MIC.5.8	May your hand be raised up against your adversaries, and may all your foes be cut off. 
MIC.5.9	“Now in that day” —it is a declaration of 
MIC.5.10	I will cut off the cities of your land, and throw down all your strongholds. 
MIC.5.11	I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you will have no more diviners. 
MIC.5.12	I will cut off your carved images and your sacred pillars from among you, so you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands. 
MIC.5.13	I will uproot your Asherah poles from among you, and destroy your cities. 
MIC.5.14	So I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not listened. 
MIC.6.1	Hear what 
MIC.6.2	Hear, 
MIC.6.3	O My people, what have I done to you? Or how have I wearied you? Answer Me! 
MIC.6.4	When I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
MIC.6.5	O My people, remember, please: What did Balak, king of Moab, propose? What did Balaam son of Beor answer him? From Shittim as far as Gilgal, so that you might acknowledge the righteous acts of 
MIC.6.6	With what shall I come before 
MIC.6.7	Will 
MIC.6.8	He has told you, humanity, what is good, and what 
MIC.6.9	The voice of 
MIC.6.10	Does the house of the wicked still have treasures of wickedness? Or is an undersized ephah denounced? 
MIC.6.11	Can I be pure with wicked balances? Or with a bag of deceptive weights? 
MIC.6.12	For the rich of the city are full of violence and its inhabitants speak lies. Their tongue in their mouth is deceit. 
MIC.6.13	So also I will strike you severely, desolating you because of your sins. 
MIC.6.14	You will eat but not be satisfied, and emptiness will be within you. You will try to escape, but you will not reach safety. Whatever you make safe, I will give to the sword. 
MIC.6.15	You will sow but not reap; You will tread olives but not anoint yourself with oil, and grapes but not drink wine. 
MIC.6.16	Now, you observe the statutes of Omri and every practice of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their counsels. Therefore I will make you a horror, and her inhabitants a hissing, so you will bear the scorn of My people.
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! For I am like gatherings of produce in summer, like gleanings of a vineyard. There is no cluster to eat, no first-ripe fig that I crave. 
MIC.7.2	The pious have perished from the land, there is none upright among mankind. All of them lie in wait for blood. A man hunts his brother with a net. 
MIC.7.3	Both hands are diligent at doing evil. The official and the judge ask for a bribe. The distinguished man utters a desire of his soul. Thus they weave it together. 
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a prickly bush, the most upright like a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen— of your visitation—is coming. Then their confusion will occur. 
MIC.7.5	Do not trust in a friend. Do not trust in a close companion. Guard the openings of your mouth from her who lies on your breast. 
MIC.7.6	For son treats father with contempt; daughter rises up against mother; daughter-in-law against mother-in-law: a man’s enemies are the people of his own house.
MIC.7.7	But I—I will watch for 
MIC.7.8	Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. Though I have fallen—I will arise. Though I sit in darkness, 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of 
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her— she who said to me: “Where is 
MIC.7.11	A day to rebuild your walls— a day the boundary will be far off, 
MIC.7.12	a day when they will come to you from Assyria to the cities of Egypt, from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. 
MIC.7.13	Yet the land will become a wasteland because of her inhabitants, because of the fruit of their misdeeds. 
MIC.7.14	Tend Your people with Your staff, the flock of Your inheritance, dwelling alone, in a forest in the midst of a fertile garden. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
MIC.7.15	As in the days of your coming out from the land of Egypt I will show him wonders. 
MIC.7.16	Nations will see and be put to shame despite all their might. They will put a hand on their mouth, their ears will be deaf. 
MIC.7.17	They will lick dust like a snake. Like crawling things of the land, they will come trembling out of their hiding places. To 
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like You pardoning iniquity, overlooking transgression, for the remnant of His heritage? He will not retain His anger forever, because He delights in mercy. 
MIC.7.19	He will again have compassion on us. He will subdue our iniquities, and You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. 
MIC.7.20	You will extend truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, that You swore to our ancestors from the days of old.
NAM.1.1	The oracle concerning Nineveh—the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
NAM.1.2	A jealous and avenging God is 
NAM.1.3	 is slow to anger and great in power, but He will by no means acquit the guilty. 
NAM.1.4	Rebuking the sea, He made it dry, as He has dried up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel languished, Yes, Lebanon’s budding languished. 
NAM.1.5	Mountains quaked because of Him, and the hills have melted. The earth has heaved up at His presence—yes, the world and everything dwelling in it. 
NAM.1.6	Before His indignation who can stand? Who can withstand His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and cliffs break down before Him. 
NAM.1.7	 is good as a refuge in the day of distress, and He knows those who take refuge in Him. 
NAM.1.8	But with an overwhelming flood, He will make that place a total ruin. Darkness will pursue His enemies. 
NAM.1.9	What can you scheme against 
NAM.1.10	For even like tangled thorns they will be consumed, or like drunkards who are drunk, or like stubble that is fully dry. 
NAM.1.11	Out of you has come a schemer of evil against 
NAM.1.12	Thus said 
NAM.1.13	I will now break his yoke from you, and tear apart your bonds. 
NAM.1.14	 has issued a command against you: no more will your name be spread. From the house of your gods I will cut off the idol and metal image. I will prepare your grave— for you have become worthless.
NAM.2.1	Behold, upon the mountains are the feet of him bringing good news, proclaiming 
NAM.2.2	A shatterer has come up against you. Guard the rampart! Watch the way! 
NAM.2.3	For 
NAM.2.4	He makes the shield of warriors’ red— valiant men are clad in scarlet! the chariot burns with metal fire on the day of his preparation, The fir trees are shaken. 
NAM.2.5	The chariots dash madly about through the streets, rushing to and fro in the plazas, their appearance is like torches, darting like flashes of lightning. 
NAM.2.6	He will recall his majestic ones. They will stumble in their march. They will hasten to her wall. Now the siege work is set up. 
NAM.2.7	The river gates will be opened, and the palace will melt away. 
NAM.2.8	What was erected will be exiled and carried away. Her handmaids are lamenting like the sound of doves, beating their breasts. 
NAM.2.9	Nineveh was like a pool of water for days—now they are fleeing. Stop, stop! Yet no one turns back. 
NAM.2.10	Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no end of treasure— glory from everything precious. 
NAM.2.11	Emptiness, desolation, waste! Heart melting, knees buckling, anguish in all the loins, all their faces grown pale! 
NAM.2.12	Where is the lions’ den, the feeding place for young lions— where the lion went for a lion’s cub— with nothing to disturb them? 
NAM.2.13	The lion rips enough for his cubs, strangles prey for his lionesses. Yes, he fills his den with prey, his lair with torn flesh. 
NAM.2.14	“Here I am against you” —it is a declaration of

NAM.3.2	crack of whip, rattling of wheels, horse galloping, chariot jolting, 
NAM.3.3	horseman climbing up, blade of sword and flash of spear, Many slain, a mass of corpses —no end to the corpses— they stumble over their corpses!
NAM.3.4	Because of the many fornications of the elegant prostitute, the mistress of sorceries, who sells nations by her fornications, and clans through her sorceries— 
NAM.3.5	Behold, I am against you —it is a declaration of 
NAM.3.6	Yes, I will fling filth on you. I will treat you with contempt and set you up as a spectacle. 
NAM.3.7	So it will be that all who see you will recoil from you and say, “Nineveh has been ravaged! Who will lament for her?” Where will I find comforters for you? 
NAM.3.8	Are you better than No-amon, situated among channels of the Nile, water surrounding her, whose fortress and wall was water ? 
NAM.3.9	Cush and Egypt were her might—unlimited. Put and Libya were her allies. 
NAM.3.10	Yet she went off to exile among the captives. Even her babes were dashed to pieces at the head of all streets. They cast lots for her dignitaries, and all her great men were bound with chains. 
NAM.3.11	You too will become drunk. You will hide yourself. You too will seek refuge from an enemy. 
NAM.3.12	All your fortifications will be fig trees with firstfruits— when shaken, they will fall, into an eater’s mouth. 
NAM.3.13	See, your people within you are women. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies— fire has devoured your gate-bars. 
NAM.3.14	Draw water for a siege. Strengthen your fortifications! Go into the mud and tread mortar. Take hold of the brick mold. 
NAM.3.15	There fire will devour you. Sword will cut you off, devouring you like the locust. Multiply like the locust. Multiply like the swarming locust! 
NAM.3.16	You have multiplied your traders more than the stars of heaven. Locusts have stripped and flown off. 
NAM.3.17	Your princes are like locusts, your officials like a locust swarm, camping in the walls on a chilly day. The sun rises, and they are chased away, and where they are is unknown. 
NAM.3.18	Your shepherds have become drowsy, king of Assyria, your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the hills, with no one to gather them.

HAB.1.1	The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw. 
HAB.1.2	How long, 
HAB.1.3	Why do You show me wickedness, and why must I behold mischief? Yes, devastation and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention arises. 
HAB.1.4	Therefore, 
HAB.1.5	“Look among the nations! Observe! Astonish yourself! Be astounded! For a work is being done in your days. You will not believe it if it were told.

HAB.1.7	Dreadful and terrifying, Its justice and dignity derive from itself. 
HAB.1.8	Its horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Its horsemen come galloping. Its horsemen are coming from afar. They fly like a vulture, swooping down to eat. 
HAB.1.9	All of them come for violence— an assembling of faces to the east. He gathers captives like sand. 
HAB.1.10	He scoffs at kings, and rulers are a joke to him. He laughs at every stronghold— he heaps up dirt and takes it. 
HAB.1.11	Then a wind sweeps through and passes on. He is guilty— This, his strength, is his god.”
HAB.1.12	Are not You from antiquity— 
HAB.1.13	With eyes too pure to see evil You cannot look at such trouble! Why do You look at the treacherous? Why do You remain silent when a wicked one swallows up those more righteous than him? 
HAB.1.14	You made man like the fish of the sea, like a creeping thing— with no one ruling over him. 
HAB.1.15	He brings up all with hook in jaw, drags away in his dragnet, or gathers with his fishing-net. Therefore he rejoices with glee. 
HAB.1.16	Therefore he sacrifices to his dragnet, and offers incense to his fishing-net. For through them his portion is rich and his food abundant. 
HAB.1.17	Will he empty his net for this reason —continually slaying nations— with no compassion?
HAB.2.1	I will take my stand at my post, and station myself on the rampart, and I will watch to see what He will say to me, and what I will answer regarding my argument.
HAB.2.2	Then 
HAB.2.3	For the vision is yet for an appointed time. It hastens to the end and will not fail. If it should be slow in coming, wait for it, For it will surely come—it will not delay.”

HAB.2.5	Indeed, because this wine betrays, a proud man never rests. He enlarges his desire like 
HAB.2.6	Will not all take up a proverb against him or a scornful riddle about him? “
HAB.2.7	Will biting you arise suddenly, and those shaking you awaken, as you will become plunder for them? 
HAB.2.8	Since you looted many nations, all the survivors will plunder you— because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, the city and all its inhabitants. 
HAB.2.9	 to one surely getting unjust gain for his house— to set his nest on high, to escape the reach of calamity! 
HAB.2.10	You schemed shame for your house, by cutting off many peoples, so going wrong yourself. 
HAB.2.11	For a stone will cry out from a wall, and wooden beams will answer. 
HAB.2.12	 to him who builds a city by bloodshed, and establishes a town with injustice!

HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, as a passionate song. 
HAB.3.2	, I have heard the report about You and I have come to fear. 
HAB.3.3	God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His majesty covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth. 
HAB.3.4	With brilliance like light, rays emanate from His hand. There His power was hidden. 
HAB.3.5	Pestilence goes before Him, a fiery bolt goes forth at His feet. 
HAB.3.6	He stood, and the earth shook. He looked, and startled nations. Ancient mountains were shattered, hills of antiquity sank down. His ways are everlasting. 
HAB.3.7	I saw tents of Cushan under calamity. The curtains of the land of Midian are trembling. 
HAB.3.8	, is your wrath against rivers? Or Your anger at the rivers? Or is Your fury with the sea? For You ride on Your horses, Your chariots of salvation! 
HAB.3.9	Your bow is laid bare. Sworn are rods—a decree. Selah You cleave the land with rivers. 
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw You and writhe. A downpour of water overflows. The deep gives its voice— it lifts up hands high. 
HAB.3.11	Sun and moon, stand in lofty abode. At the flash of Your arrows they go, at the radiance of the lightning of Your spear. 
HAB.3.12	With indignation You pace the land. With anger You thresh nations. 
HAB.3.13	You went out for the salvation of Your people—for the deliverance of Your anointed one. You shatter the head of the house of the wicked—to lay it bare from foundation up to the top. Selah 
HAB.3.14	You have pierced his chief rulers with his own staff— They stormed in to scatter me. Their exultation is like devouring the weak in secret. 
HAB.3.15	You marched forth, Your horses in the sea— much water foaming. 
HAB.3.16	I heard, and my belly trembled. My lips quivered at the sound. Decay comes into my bones. I tremble where I stand, since I must wait quietly for a day of distress to come up against the people who will invade us. 
HAB.3.17	Though the fig tree does not blossom, and there is no yield on the vines, Though the olive crop fail, and the fields produce no food, the flock is cut off from the fold, and there is no cattle in the stalls. 
HAB.3.18	Yet will I triumph in 
HAB.3.19	 my Lord, is my strength. He has made my feet like a deer’s, and will make me walk on my high places. For the choir director: On my stringed instruments. 
ZEP.1.1	The word of 
ZEP.1.2	I will totally sweep away everything from the face of the earth, declares 
ZEP.1.3	I will sweep away man and beast, I will sweep away the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea— also the stumbling blocks—the wicked. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth, declares 
ZEP.1.4	“I will stretch out my hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place —the names of the idolatrous priests along with the 
ZEP.1.5	those bowing down on the roofs to the host of the heavens. those bowing down, swearing to 
ZEP.1.6	those turning from following 
ZEP.1.7	Be silent before 
ZEP.1.8	On the day of 
ZEP.1.9	In that day I will punish all who skip over the threshold while filling their master’s House with violence and deceit. 
ZEP.1.10	In that day—declares 
ZEP.1.11	Howl, inhabitants of Maktesh! For all the people of Canaan are destroyed. All who weigh out silver are cut off. 
ZEP.1.12	At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men whose spirits have hardened, who say in their hearts, ‘
ZEP.1.13	Their wealth will become plunder, their houses a ruin. They will build houses but not live in them. They will plant vineyards but not drink their wine. 
ZEP.1.14	The great day of 
ZEP.1.15	That day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress, a day of devastating storm and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness, 
ZEP.1.16	a day of 
ZEP.1.17	I will bring such distress upon mankind that they will walk like the blind— for they have sinned against 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to rescue them on the day of 
ZEP.2.1	Gather together! Gather together, O shameless nation— 
ZEP.2.2	before the decree is brought forth, before the day passes away like chaff, before

ZEP.2.5	 to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of Cherethites! The word of 
ZEP.2.6	The seacoast will become pastures, with meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks. 
ZEP.2.7	The coast will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah, upon which they will graze. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening. For 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the taunts of Moab and the jeers of the children of Ammon, who taunted My people and expanded on their border. 
ZEP.2.9	Therefore, as I live, declares 
ZEP.2.10	This is what they will get for their pride, for they have taunted and expanded against the people of

ZEP.2.12	You Ethiopians too will be slain by My sword. 
ZEP.2.13	He will stretch out his hand against the north and devastate Assyria and make Nineveh as a wasteland— dry as a desert. 
ZEP.2.14	Flocks will lie down in her midst, all kinds of beasts— both the little owl and the great owl will lodge in her pillars. A voice will hoot in the window. Ruin will be in the doorway, for the cedar beams will be exposed. 
ZEP.2.15	This is the exultant city, dwelling securely, saying in her heart, ‘It’s me--no one else but me!’ How did she become a ruin, an abode for wild beasts? Everyone who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist. 
ZEP.3.1	 to the oppressive city— filthy and defiled! 
ZEP.3.2	She did not obey; she took no correction. She did not trust in 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are wolves of the night, leaving nothing but bones for morning. 
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men. Her 
ZEP.3.5	 is righteous in her midst. He will do no injustice. Morning by morning He brings His justice to light. He does not fail. Yet the unjust knows no shame. 
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off nations. Their towers have become desolate. I have destroyed their streets. with no one passing by. Their cities are laid waste, with no one—none living there. 
ZEP.3.7	I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me, you will accept correction, so her dwelling place would not be cut off— all that I appointed against her.’ But they arose early and made all their deeds corrupt. 
ZEP.3.8	Therefore, wait for me, declares 
ZEP.3.9	For then I will restore to the people pure speech, so that all of them may call upon the Name of 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, My worshipers, the daughter of My scattered ones will bring My offering. 
ZEP.3.11	On that day you will not be ashamed because of all your deeds by which you rebelled against Me. For then I will remove from your midst your proud, arrogant ones, and you will never again be haughty on My holy mountain. 
ZEP.3.12	But I will leave among you a people meek and humble. They will take refuge in the Name of 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel will do no injustice nor will they tell lies, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. For they will graze and lie down and no one will make them afraid. 
ZEP.3.14	Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel! Rejoice and exult wholeheartedly, O daughter of Jerusalem! 
ZEP.3.15	 has taken away your punishments. He has turned back your adversary. The King of Israel, 
ZEP.3.16	On that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, ‘Have no fear, O Zion, do not let your hands fall limp. 
ZEP.3.17	 your God is in your midst— a mighty Savior! He will delight over you with joy. He will quiet you with His love. He will dance for joy over you with singing.’ 
ZEP.3.18	“I will gather those among you who grieve over your 
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the outcast. I will make them a praise and a name throughout all the land where they suffered shame. 
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will bring you in. At that time I will gather you. For I will give you renown and glory among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your captives before your eyes,” declares 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of 
HAG.1.2	“Thus says 
HAG.1.3	Then the word of 
HAG.1.4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this House lies in ruins? 
HAG.1.5	But now,” thus says 
HAG.1.6	You sowed much but bring in little. You eat but are never satisfied. You drink but not enough to get filled. You put on clothes but no one is warm. And whoever earns wages works for a bag full of holes.” 
HAG.1.7	Thus says 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the hills, bring wood and build the House. Then I will delight in it and I will be glorified,” says 
HAG.1.9	“You have looked for much, but indeed, there is little. What you have brought home, I have blown away. Why is this?”—it is a declaration of 
HAG.1.10	Therefore, because of you, the sky has withheld dew and the earth has withheld its yield. 
HAG.1.11	For I have called for drought on the land, the hills and the grain, on the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on mankind and beast, as well as all labor of hands.” 
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak, 
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the messenger of 
HAG.1.14	Then 
HAG.1.15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
HAG.2.1	On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of 
HAG.2.2	Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, 
HAG.2.3	“Who remains among you who saw this House in its former glory? So how do you see it now? Does it not seem as nothing in comparison in your eyes? 
HAG.2.4	But now, Zerubbabel, 
HAG.2.5	“According to the word I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. My 
HAG.2.6	For thus says 
HAG.2.7	and I will shake all the nations. The treasures of all the nations will come, and I will fill this House with glory,” says 
HAG.2.8	“The silver is mine and the gold is mine!”—it is a declaration of 
HAG.2.9	“The glory of this latter House will be greater than the former,” says 
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of 
HAG.2.11	“Thus says 
HAG.2.12	If a person carries consecrated meat in the corner of his garment, and with his corner he touches bread, stew, wine, oil or any food, will it become holy too?’” Then the 
HAG.2.13	So Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become unclean?” The 
HAG.2.14	Then, Haggai answered and said, “So it is with this people. So is this nation before Me”—it is a declaration of 
HAG.2.15	But now, set your heart back from this day onward. Before stone was set upon stone in the Temple of 
HAG.2.16	how were things? When one came to a grain-heap of twenty measures, there were ten; when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were twenty. 
HAG.2.17	I struck you with blight and with mildew and with hail—every work of your hands—so you were nothing to Me”—it is a declaration of 
HAG.2.18	“Now, set your heart back from this day on—from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day the Temple of 
HAG.2.19	Is there still seed in the storehouse? Also the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree—are they still bearing fruit? From this day on I am going to bless you.” 
HAG.2.20	Then the word of 
HAG.2.21	“Say to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, 
HAG.2.22	and I will overturn the throne of kingdoms and destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overturn the chariot and its rider, so horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother. 
HAG.2.23	“On that day’”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of 
ZEC.1.2	“
ZEC.1.3	Therefore tell them, thus says 
ZEC.1.4	Do not be like your fathers to whom the former prophets cried out saying, thus says 
ZEC.1.5	“Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
ZEC.1.6	But My words and My decrees, which I commanded My servants the prophets—did they not overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said ‘As He determined, 
ZEC.1.7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shevat, in the second year of Darius, the word of 
ZEC.1.8	“In the night I saw, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse was standing among the myrtle trees that were in the ravine. Behind him were red, sorrel and white horses. 
ZEC.1.9	Then I asked, ‘What are these, my lord?’ Now the angel speaking with me said to me, ‘I will show you what these are.’ 
ZEC.1.10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, ‘These are the ones 
ZEC.1.11	They answered the angel of 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of 
ZEC.1.13	 answered the angel who was speaking to me with pleasant, comforting words. 
ZEC.1.14	Then the angel speaking to me said, ‘Cry out saying, thus says 
ZEC.1.15	and I am infuriated with the haughty nations. I was a little angry with them, but they furthered their own calamity.” 
ZEC.1.16	“Therefore,” thus says 
ZEC.1.17	Again cry out, saying, thus says 
ZEC.2.1	Then I lifted up my eyes and behold, I saw four horns! 
ZEC.2.2	I said to the angel speaking with me, ‘What are these?’ He said to me, ‘These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.’ 
ZEC.2.3	Then 
ZEC.2.4	I asked, ‘What are these coming to do?’ He answered, ‘These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one could raise his head, but the craftsmen have come to frighten them, to cast down the horns of the nations that have lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.’ 
ZEC.2.5	I lifted up my eyes—and behold, I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.6	I asked, ‘Where are you going?’ He answered me, ‘To measure Jerusalem to see how wide and how long it is.’ 
ZEC.2.7	Then behold, the angel speaking with me left and another angel went out to meet him, 
ZEC.2.8	saying to him, ‘Run, speak to this young man saying: “Jerusalem will be inhabited as a village without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in it. 
ZEC.2.9	For I”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.2.10	 , oy! Flee from the land of the north”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.2.11	“
ZEC.2.12	“For thus says 
ZEC.2.13	‘For behold, I will shake My hand against them and they will be plunder to their servants.’ Then you will know that 
ZEC.2.14	“‘Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For behold, I am coming and I will live among you’—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.2.15	‘In that day many nations will join themselves to 
ZEC.2.16	 will inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land and will once again choose Jerusalem. 
ZEC.2.17	Be silent before 
ZEC.3.1	Then he showed me Joshua the 
ZEC.3.2	 said to the satan, ‘
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was wearing filthy garments and standing before the angel 
ZEC.3.4	who answered and spoke to those standing before him saying, ‘Remove the filthy garments from him.’ Then to Joshua he said, ‘See, I have removed your iniquity from you and will dress you with fine clothing.’ 
ZEC.3.5	Then I said, ‘Place a clean turban on his head.’ So they put a pure turban on his head and clothed him with garments while the angel of 
ZEC.3.6	The angel of 
ZEC.3.7	‘Thus says 
ZEC.3.8	Listen well, Joshua 
ZEC.3.9	For behold! The stone I have laid before Joshua is one stone with seven facets. On it I will engrave an inscription,” declares 
ZEC.3.10	In that day,” declares 
ZEC.4.1	Then the angel who had been speaking with me returned and woke me—like a man who is wakened from his sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	He asked me, ‘What do you see?’ I replied, ‘Behold, I see a solid gold 
ZEC.4.3	Also two olive trees are by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side of it.’ 
ZEC.4.4	Then I responded by saying to the angel speaking with me, ‘What are these, my lord?’ 
ZEC.4.5	The angel who spoke with me responded by asking me, ‘You do not know what these are?’ I replied, ‘No, my lord.’ 
ZEC.4.6	Then he responded to me by saying, ‘This is the word of 
ZEC.4.7	“What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. He will bring out the capstone with shouts of “Grace, grace” to it.’” 
ZEC.4.8	Again the word of 
ZEC.4.9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this House. His hands will also finish it. Then you will know that 
ZEC.4.10	For who despises the day of small things? These seven—which are the eyes of 
ZEC.4.11	Then I responded by asking him, “What are these two olive trees, on the right and on the left of the 
ZEC.4.12	Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two golden pipes that empty the golden oil out of them?” 
ZEC.4.13	He said to me, “You do not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” 
ZEC.4.14	So he said, “These are the two anointed ones, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.”
ZEC.5.1	Once again I lifted up my eyes and behold, I saw a flying scroll! 
ZEC.5.2	Then the angel asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a flying scroll twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.” 
ZEC.5.3	He said to me: “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land: everyone who steals will be swept away from here according to it, and everyone who swears will be swept away from here according to it.” 
ZEC.5.4	“I will send it out”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel speaking with me came forward, and said to me, “Now lift up your eyes and see what is appearing.” 
ZEC.5.6	I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “This is the measuring basket that goes out.” He continued, “This is their eye in all the land.” 
ZEC.5.7	Then behold, a lead cover was lifted and a woman was sitting in the middle of the measuring basket. 
ZEC.5.8	The angel exclaimed, ‘This is Wickedness!’ Then he shoved her back inside the measuring basket, throwing the lead weight over its mouth. 
ZEC.5.9	After this I lifted up my eyes and behold, I saw two women emerging with the wind in their wings (they had wings like the wings of a stork) and they raised the measuring basket between the earth and the heaven. 
ZEC.5.10	I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the measuring basket?” 
ZEC.5.11	He said, “To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will live there in her own place.”
ZEC.6.1	Again I lifted up my eyes, and behold, I saw four chariots emerging from between the two mountains—mountains of bronze! 
ZEC.6.2	The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot black horses, 
ZEC.6.3	the third chariot white horses and the fourth chariot had strong dapple horses. 
ZEC.6.4	Then I responded by saying to the angel speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
ZEC.6.5	The angel answered me saying, “These are the four winds of heaven that go forth from the presence of the Lord of all the earth. 
ZEC.6.6	The chariot with the black horses is going to the land of the north and the white ones have gone out after them, but the dappled ones have gone out to the land of the south.” 
ZEC.6.7	When the strong ones went out, they requested to go to walk throughout the earth. He said, “Go! Walk throughout the earth.” So they walked throughout the earth.” 
ZEC.6.8	Then he called and spoke to me saying, ‘Look! Those going toward the land of the north have given rest to My 
ZEC.6.9	And the word of 
ZEC.6.10	‘Take from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon, and go the same day, go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah! 
ZEC.6.11	Take silver and gold, make crowns and set on the head of Joshua son of Johozadak, the 
ZEC.6.12	Then speak to him saying, “Thus says 
ZEC.6.13	He will build the Temple of 
ZEC.6.14	The crowns will be in the Temple of 
ZEC.6.15	Those who are far off will come and build in the Temple of 
ZEC.7.1	In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of 
ZEC.7.2	Now Bethel sent Sarezer and Regem-melech together with his men to seek the favor of 
ZEC.7.3	and to speak to the 
ZEC.7.4	Then the word of 
ZEC.7.5	“Speak to all the people of the land and to the 
ZEC.7.6	When you eat and drink, are you not eating and drinking for yourself? 
ZEC.7.7	Are not these the words that 
ZEC.7.8	Again the word of 
ZEC.7.9	“Thus says 
ZEC.7.10	Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the outsider or the poor. Furthermore, do not let any of you devise evil against one another in your heart.’ 
ZEC.7.11	“But they refused to pay attention. They stubbornly turned their backs and stopped their ears from hearing. 
ZEC.7.12	Indeed, they made their hearts as hard as flint preventing them from hearing the 
ZEC.7.13	It came about that just as He called and they did not listen, so they would call and I would not listen,” says 
ZEC.7.14	‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations they have not known. Thus the land was left so desolate behind them that no one passed through or returned, for they made the pleasant land desolate.’”
ZEC.8.1	Then the word of 
ZEC.8.2	“Thus says 
ZEC.8.3	Thus says 
ZEC.8.4	Thus says 
ZEC.8.5	The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.” 
ZEC.8.6	“Thus says 
ZEC.8.7	“Thus says 
ZEC.8.8	I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem. They will be My people and I will be their God, in truth and righteousness.’ 
ZEC.8.9	“Thus says 
ZEC.8.10	Before those days there were no wages for man or animal, nor was there any 
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.8.12	“For there will be a sowing of 
ZEC.8.13	It will happen that just as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you and you will be a blessing. Fear not! Let your hands be strong!’ 
ZEC.8.14	For thus says 
ZEC.8.15	so I have again determined in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear not! 
ZEC.8.16	These are the things that you are to do: speak the truth one to another; administer the judgment of truth and 
ZEC.8.17	do not let any of you devise evil in your hearts against your neighbor; and do not love false oaths, for I hate all these things,”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.8.18	Again the word of 
ZEC.8.19	 “Thus says 
ZEC.8.20	Thus says 
ZEC.8.21	The inhabitants of one city will go to another saying ‘Let us go to entreat the favor of 
ZEC.8.22	Indeed, many peoples and powerful nations will come to seek 
ZEC.8.23	Thus says 
ZEC.9.1	The burden of the word of 
ZEC.9.2	and also upon Hamath bordering it, and upon Tyre and Sidon, though they are very shrewd. 
ZEC.9.3	Tyre built herself a fortress and heaped up silver like dust and fine gold like dirt in the streets. 
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord will impoverish her and destroy her power on the sea, while she will be devoured by fire. 
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon will see it and fear. Gaza will writhe in pain as will Ekron because her hope will dry up. The king will perish from Gaza and Ashkelon will be uninhabited. 
ZEC.9.6	A mongrel people will live in Ashdod and I will cut off the Philistines’ pride. 
ZEC.9.7	I will remove the blood from his mouth, forbidden food from between his teeth. Whoever is left will be a remnant for our God. He will be like a leader in Judah, and Ekron will be like a Jebusite. 
ZEC.9.8	But I will camp around My House against marauding forces. No oppressor will overrun them again— for now I watch with My own eyes. 
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! Shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you, a righteous one bringing salvation. He is lowly, riding on a donkey— on a colt, the foal of a donkey. 
ZEC.9.10	I will banish chariots from Ephraim and horses from Jerusalem, and the war bow will be broken. He will speak 
ZEC.9.11	As for you also, by the blood of your covenant, I will release your prisoners from the waterless Pit. 
ZEC.9.12	Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope! Today I declare that I will restore twice as much to you. 
ZEC.9.13	I will bend Judah as my bow and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, O Zion against your sons, O Greece. I will wield you like a warrior’s sword. 
ZEC.9.14	Then 
ZEC.9.15	 will defend them. They will consume and conquer with sling stones. They will drink and roar as with wine and be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar. 
ZEC.9.16	 their God will save them on that day as the flock of His people. They will be like gems of a crown sparkling over His land. 
ZEC.9.17	How good and beautiful it will be! Grain will make the young men thrive and new wine the virgin women.”
ZEC.10.1	Ask 
ZEC.10.2	The idols utter deceit and diviners see lies. They relate false dreams and comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, afflicted because there is no shepherd. 
ZEC.10.3	My anger burns against the shepherds and I will punish the leaders. 
ZEC.10.4	From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow and from him every leader together. 
ZEC.10.5	They will be like mighty men treading down muddy streets in war. They will fight, because 
ZEC.10.6	I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back, for I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had never spurned them, for I am 
ZEC.10.7	The Ephraimites will be like a warrior. Their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see and be glad. Their hearts will rejoice in 
ZEC.10.8	I will signal for them and gather them. Surely I will redeem them and they will be as numerous as before. 
ZEC.10.9	Though I scatter them among the peoples, they will remember Me in distant places. They and their children will survive and return. 
ZEC.10.10	I will restore from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon till there is no room for them. 
ZEC.10.11	He will cross the turbulent sea and calm its raging waves. All the depths of the Nile will dry up, the pride of Assyria brought down, the scepter of Egypt removed. 
ZEC.10.12	So I will strengthen them in 
ZEC.11.1	Open your gates, Lebanon— fire will devour your cedars! 
ZEC.11.2	Wail, cypress tree! For the cedar has fallen. Those majestic ones are devastated. Wail, oaks of Bashan! For the thick forest is cut down! 
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed! Listen to the roaring of young lions, for Jordan’s thickets are ruined!
ZEC.11.4	Thus said 
ZEC.11.5	Their buyers slay them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be 
ZEC.11.6	I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.11.7	So I pastured the flock for the slaughter, especially the afflicted of the flock. Then I took two staffs—one I called Favor and the other I called Union—and I pastured the flock. 
ZEC.11.8	Next I disposed of the three shepherds in one month—for my soul was impatient with them and their soul also detested me. 
ZEC.11.9	Then I said, “I will not shepherd you! Let the dying die, let the perishing perish, and let those who are left eat one another’s flesh!” 
ZEC.11.10	So I took my staff called Favor and broke it to pieces, in order to break my covenant that I made with all people. 
ZEC.11.11	It was broken on that day. The afflicted of the flock that were watching me knew that this was the word of 
ZEC.11.12	Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, pay me my wages, but if not, don’t bother!” So they weighed out my wages—30 pieces of silver. 
ZEC.11.13	Then 
ZEC.11.14	Then I broke my second staff called Union, in order to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
ZEC.11.15	Again 
ZEC.11.16	For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the dying, seek out the young or heal the injured or nourish the healthy. Instead he will eat the meat of the choice sheep, even tearing off their hoofs.” 
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock! May a sword fell his arm and his right eye! May his arm be all withered and his right eye totally blinded!” 
ZEC.12.1	The burden of the word of 
ZEC.12.2	“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples when they besiege Jerusalem as well as Judah. 
ZEC.12.3	Moreover, in that day I will make Jerusalem a massive stone for all the people. All who try to lift it will be cut to pieces. Nevertheless, all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against her. 
ZEC.12.4	In that day”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.12.5	Then the leaders of Judah will say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength through 
ZEC.12.6	“In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a burning torch among sheaves. They will devour on the right and on the left all the surrounding peoples, yet Jerusalem will remain in her place, in Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.7	 also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and the honor of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not exceed that of Judah. 
ZEC.12.8	In that day 
ZEC.12.9	It will happen in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.10	“Then I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication, when they will look toward Me whom they pierced. They will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son and grieve bitterly for him, as one grieves for a firstborn. 
ZEC.12.11	In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, mourning like Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo. 
ZEC.12.12	The land will mourn clan by clan. The clan of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves, the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves, 
ZEC.12.13	the clan of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves, the clan of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves.
ZEC.12.14	Each of the remaining clans will mourn by itself and their wives by themselves.”
ZEC.13.1	“In that day a spring will be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and impurity. 
ZEC.13.2	It will happen in that day”—it is a declaration of 
ZEC.13.3	If anyone still prophesies his father and his mother to whom he was born will say to him, ‘You cannot live because you tell lies in the Name of 
ZEC.13.4	Therefore in that day each ‘prophet’ will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies. He will no longer wear a hairy mantle in order to deceive 
ZEC.13.5	but will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer—I have been a bondservant from my youth.’ 
ZEC.13.6	Then someone will ask him, “What are these wounds between your hands?”—and he will answer, “Those that I received in the house of my friends.” 
ZEC.13.7	Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, against the man who is My companion! It is a declaration of 
ZEC.13.8	Then it will happen —it is a declaration of 
ZEC.13.9	This third I will bring through the fire. I will refine them as silver is refined, and will test them as gold is tested. They will call on My Name and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are My people,’ and they will answer, ‘
ZEC.14.1	Behold, a day of 
ZEC.14.2	I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to wage war. The city shall be captured, the houses ransacked and the women ravished. Half of the city will be exiled but the remainder of the people will not be cut off from the city. 
ZEC.14.3	Then 
ZEC.14.4	In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a huge valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north and half of it toward the south. 
ZEC.14.5	Then you will flee through My mountain valley because the mountain valley will reach to Azel. Yes, you will flee like you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. Then 
ZEC.14.6	In that day there will be no light, cold or frost. 
ZEC.14.7	It will be a day known only to 
ZEC.14.8	Moreover, in that day living waters will flow from Jerusalem, half toward the eastern sea and half toward the western sea, both in the summer and in the winter. 
ZEC.14.9	 will then be King over all the earth. In that day 
ZEC.14.10	The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. Jerusalem will be raised up and occupy her place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses. 
ZEC.14.11	People will dwell in her, and no longer will there be a ban of destruction—Jerusalem will live in security. 
ZEC.14.12	Now this is the plague with which 
ZEC.14.13	It will happen in that day that a great panic from 
ZEC.14.14	Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding peoples will be gathered together—an abundance of gold, silver and apparel. 
ZEC.14.15	A similar plague will strike the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the animals in that camp. 
ZEC.14.16	Then all the survivors from all the nations that attacked Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, 
ZEC.14.17	Furthermore, if any of the nations on earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, 
ZEC.14.18	If the Egyptians do not go up and celebrate, they will have no rain. Instead, there will be the plague that

PSA.8.5	what is man, that You are mindful of him? And the son of man, that You care for him? 
PSA.8.6	Yet You made him a little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and majesty! 
PSA.8.7	You gave him dominion over the works of Your hands. You put all things under their feet:

PSA.17.11	Our steps are now surrounded. They set their eyes to throw us down to the ground, 
PSA.17.12	like a lion eager to tear to pieces, like a young lion crouching in cover. 
PSA.17.13	Arise, 
PSA.17.14	from men, with Your hand, 
PSA.17.15	I in righteousness will behold Your face! When I awake, I will be satisfied with Your likeness.
PSA.18.1	For the music director: a psalm of David the servant of 
PSA.18.2	He said, I love You, 
PSA.18.3	 is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer. My God is my rock, in Him I take refuge, my shield, my horn of salvation, my stronghold. 
PSA.18.4	I called upon 
PSA.18.5	Cords of death entangled me. Torrents of Belial overwhelmed me. 
PSA.18.6	Cords of 
PSA.18.7	In my distress I called on 
PSA.18.8	Then the earth rocked and quaked. The foundations of mountains trembled. They reeled because He was angry. 
PSA.18.9	Smoke rose from His nostrils and consuming fire from His mouth. Coals blazed from Him. 
PSA.18.10	He parted the heavens and came down, with thick darkness under His feet. 
PSA.18.11	He rode upon a 
PSA.18.12	He made darkness His cover, His 
PSA.18.13	Out of the brilliance before Him passed His thick clouds, hail and fiery coals. 
PSA.18.14	 also thundered in the heavens, and Elyon gave forth His voice, hail and fiery coals. 
PSA.18.15	He shot His arrows and scattered them, hurled lightning bolts and routed them. 
PSA.18.16	Then ravines of water appeared. The foundations of earth were exposed, at Your rebuke, 
PSA.18.17	He reached down from on high and took hold of me. He drew me out of mighty waters. 
PSA.18.18	He saved me from my powerful enemy, from those who hated me— for they were much stronger than me. 
PSA.18.19	They came against me in my day of calamity, but 
PSA.18.20	He brought me out to a wide-open place. He rescued me since He delighted in me. 
PSA.18.21	 rewarded me for my righteousness. For the cleanness of my hands He repaid me. 
PSA.18.22	For I kept the ways of 
PSA.18.23	For all His judgments are before me. I do not put His rulings away from me. 
PSA.18.24	I also had integrity with Him, and kept myself from my sin. 
PSA.18.25	So 
PSA.18.26	With the loyal You deal loyally. With the blameless You are blameless. 
PSA.18.27	With the pure You are pure, and with the crooked You are shrewd. 
PSA.18.28	For You save lowly people, but haughty eyes You humble. 
PSA.18.29	For You light up my lamp. 
PSA.18.30	For with You I rush on a troop, with my God I scale a wall. 
PSA.18.31	As for God, His way is perfect. The word of 
PSA.18.32	For who is God, except 
PSA.18.33	God girds me with strength and makes my way straight. 
PSA.18.34	He makes my feet like those of deer and makes me stand on my heights. 
PSA.18.35	He trains my hands for battle, so my arms can bend a bronze bow. 
PSA.18.36	You gave me the shield of Your salvation. Your right hand upholds me, Your gentleness makes me great. 
PSA.18.37	You broaden my steps beneath me, so my ankles have not slipped. 
PSA.18.38	I pursue my enemies and overtake them, and will not return till they are wiped out. 
PSA.18.39	I will crush them till they cannot rise, till they fall beneath my feet. 
PSA.18.40	For You girded me with strength for battle. You made those who rose up against me bow down before me. 
PSA.18.41	You also made my enemies turn their backs to me. I cut off those who hate me. 
PSA.18.42	They cry out, but there is none to save —even to 
PSA.18.43	Then I beat them as fine as dust before the wind. I pour them out like mud in the streets. 
PSA.18.44	You free me from strifes of the people. You set me as head of the nations— people I did not know are serving me. 
PSA.18.45	As soon as they hear, they obey me. Children of foreigners cringe before me. 
PSA.18.46	Children of foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their hideouts.

PSA.18.48	God—He gives me vengeance and subdues peoples under me. 
PSA.18.49	He delivers me from my enemies. Indeed You lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man. 
PSA.18.50	Therefore I praise You among the nations, 
PSA.18.51	Great victories He gives to His king. He shows loyal love to His anointed— to David and his seed, forever. 
PSA.19.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. 
PSA.19.2	The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky shows His handiwork. 
PSA.19.3	Day to day they speak, night to night they reveal knowledge. 
PSA.19.4	There is no speech, no words, where their voice goes unheard. 
PSA.19.5	Their voice has gone out to all the earth and their words to the end of the world. In the heavens He pitched a tent for the sun. 
PSA.19.6	It is like a bridegroom coming out of his bridal chamber. It is like a strong man rejoicing to run his course. 
PSA.19.7	It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other end. Nothing is hidden from its heat. 
PSA.19.8	The 
PSA.19.9	The precepts of 
PSA.19.10	The fear of 
PSA.19.11	They are more desirable than gold, yes, more than much pure gold! They are sweeter than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. 
PSA.19.12	Moreover by them Your servant is warned. In keeping them there is great reward. 
PSA.19.13	Who can discern his errors? Cleanse me of hidden faults. 
PSA.19.14	Also keep Your servant from willful sins. May they not have dominion over me. Then I will be blameless, free from great transgression. 
PSA.19.15	May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before You, 
PSA.20.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. 
PSA.20.2	May 
PSA.20.3	May He send you help from the Sanctuary and support you from Zion. 
PSA.20.4	May He remember all your meal offerings and accept the fat of your burnt offering. Selah 
PSA.20.5	May He grant you your heart’s desire and fulfill all your plans. 
PSA.20.6	We will shout for joy in your victory and lift up our banners in the Name of our God! May 
PSA.20.7	Now I know that 
PSA.20.8	Some have chariots, some have horses, but we remember the Name of 
PSA.20.9	They have collapsed and fallen, but we rise up and support each other. 
PSA.20.10	, save the king! Answer us on the day we call! 
PSA.21.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. 
PSA.21.2	, the king rejoices in Your strength! How greatly he delights in Your salvation. 
PSA.21.3	You granted him his heart’s desire, and You did not withhold the request of his lips. Selah 
PSA.21.4	For You met him with the best blessings. You set on his head a crown of pure gold. 
PSA.21.5	He asked You for life, You gave it to him, length of days forever and ever. 
PSA.21.6	His glory is great through Your salvation. Honor and majesty You bestow on him. 
PSA.21.7	For You bestow on him eternal blessings, gladden him with joy in Your presence. 
PSA.21.8	For the king trusts in 
PSA.21.9	Your hand will find all your enemies. Your right hand will overtake those who hate You. 
PSA.21.10	You will make them like a fiery furnace at the time of your appearing. In His wrath 
PSA.21.11	You destroy their offspring from earth, their seed from the children of men. 
PSA.21.12	Though they intended evil against You and devised a plot, they cannot succeed. 
PSA.21.13	For You make them turn their backs. You aim Your bowstrings at their faces. 
PSA.21.14	Be exalted, 
PSA.22.1	For the music director, on “The Doe of the Dawn,” a psalm of David. 
PSA.22.2	My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Distant from my salvation are the words of my groaning. 
PSA.22.3	O my God, I cried out by day, but You did not answer, by night, but there was no rest for me. 
PSA.22.4	Yet You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. 
PSA.22.5	In You our fathers put their trust. They trusted, and You delivered them. 
PSA.22.6	They cried to you and were delivered. In You they trusted, and were not disappointed. 
PSA.22.7	Am I a worm, and not a man? Am I a scorn of men, despised by people? 
PSA.22.8	All who see me mock me. They curl their lips, shaking their heads: 
PSA.22.9	“Rely on 
PSA.22.10	Yet You brought me out of the womb, made me secure at my mother’s breasts. 
PSA.22.11	From the womb I was cast on You— from my mother’s womb You have been my God. 
PSA.22.12	Be not far from me! For trouble is near— there is no one to help. 
PSA.22.13	Many bulls have surrounded me. Strong bulls of Bashan encircled me. 
PSA.22.14	They open wide their mouths against me, like a tearing, roaring lion. 
PSA.22.15	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed. My heart is like wax— melting within my innards. 
PSA.22.16	My strength is dried up like a clay pot, my tongue clings to my jaws. You lay me in the dust of death. 
PSA.22.17	For dogs have surrounded me. A band of evildoers has closed in on me. They pierced my hands and my feet. 
PSA.22.18	I can count all my bones. They stare, they gape at me. 
PSA.22.19	They divide my clothes among them, and cast lots for my garment. 
PSA.22.20	But You, 
PSA.22.21	Deliver my soul from the sword— my only one from the power of the dog. 
PSA.22.22	Save me from the lion’s mouth. From the horns of the wild oxen rescue me. 
PSA.22.23	I will declare Your Name to my brothers. I will praise You amid the congregation. 
PSA.22.24	You who fear 
PSA.22.25	For He has not despised or disdained the suffering of the lowly one. Nor has He hidden His face from him, but when he cried to Him, He heard. 
PSA.22.26	From You is my praise in the great assembly. I will fulfill my vows before those who fear Him. 
PSA.22.27	Let the poor eat and be satisfied. Let them who seek after Him praise 
PSA.22.28	All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to 
PSA.22.29	For the kingdom belongs to 
PSA.22.30	All the rich of the earth will feast and worship. Everyone who goes down to the dust will kneel before Him—even the one who could not keep his own soul alive. 
PSA.22.31	His posterity will serve him, telling the next generation about my Lord. 
PSA.22.32	They will come and declare His righteousness to a people yet to be born— because He has done it!
PSA.23.1	A psalm of David. 
PSA.23.2	He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
PSA.23.3	He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for His Name’s sake. 
PSA.23.4	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me: Your rod and Your staff comfort me. 
PSA.23.5	You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You have anointed my head with oil, my cup overflows. 
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of 
PSA.24.1	A psalm of David. The earth is 
PSA.24.2	For He founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the rivers. 
PSA.24.3	Who may go up on the mountain of 
PSA.24.4	One with clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully. 
PSA.24.5	He will receive a blessing from 
PSA.24.6	Such is the generation seeking Him, seeking Your face, even Jacob! Selah 
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors: that the King of glory may come in. 
PSA.24.8	“Who is this King of glory?” 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift them up, you everlasting doors: that the King of glory may come in. 
PSA.24.10	“Who is this King of glory?” 
PSA.25.1	Of David. To You, 
PSA.25.2	O my God, in You I trust, so I will not be ashamed, and my enemies will not gloat over me. 
PSA.25.3	Surely no one who waits for You will be ashamed. But the treacherous without cause will be ashamed. 
PSA.25.4	Show me Your ways, 
PSA.25.5	Guide me in Your truth, and teach me, for You are God, my salvation, for You I wait all day. 
PSA.25.6	Remember, 
PSA.25.7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellion. According to Your mercy remember me, for the sake of Your goodness, 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright is 
PSA.25.9	He guides the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble His way. 
PSA.25.10	All 
PSA.25.11	For Your Name’s sake, 
PSA.25.12	Who is this man who fears 
PSA.25.13	His soul abides in goodness, and his offspring will inherit the land. 
PSA.25.14	The secret of 
PSA.25.15	My eyes are always looking to 
PSA.25.16	Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted. 
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart increase. Bring me out of my distress. 
PSA.25.18	See my affliction and my suffering, and take away all my sins. 
PSA.25.19	See my enemies, how many they are— they hate me with violent hatred. 
PSA.25.20	Guard my soul and deliver me. Let me not be ashamed, for I take refuge in You. 
PSA.25.21	May integrity and uprightness protect me—for I wait for You. 
PSA.25.22	Redeem Israel, O God, from all their troubles.
PSA.26.1	Of David. Vindicate me, 
PSA.26.2	Probe me, 
PSA.26.3	For Your love is before my eyes and I have walked in Your truth. 
PSA.26.4	I have not sat with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites. 
PSA.26.5	I detest the company of evildoers, and do not sit with the wicked. 
PSA.26.6	I will wash my hands in innocence, so I can walk around Your altar, 
PSA.26.7	hearing the voice of thanksgiving while proclaiming all Your wonders. 
PSA.26.8	, I love the House where You live, the place where Your glory dwells. 
PSA.26.9	Do not take my soul away with sinners, nor my life with people of bloodshed— 
PSA.26.10	in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hand is full of bribes. 
PSA.26.11	But I—I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me and be gracious to me. 
PSA.26.12	My feet stand on level ground. In congregations I will bless 
PSA.27.1	Of David. 
PSA.27.2	When evildoers approached me to devour my flesh —my adversaries and my foes— they stumbled and fell. 
PSA.27.3	Though an army camp besieges me, my heart will not fear. Though war breaks out against me, even then will I be confident. 
PSA.27.4	One thing have I asked of 
PSA.27.5	For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His 
PSA.27.6	Then will my head be high above my enemies around me. In His Tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy. I will sing, yes, sing praises to 
PSA.27.7	Hear, 
PSA.27.8	To You my heart says: “Seek My face.” Your face, 
PSA.27.9	Do not hide Your face from me. Do not turn Your servant away in anger. You have been my help. Do not abandon me or forsake me, O God my salvation. 
PSA.27.10	Though my father and my mother forsake me, 
PSA.27.11	Teach me Your way, 
PSA.27.12	Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes. For false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence. 
PSA.27.13	Surely I trust that I will see the goodness of 
PSA.27.14	Wait for 
PSA.28.1	Of David. To You, 
PSA.28.2	Hear the sound of my pleas, when I cry to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy Sanctuary. 
PSA.28.3	Do not drag me away with the wicked and with doers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbors, while evil is in their hearts. 
PSA.28.4	Repay them for their deeds, their evil acts. Repay them for the deeds of their hands. Bring back on them what they deserve. 
PSA.28.5	Since they show no regard for the deeds of 
PSA.28.6	Blessed be 
PSA.28.7	 is my strength and my shield. My heart trusts in Him, and I was helped. Therefore my heart leaps for joy, and I will praise Him with my song. 
PSA.28.8	 is their strength—a stronghold of salvation for His anointed. 
PSA.28.9	Save Your people, bless Your inheritance, shepherd them and carry them forever. 
PSA.29.1	A psalm of David. Ascribe to 
PSA.29.2	Ascribe to 
PSA.29.3	The voice of 
PSA.29.4	The voice of 
PSA.29.5	The voice of 
PSA.29.6	He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox. 
PSA.29.7	The voice of 
PSA.29.8	The voice of 
PSA.29.9	The voice of 
PSA.29.10	 sits enthroned over the flood. Yes, 
PSA.29.11	 gives strength to His people. 
PSA.30.1	A psalm, a song for the dedication of the Temple, of David. 
PSA.30.2	I will exalt You, 
PSA.30.3	 my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me. 
PSA.30.4	, You brought my soul up from 
PSA.30.5	Sing praise to 
PSA.30.6	For His anger lasts for only a moment, His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning. 
PSA.30.7	When I felt secure, I said: “I will never be shaken.” 
PSA.30.8	, in Your favor You made my mountain stand strong. When You hid Your face, I was terrified. 
PSA.30.9	To You, 
PSA.30.10	“What gain is there in my blood, in my going down to the Pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth? 
PSA.30.11	Hear, 
PSA.30.12	You turned my mourning into dancing. You removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy. 
PSA.30.13	So my glory will sing to You and not be silent. 
PSA.31.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. 
PSA.31.2	In You, 
PSA.31.3	Turn Your ear to me, rescue me quickly. Be a rock of refuge for me, a stronghold for my deliverance. 
PSA.31.4	Since You are my rock and my fortress, You lead me and guide me for Your Name’s sake. 
PSA.31.5	Free me from the net they hid for me, for You are my refuge. 
PSA.31.6	Into Your hand I commit my spirit. You have redeemed me, 
PSA.31.7	I detest those who continue to watch worthless idols, but I trust in 
PSA.31.8	I will be glad and rejoice in Your lovingkindness, for You saw my affliction. You knew the troubles of my soul. 
PSA.31.9	You did not hand me over to the enemy. You set my feet in a wide-open place. 
PSA.31.10	Be gracious to me, 
PSA.31.11	For my life is consumed in sorrow and my years in sighing. My strength fails because of my anguish and my bones waste away. 
PSA.31.12	Because of all my adversaries I am the contempt of my neighbors and a dread to my acquaintances. Seeing me on the street, they flee from me. 
PSA.31.13	I am as forgotten as a dead man. I have become like a broken vessel. 
PSA.31.14	For I have heard the whispering of many. There is terror on every side as they conspire against me and plot to take my life. 
PSA.31.15	But I have trusted in You, 
PSA.31.16	My times are in Your hands. Deliver me from the hands of my foes and from those who pursue me. 
PSA.31.17	Make Your face shine on Your servant. Save me in Your lovingkindness. 
PSA.31.18	, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon You. Let the wicked be ashamed— let them be silent in 
PSA.31.19	Let the lying lips be mute. For they speak arrogantly against the righteous, with pride and contempt. 
PSA.31.20	How great is Your goodness, which You have stored up for those who fear You, which You have given to those who take refuge in You, before the children of men. 
PSA.31.21	In the shelter of Your presence You hide them from people’s plots. You conceal them in a 
PSA.31.22	Blessed be 
PSA.31.23	I said in my alarm, “I have been cut off from Your sight!” But You heard the sound of my pleas when I cried out to You. 
PSA.31.24	Love 
PSA.31.25	! Let your heart take courage, all you who wait for 
PSA.32.1	Of David, a contemplative song. Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned. 
PSA.32.2	Blessed is the one whose guilt 
PSA.32.3	When I kept silent, my bones became brittle through my groaning all day long. 
PSA.32.4	For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me. My strength was drained as in the droughts of summer. Selah 
PSA.32.5	Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity. I said: “I confess my transgressions to 
PSA.32.6	So let everyone who is godly pray to You in a time when You may be found. When great floodwaters rise, they will not reach him. 
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place— You will protect me from distress. You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah 
PSA.32.8	“I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go. I will give counsel—My eye is on you. 
PSA.32.9	Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding, and must be held in with bit and bridle or they will not come to you.” 
PSA.32.10	Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but lovingkindness surrounds the one who trusts in 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in 
PSA.33.1	Sing for joy to 
PSA.33.2	Praise 
PSA.33.3	Sing to Him a new song! Play skillfully amid shouts of joy. 
PSA.33.4	For the word of 
PSA.33.5	He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the love of 
PSA.33.6	By 
PSA.33.7	He gathers the waters of the sea together in a heap. He lays up deep waters in storehouses. 
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear 
PSA.33.9	For He spoke, and it came to be. He commanded, and it stood firm. 
PSA.33.10	 foils the purpose of the nations. He thwarts the plans of the peoples. 
PSA.33.11	The plan of 
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is 
PSA.33.13	 looks down from heaven. He observes all humanity. 
PSA.33.14	From His dwelling place He gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth— 
PSA.33.15	He who fashions the hearts of all, who discerns all their deeds. 
PSA.33.16	No king is saved by his great army, no warrior is delivered by great strength. 
PSA.33.17	A horse is a false hope for victory, nor can its great strength save. 
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eyes of 
PSA.33.19	to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
PSA.33.20	Our soul waits for 
PSA.33.21	Our heart rejoices in Him, because we trusted in His holy Name. 
PSA.33.22	Let Your lovingkindness, 
PSA.34.1	Of David, when he feigned insanity before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left. 
PSA.34.2	I will bless 
PSA.34.3	 My soul boasts in 
PSA.34.4	Magnify 
PSA.34.5	I sought 
PSA.34.6	They who looked to Him were radiant, and their faces will never be ashamed. 
PSA.34.7	This poor man cried, and 
PSA.34.8	The angel of 
PSA.34.9	Taste and see how good 
PSA.34.10	Fear 
PSA.34.11	Young lions may lack, and go hungry, but those who seek 
PSA.34.12	Come, children, listen to me: I will teach you the fear of 
PSA.34.13	Who is the one who delights in life, and loves to see good days? 
PSA.34.14	Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking treachery. 
PSA.34.15	Depart from evil and do good. Seek 
PSA.34.16	The eyes of 
PSA.34.17	The face of 
PSA.34.18	The righteous cry out and 
PSA.34.19	 is close to the brokenhearted, and saves those crushed in spirit. 
PSA.34.20	Many are the distresses of the righteous, but 
PSA.34.21	He keeps all his bones— not one of them is broken. 
PSA.34.22	Evil kills the wicked— those who hate the righteous will be held guilty. 
PSA.34.23	 redeems the soul of His servants —no one who takes refuge in Him will be held guilty. 
PSA.35.1	A psalm of David. 
PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to my help. 
PSA.35.3	Draw out also a spear and battle-axe. Stop those who pursue me. Say to my soul: “I am your salvation.” 
PSA.35.4	May those who seek my life be ashamed and disgraced. May they be turned back and humiliated —those who plot evil against me. 
PSA.35.5	May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of 
PSA.35.6	May their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of 
PSA.35.7	For without cause they hid their net for me, and without cause they dug a pit for my soul. 
PSA.35.8	Let ruin come upon him by surprise. Let the net he hid entangle himself —into that same pit let him fall. 
PSA.35.9	Then my soul will rejoice in 
PSA.35.10	All my bones will say: “
PSA.35.11	Violent witnesses rise up. They question me about things I know nothing about. 
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil for good— my soul is forlorn. 
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I afflicted my soul with fasting, my prayer kept returning to my heart. 
PSA.35.14	I went about mourning as though for my own friend or brother. I bowed down dressed in black as though for my own mother. 
PSA.35.15	But at my stumbling they gathered in glee. Wretches gathered against me whom I did not know, tearing at me without ceasing. 
PSA.35.16	They mocked profanely, as if at a feast, they gnashed at me with their teeth. 
PSA.35.17	My Lord, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages— my solitary existence from the lions. 
PSA.35.18	I praise You in the great assembly, acclaiming You among a throng of people. 
PSA.35.19	Do not let my deceitful enemies gloat over me without cause, nor let those who hate me for nothing wink an eye. 
PSA.35.20	For they never speak 
PSA.35.21	Yes, they open their mouth wide against me, saying: “Aha! Aha! Our own eyes have seen it!” 
PSA.35.22	You have seen it, 
PSA.35.23	Arise, awaken to my defense, to my cause—my God and my Lord! 
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me, 
PSA.35.25	Don’t let them say in their heart: “Aha! Just what we wanted!” Don’t let them say: “We swallowed him up!” 
PSA.35.26	May they be ashamed and humiliated, those who rejoice over my misery. May they who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace. 
PSA.35.27	May they shout for joy and be glad, those who delight in my righteous cause. May they always say: “Exalted be 
PSA.35.28	Then my tongue will declare aloud Your justice and Your praises all day.
PSA.36.1	For the music director, of David the servant of 
PSA.36.2	An oracle of Transgression— within my heart, to the wicked one: “There is no fear of God before his eyes. 
PSA.36.3	For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to notice his iniquity —or hate it. 
PSA.36.4	His mouth’s words are iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and do good. 
PSA.36.5	Even on his bed he plans sin. He puts himself on a path that is no good, never refusing evil.” 
PSA.36.6	Your love, 
PSA.36.7	Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like the great deep. You preserve man and beast, 
PSA.36.8	How precious is Your love, O God! The children of men find refuge in the shadow of Your wings. 
PSA.36.9	They drink their fill from the abundance of Your House. You give them drink from the river of Your delights. 
PSA.36.10	For with You is the fountain of life— in Your light we see light. 
PSA.36.11	Continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, and Your justice to the upright in heart. 
PSA.36.12	May the foot of pride never tread on me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
PSA.36.13	There the evildoers lie fallen— thrown down, not able to rise! 
PSA.37.1	Of David. Do not fret because of evildoers, nor be envious of them who do wrong. 
PSA.37.2	For like the grass they soon wither and fade like a green herb. 
PSA.37.3	Trust in 
PSA.37.4	Delight yourself in 
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to 
PSA.37.6	He will bring out your vindication as light, and your cause will shine as noonday. 
PSA.37.7	Be still before 
PSA.37.8	Put away anger and turn from wrath. Do not fret—it only leads to doing evil. 
PSA.37.9	For evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait for 
PSA.37.10	Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Yes, you will look at his place, but he will not be there. 
PSA.37.11	But the meek will inherit the land, and delight in abundant 
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes at him with his teeth. 
PSA.37.13	The Lord laughs at him— for He sees his day is coming. 
PSA.37.14	The wicked have unsheathed their sword and have bent their bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose conduct is upright. 
PSA.37.15	Their sword will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. 
PSA.37.16	Better a little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked. 
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken, while 
PSA.37.18	 knows the days of the blameless— their inheritance endures forever. 
PSA.37.19	They will not be ashamed in an evil time and in days of famine they will be satisfied. 
PSA.37.20	For the wicked will perish, and the enemies of 
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous is a gracious giver. 
PSA.37.22	For His blessed ones inherit the land. But those He curses will be cut off. 
PSA.37.23	From 
PSA.37.24	Though he stumble, he will not fall headlong, for 
PSA.37.25	I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous one forsaken, nor his children begging for bread. 
PSA.37.26	All day long he is gracious and lends. So his offspring will be a blessing. 
PSA.37.27	Turn from evil and do good, so you may live forever. 
PSA.37.28	For 
PSA.37.29	The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. 
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom and his tongue speaks justice. 
PSA.37.31	The 
PSA.37.32	The wicked lies in wait for the righteous, seeking to slay him. 
PSA.37.33	But 
PSA.37.34	Wait for 
PSA.37.35	I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a leafy tree in native soil. 
PSA.37.36	But once he passed by, he was no more. Though I looked for him, he could not be found. 
PSA.37.37	Notice the man of integrity and watch the upright— for the man of 
PSA.37.38	But transgressors will be destroyed altogether. The future of the wicked will be cut off. 
PSA.37.39	Yet the salvation of the righteous is from 
PSA.37.40	 helps them and delivers them. He rescues them from the wicked and saves them— because they take refuge in Him.
PSA.38.1	A psalm of David, for a memorial. 
PSA.38.2	, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath. 
PSA.38.3	For Your arrows have sunk deep into me and Your hand has pressed down on me. 
PSA.38.4	There is no health in my flesh because of Your indignation. There is no wholeness in my bones because of my sin. 
PSA.38.5	For my iniquities are on my head— like a burden too heavy for me. 
PSA.38.6	My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness. 
PSA.38.7	I am bent over, bowed down greatly. All day I walk about in mourning. 
PSA.38.8	For my heart is filled with burning pain, and there is no health in my body. 
PSA.38.9	I am numb and utterly crushed. I groan because of anguish in my heart. 
PSA.38.10	My Lord, all my longing is before You, and my sighing is not hidden from You. 
PSA.38.11	My heart pounds, my strength fails me. The light of my eyes—also, not with me. 
PSA.38.12	My friends and my companions stay away from my wound, and my kinsmen stand far off. 
PSA.38.13	They who seek my life set traps. Those who seek my hurt threaten destruction, uttering lies all day. 
PSA.38.14	But I, like someone deaf, hear nothing, like a mute, not opening his mouth. 
PSA.38.15	Yes, I am like one who cannot hear, whose mouth has no arguments. 
PSA.38.16	But I wait for You, 
PSA.38.17	For I said: “Don’t let them gloat over me or exalt themselves over me, when my foot slips.” 
PSA.38.18	For I am about to fall, and my pain is before me constantly. 
PSA.38.19	So I confess my guilt. I am troubled because of my sin. 
PSA.38.20	My lively enemies are numerous. Many hate me wrongfully. 
PSA.38.21	Those who repay evil for good oppose me because I pursue what is good. 
PSA.38.22	Do not forsake me, 
PSA.38.23	Hurry to my aid, my Lord, my salvation.
PSA.39.1	For the music director, for Jeduthun, a psalm of David. 
PSA.39.2	I said: “I will guard my ways, so I will not sin with my tongue. I will muzzle my mouth while the wicked are before me.” 
PSA.39.3	So I became utterly speechless, kept silent even from good, but my anguish was stirred up. 
PSA.39.4	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue: 
PSA.39.5	“Let me know, 
PSA.39.6	Behold, You made my days mere hand-breadths, and my lifetime as nothing before You. Surely all humanity is but vapor. Selah 
PSA.39.7	Everyone goes about as a mere phantom. Surely they are making an uproar in vain, heaping up stuff— yet not knowing who will gather it. 
PSA.39.8	And now, my Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You. 
PSA.39.9	Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of a fool. 
PSA.39.10	I am speechless, not opening my mouth —for You have done it. 
PSA.39.11	Remove Your scourge from me. I perish by the blow of Your hand. 
PSA.39.12	With rebukes You chasten one for iniquity and You consume like a moth what he finds pleasure in. Surely all humanity is but a vapor. Selah 
PSA.39.13	Hear my prayer, 
PSA.39.14	Turn your gaze away from me, so I may smile again, before I go, and am no more.” 
PSA.40.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. 
PSA.40.2	I waited patiently for 
PSA.40.3	He brought me up out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire. Then He set my feet on a rock. He made my steps firm. 
PSA.40.4	He put a new song in my mouth— a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and trust in 
PSA.40.5	Blessed is the one who put his confidence in 
PSA.40.6	Many things You have done, 
PSA.40.7	Sacrifice and offering You did not desire —my ears You have opened— burnt offering and sin offering You did not require. 
PSA.40.8	Then I said: “Here I am, I have come— in the scroll of a book it is written about me. 
PSA.40.9	I delight to do Your will, O my God. Yes, Your 
PSA.40.10	I proclaim good news of righteousness in the great assembly. Behold, I am not shutting my lips— 
PSA.40.11	I did not hide Your righteousness within my heart. Rather I declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation. I did not conceal Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great assembly. 
PSA.40.12	, do not withhold Your compassions from me. Let Your mercy and Your truth always protect me. 
PSA.40.13	For evils beyond number surround me, my sins have overtaken me —I cannot see— they are more than the hairs of my head —and my heart fails me. 
PSA.40.14	, please deliver me! 
PSA.40.15	Let those who seek my life to sweep it away be put to shame and humiliated. Let those who wish me evil be turned back in disgrace. 
PSA.40.16	Let those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled over their own shame. 
PSA.40.17	Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You. Let those who love Your salvation continually say: “
PSA.40.18	But I—I am poor and needy— yet my Lord is mindful of me. You are my help and my deliverer— O my God, do not delay!
PSA.41.1	For the music director: a psalm of David. 
PSA.41.2	Blessed is the one who considers the wretched— 
PSA.41.3	 will protect him and keep him alive. He will be made blessed in the land. You will not give him over to the desire of his foes. 
PSA.41.4	 will strengthen him on his sickbed. May You restore him completely from his bed. 
PSA.41.5	I said: “
PSA.41.6	My enemies speak evil about me: “When will he die and his name perish?” 
PSA.41.7	And if someone of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely. He stores up evil in his heart, then he goes out and chatters. 
PSA.41.8	All who hate me whisper together about me They imagine the worst about me: 
PSA.41.9	“Something evil was poured into him— he will not get up again from the place where he lies.” 
PSA.41.10	Even my own close friend, whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me. 
PSA.41.11	But You, 
PSA.41.12	By this I know that You delight in me: that my enemy does not shout in triumph over me. 
PSA.41.13	You uphold me in my integrity and set me before Your face forever. 
PSA.41.14	Blessed be 
PSA.42.1	For the music director, a contemplative song of the sons of Korah. 
PSA.42.2	As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for You, O God. 
PSA.42.3	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When will I come and appear before God? 
PSA.42.4	My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all day: “Where is your God?” 
PSA.42.5	These things I remember as I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go along with the throng, walking with them to the House of God, with a voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a festival. 
PSA.42.6	Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why are you murmuring within me? Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, for the salvation of His presence. 
PSA.42.7	My God, my soul is downcast within me! Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and from the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mitzar. 
PSA.42.8	Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls. All Your waves and breakers have swept over me. 
PSA.42.9	By day 
PSA.42.10	I will say to God my Rock: “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go about mourning, under the oppression of the enemy?” 
PSA.42.11	As with a crushing in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, by saying to me all day, “Where is your God?” 
PSA.42.12	Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why are you murmuring within me? Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate me, O God, and champion my cause against an ungodly nation. From a deceitful and unjust man, deliver me! 
PSA.43.2	For You are my God, my stronghold. Why have You spurned me? Why do I go about gloomy because of the oppression of the enemy? 
PSA.43.3	Send forth Your light and Your truth— let them guide me. Let them bring me to Your holy mountain and to Your dwelling places. 
PSA.43.4	Then I will come to the altar of God, to the God of my exceeding joy, and praise You upon the harp —O God, my God. 
PSA.43.5	Why are You downcast, O my soul? Why are you murmuring within me? Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance.
PSA.44.1	For the music director, a psalm of the sons of Korah, a contemplative song. 
PSA.44.2	We have heard with our ears, O God —our fathers have told us— of a work You did in their days, in days of old. 
PSA.44.3	With Your hand You displaced nations, but You planted them. You afflicted peoples, and You drove them out. 
PSA.44.4	For it was not by their own sword that they took possession of the land, nor did their own arm save them. But it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face— for You favored them. 
PSA.44.5	You are my King, O God— command victories for Jacob! 
PSA.44.6	Through You we push back our foes. Through Your Name we trample those rising up against us. 
PSA.44.7	For I do not trust in my bow, nor can my sword save me. 
PSA.44.8	For You saved us from our oppressors and put to shame those who hated us. 
PSA.44.9	In God we make our boast all day and Your Name we praise forever. Selah 
PSA.44.10	Yet You have spurned and humiliated us, and no longer go out with our armies. 
PSA.44.11	You make us retreat before the enemy. Those who hate us have plundered us. 
PSA.44.12	You gave us to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations. 
PSA.44.13	You are selling Your people cheaply— not even getting a great price for them. 
PSA.44.14	You made us a taunt for our neighbors, a scorn and ridicule for those around us. 
PSA.44.15	You have made us a byword among the nations, head-wagging among the peoples. 
PSA.44.16	All day my disgrace is before me, and my face is covered with shame— 
PSA.44.17	because of the sound of taunting and reviling from the face of a vengeful enemy. 
PSA.44.18	All this came upon us, though we did not forget You, nor were we false to Your covenant. 
PSA.44.19	Our heart did not turn back, nor did our steps stray from Your path. 
PSA.44.20	Yet You crushed us in a place of jackals, covered us with the shadow of death. 
PSA.44.21	If we had forgotten the Name of our God or stretched our hands to a foreign god, 
PSA.44.22	would God not have discovered it? For He knows the secrets of the heart. 
PSA.44.23	But for Your sake we are slain all day. We are counted as sheep for slaughter. 
PSA.44.24	Awake! Why do you sleep, my Lord? Wake up! Do not cast us off forever. 
PSA.44.25	Why do You hide Your face and forget our misery and oppression? 
PSA.44.26	For our soul sinks down to the dust. Our belly cleaves to the earth. 
PSA.44.27	Arise, be our help, and redeem us for Your mercy’s sake.
PSA.45.1	For the music director, according to “Lilies.” Of the sons of Korah, a contemplative song, a love song. 
PSA.45.2	My heart is stirred with a good word. I speak my verses to the king. My tongue is the pen of a skillful writer. 
PSA.45.3	You are the most handsome of the sons of men. Grace pours from your lips. Therefore God has blessed you forever. 
PSA.45.4	Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and your majesty. 
PSA.45.5	In your majesty ride victoriously, on behalf of truth, meekness and justice. Let your right hand display awesome things. 
PSA.45.6	Your arrows are sharp. Peoples fall beneath you— into the heart of the king’s enemies. 
PSA.45.7	Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and a scepter of justice is the scepter of Your kingdom. 
PSA.45.8	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore, God, your God, anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions. 
PSA.45.9	All your robes have myrrh, aloes, cassia. From ivory palaces, stringed instruments make you glad. 
PSA.45.10	Kings’ daughters are among your honored women. At your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. 
PSA.45.11	“Listen, O daughter, consider and incline your ear. Forget your people and your father’s house. 
PSA.45.12	Then the king will desire your beauty. Honor him, for he is your lord. 
PSA.45.13	A daughter of Tyre comes with a gift. The richest people will court your favor.” 
PSA.45.14	All glorious is the king’s daughter within the palace— her gown is interwoven with gold. 
PSA.45.15	She will be led to the king in embroidered garments. Her virgins, her companions following her, are coming in to you. 
PSA.45.16	They are led in with joy and gladness— they enter into the palace of the king. 
PSA.45.17	Your sons will take your fathers’ place. You will make them princes throughout the land. 
PSA.45.18	I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	For the music director, of the sons of Korah, according to Alamoth, a song. 
PSA.46.2	God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 
PSA.46.3	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth change, though the mountains topple into the heart of the seas, 
PSA.46.4	though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake at their swelling. Selah 
PSA.46.5	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God— the holy dwelling place of Elyon. 
PSA.46.6	God is in the midst of her, she will not be shaken. God will help her when morning dawns. 
PSA.46.7	Nations are in uproar, kingdoms totter, He utters His voice, the earth melts! 
PSA.46.8	 is with us. The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah 
PSA.46.9	Come, see the works of 
PSA.46.10	He makes wars cease to the end of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear. He burns chariots with fire. 
PSA.46.11	“Be still, and know that I am God. I am exalted among the nations. I am exalted in the earth.” 
PSA.46.12	 is with us. The God of Jacob is our strong tower. Selah
PSA.47.1	For the music director, a psalm for the sons of Korah. 
PSA.47.2	Clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to God with the voice of joy! 
PSA.47.3	For 
PSA.47.4	He subdues peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 
PSA.47.5	He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom He loved. Selah 
PSA.47.6	God is gone up amidst shouting, 
PSA.47.7	Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! 
PSA.47.8	For God is the King of all the earth. Sing praises with a skillful song. 
PSA.47.9	God reigns over the nations. God sits upon His holy throne. 
PSA.47.10	The princes of the peoples are gathered as a people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of earth belong to God— He is greatly exalted! 
PSA.48.1	A song, a psalm of the sons of Korah. 
PSA.48.2	Great is 
PSA.48.3	A beautiful height —the joy of the whole earth— is Mount Zion, on the northern side of the city of the great King. 
PSA.48.4	God, in her palaces, is known as a stronghold. 
PSA.48.5	For behold, the kings assembled, they advanced together. 
PSA.48.6	They saw, then they were astounded, they fled in terror. 
PSA.48.7	Trembling seized them there, pain like a woman in labor. 
PSA.48.8	With an east wind You broke the ships of Tarshish. 
PSA.48.9	As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of 
PSA.48.10	We have meditated on Your lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Your Temple. 
PSA.48.11	Like Your Name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness. 
PSA.48.12	Mount Zion is glad, the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of Your judgments. 
PSA.48.13	Walk about Zion, go around her. Count her towers. 
PSA.48.14	Consider her ramparts, go through her palaces, so you may describe it to the next generation. 
PSA.48.15	For this God is our God, forever and ever! He will guide us to the end. 
PSA.49.1	For the music director: a psalm of the sons of Korah. 
PSA.49.2	Hear this, all you peoples. Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world, 
PSA.49.3	both low and high, rich and poor together. 
PSA.49.4	My mouth speaks wisdom, My heart’s meditation is understanding. 
PSA.49.5	I will turn my ear to a proverb. I will utter my riddle on the harp: 
PSA.49.6	Why should I fear in evil days? when the iniquity of my deceivers surrounds me? 
PSA.49.7	Or those trusting in their wealth, boasting about their great riches? 
PSA.49.8	No man can redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom for him. 
PSA.49.9	For the redemption of a soul is costly— so, one should stop trying forever. 
PSA.49.10	Will he live forever— and never see the Pit? 
PSA.49.11	Surely he must see, even wise men die. The fool and the brutish will alike perish, leaving their wealth to others. 
PSA.49.12	Their inward thought is: Their houses are eternal, their dwellings for generation after generation. They name their lands after themselves. 
PSA.49.13	But the pompous man will not endure— he is like the beasts that perish. 
PSA.49.14	Such is the way of the self-confident, and their followers who approve their sayings. Selah 
PSA.49.15	Like sheep they are destined for 
PSA.49.16	But God redeems my soul from the power of 
PSA.49.17	Do not be afraid when a man gets rich, when his house’s splendor increases. 
PSA.49.18	For when he dies he takes nothing away. His splendor will not follow him down. 
PSA.49.19	Though during his life he congratulates himself, and men praise you when you do well for yourself— 
PSA.49.20	He will still join his fathers’ company, who will never see the light. 
PSA.49.21	A pompous man, without understanding— he is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.50.1	A psalm of Asaph. God, Elohim 
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 
PSA.50.3	Our God comes, and does not keep silent. A fire is devouring before Him, and it storms around Him mightily. 
PSA.50.4	He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, to judge His people: 
PSA.50.5	“Gather My 
PSA.50.6	The heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah 
PSA.50.7	“Hear, My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God. 
PSA.50.8	I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, for your burnt offerings are continually before Me. 
PSA.50.9	I have no need of a bull from your house nor goats from your pens. 
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. 
PSA.50.11	I know every bird of the mountains. Everything moving in the field is Mine. 
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you— for the world is Mine and all it contains! 
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 
PSA.50.14	Offer God a sacrifice of thank offerings, then fulfill your vows to Elyon. 
PSA.50.15	Call upon Me in the day of trouble. When I rescue you, you will honor Me.” 
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked, God says: “What are you doing, reciting My laws and taking My covenant in your mouth? 
PSA.50.17	For you hate discipline, and you cast My words behind you. 
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and your portion is with adulterers. 
PSA.50.19	You have unleashed your mouth for evil and harnessed your tongue for deceit. 
PSA.50.20	You sit, speaking against your brother, slandering your own mother’s son. 
PSA.50.21	These things you have done— Should I keep silent? You thought I was just like you— but I reprove you, and set the case before your eyes. 
PSA.50.22	Now consider this, you who forget God. Or else I will tear you in pieces with no one to rescue you. 
PSA.50.23	A sacrifice of praise honors Me, and to the one who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God.”
PSA.51.1	For the music director: a psalm of David, 
PSA.51.2	when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he went to Bathsheba. 
PSA.51.3	Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your mercy. According to Your great compassion blot out my transgressions. 
PSA.51.4	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. 
PSA.51.5	For I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me. 
PSA.51.6	Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You are just when You speak, and blameless when You judge. 
PSA.51.7	Behold, I was born in iniquity and in sin when my mother conceived me. 
PSA.51.8	Surely You desire truth in the inner being. Make me know wisdom inwardly. 
PSA.51.9	Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 
PSA.51.10	Let me hear joy and gladness, so the bones You crushed may rejoice. 
PSA.51.11	Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. 
PSA.51.12	Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. 
PSA.51.13	Do not cast me from Your presence— take not Your 
PSA.51.14	Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit. 
PSA.51.15	Then will I teach transgressors Your ways and sinners will return to You. 
PSA.51.16	Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God— God of my salvation. Then my tongue will sing for joy of Your righteousness. 
PSA.51.17	O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
PSA.51.18	For You would not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it, nor be pleased by burnt offerings. 
PSA.51.19	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise. 
PSA.51.20	In Your favor do good to Zion. Build up the walls of Jerusalem. 
PSA.51.21	Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices and whole burnt offerings. Then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
PSA.52.1	For the music director: a contemplative song of David, 
PSA.52.2	when Doeg the Edomite came and reported to Saul telling him, “David went to Ahimelech’s house.” 
PSA.52.3	Why do you brag about evil, mighty man? God’s lovingkindness is every day. 
PSA.52.4	Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceit. 
PSA.52.5	You love evil instead of good, lying rather than speaking right. Selah 
PSA.52.6	You love only devouring words— treacherous tongue! 
PSA.52.7	God will pull you down forever, and snatch you, rip you out of your tent, and uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 
PSA.52.8	Then the righteous will see and fear, and laugh at him: 
PSA.52.9	“Here is the man who did not make God his stronghold. Instead he trusted in his great riches— and was strong in his evil desire.” 
PSA.52.10	But I—I am like an olive tree flourishing in the House of God. I trust in God’s lovingkindness forever and ever. 
PSA.52.11	I will praise You forever for what You have done. I will hope in Your Name, for it is good, in the presence of Your 
PSA.53.1	For the music director: on Mahalath, a contemplative song of David. 
PSA.53.2	The fool says in his heart: “There is no God.” They are corrupt, commit vile injustice. There is no one who does good. 
PSA.53.3	God looks down from the heavens on the children of men, to see if anyone understands, who seeks after God. 
PSA.53.4	All have turned aside— together they have become corrupt. There is no one who does good— no, not even one! 
PSA.53.5	Will the evildoers never learn? They consume My people as they would eat bread, and never call upon God. 
PSA.53.6	There they are in great dread— where there is nothing to fear. For God has scattered the bones of those besieging you. You have put them to shame, for God has rejected them. 
PSA.53.7	Who will give salvation for Israel out of Zion? When God restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
PSA.54.1	For the music director, on stringed instruments, a contemplative song of David, 
PSA.54.2	when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: “Is not David hiding himself among us?” 
PSA.54.3	O God, save me by Your Name, vindicate me by Your might. 
PSA.54.4	O God, hear my prayer, listen to the words of my mouth. 
PSA.54.5	For strangers have risen up against me. Violent men seek after my soul. They do not set God before them. Selah 
PSA.54.6	Surely God is my helper. My Lord is the supporter of my soul. 
PSA.54.7	Let evil return to my foes. Silence them with Your truth! 
PSA.54.8	I will sacrifice a freewill offering to You. I will praise Your name, 
PSA.54.9	For He has delivered me from all trouble, and my eye has gazed upon my enemies. 
PSA.55.1	For the music director, on stringed instruments, a contemplative song of David. 
PSA.55.2	Give ear, O God, to my prayer and do not ignore my plea for help. 
PSA.55.3	Listen to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint and moan— 
PSA.55.4	because of the voice of the enemy, because of the pressure of the wicked. For they thrust trouble on me, and in anger bear a grudge against me. 
PSA.55.5	My heart shudders within me and the terrors of death sweep over me. 
PSA.55.6	Fear and trembling come upon me and horror has overwhelmed me. 
PSA.55.7	So I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest. 
PSA.55.8	Surely I would flee far away. I would stay in the wilderness. Selah 
PSA.55.9	I would hurry to my shelter from the rushing wind of the storm.” 
PSA.55.10	Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city. 
PSA.55.11	Day and night they make the rounds on her walls. Iniquity and mischief are within her. 
PSA.55.12	Ruins are in her midst. Oppression and deceit never leave her square. 
PSA.55.13	For if it were an enemy taunting me, I could endure it. If my foe was exalting himself over me, I could hide from him. 
PSA.55.14	But it is you, a man like me— my companion and my close friend! 
PSA.55.15	Together we enjoyed great fellowship. We used to walk with the throng in the House of God. 
PSA.55.16	Let desolation come upon them, let them go down alive into 
PSA.55.17	As for me, I will call on God, and 
PSA.55.18	Evening, morning and noon, I complain and moan, then He hears my voice. 
PSA.55.19	He will redeem my soul in 
PSA.55.20	God will hear and humble them —yes, the One enthroned of old. Selah Nothing changes—they do not fear God. 
PSA.55.21	My companion put forth his hands against those at peace with him, as he violates his covenant. 
PSA.55.22	Smoother than butter was his speech, yet war was in his heart. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. 
PSA.55.23	Cast your burden on 
PSA.55.24	But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty, deceitful men will not live out half their days. But I—I will trust in You. 
PSA.56.1	For the music director: “A Silent Dove Far Away,” a Michtam of David, when the Philistines had seized him in Gath. 
PSA.56.2	Be gracious to me, O God! For man has crushed me, fighting all day he oppresses me. 
PSA.56.3	My foes trample me all day. For many are fighting me arrogantly. 
PSA.56.4	In a day when I am afraid, I will put my trust in You. 
PSA.56.5	In God—I keep praising His word— in God I trust, I will not fear. What can mere flesh do to me? 
PSA.56.6	All day they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil. 
PSA.56.7	They stir up strife; they lie hidden. They mark my steps, eager to take my soul. 
PSA.56.8	In spite of such sin, will they escape? In fierce anger, O God, cast down such people! 
PSA.56.9	You have recorded my wanderings. You put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book? 
PSA.56.10	Then my enemies will turn back in the day I call. This I know—that God is for me. 
PSA.56.11	In God—I keep praising His word— in 
PSA.56.12	in God I trust, I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 
PSA.56.13	I am under vows to You, O God. I will present thank offerings to You. 
PSA.56.14	For You have delivered my soul from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
PSA.57.1	For the music director, “Do Not Destroy,” a Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave. 
PSA.57.2	Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, for in You my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of Your wings I take refuge, until destruction passes by. 
PSA.57.3	I will cry out to 
PSA.57.4	He will send from heaven and save me. He rebukes the one trampling on me. Selah God is sending His mercy and His truth. 
PSA.57.5	My soul is in the midst of lions. I lie among those breathing fire— sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongue is a sharp sword. 
PSA.57.6	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let Your glory be over all the earth! 
PSA.57.7	They spread a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down. They have dug a pit before me— they fell into it themselves. Selah 
PSA.57.8	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will make music. 
PSA.57.9	Awake, my glory! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. 
PSA.57.10	I will praise You, my Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to You among the nations. 
PSA.57.11	For Your lovingkindness is great up to the heavens, and Your truth to the skies. 
PSA.57.12	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let Your glory be over all the earth! 
PSA.58.1	For the music director: “Do Not Destroy,” a Michtam of David. 
PSA.58.2	Do you really speak of justice, O “gods”? Do you judge with fairness, sons of man? 
PSA.58.3	No, in heart you devise injustice. Your hands weigh out violence on earth. 
PSA.58.4	The wicked are strangers from the womb. Speaking lies, they go astray from birth. 
PSA.58.5	Their venom is like a serpent’s venom, like a deaf cobra shutting its ear— 
PSA.58.6	not hearing the voice of charmers, or a cunning spell binder. 
PSA.58.7	O God, break their teeth in their mouths. Tear out the fangs of young lions, 
PSA.58.8	Let them flow away like water that runs off. When he bends his bow, let the arrows be cut off. 
PSA.58.9	Like a slug melting away as it slithers, like a woman’s miscarriage, may they never see the sun. 
PSA.58.10	Even before your pots can feel a thorn —whether alive or ablaze— He will sweep the wicked away. 
PSA.58.11	The righteous one will rejoice when he beholds vengeance, when he washes his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
PSA.58.12	Then men will say: “There really is a reward for the righteous. There really is a God who judges on earth!” 
PSA.59.1	For the music director: “Do Not Destroy,” a Michtam of David, when Saul sent men to watch the house to kill him. 
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from my enemies, my God! Set me on high, away from those who rise up against me. 
PSA.59.3	Deliver me from workers of iniquity. Rescue me from bloodthirsty men. 
PSA.59.4	For behold, they lie in wait for me. Defiant men stir up strife against me— not for my transgression or sin, 
PSA.59.5	For no guilt of mine, they run and set things up. Awake! Help me! Look! 
PSA.59.6	For You are 
PSA.59.7	They return at evening, snarling like a dog, prowling about the city. 
PSA.59.8	See, they are spewing with their mouth —swords in their lips— “After all, who is listening?” 
PSA.59.9	But You, 
PSA.59.10	O my strength, I watch for You— for God is my strong tower. 
PSA.59.11	My God in His lovingkindness will go before me. God will let me look down on my foes. 
PSA.59.12	Do not slay them, lest my people forget. With Your power shake them and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
PSA.59.13	The sin of their mouth is the words of their lips. So let them be caught in their pride, and for uttering a curse and a lie. 
PSA.59.14	Consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more. Let them know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah 
PSA.59.15	They return at evening, snarling like a dog, prowling about the city. 
PSA.59.16	They wander around for food. If they are not full, they stay up all night. 
PSA.59.17	But I—I sing of Your strength! Yes, in the morning I sing aloud of Your lovingkindness. For You have been my fortress, a refuge in the day of my trouble. 
PSA.59.18	O my strength, to You I sing praises. For God is my strong tower— my God of lovingkindness.
PSA.60.1	For the music director, on the “Lily of the Covenant,” a Michtam of David, for teaching, 
PSA.60.2	when he fought with Aram-Naharaim and with Aram-Zobah, and Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
PSA.60.3	O God, You have spurned us. You have broken out against us. You have been angry. Turn back to us! 
PSA.60.4	You made earth shake; You split it open. Heal its fractures—for it shudders. 
PSA.60.5	You made Your people see hardship. You made us drink wine of staggering. 
PSA.60.6	To those who fear You, You gave a banner, to be unfurled before the archers. Selah 
PSA.60.7	Save with Your right hand and answer us, so that Your beloved may be delivered. 
PSA.60.8	God has spoken in His holiness: “I will exult! I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the valley of Succoth. 
PSA.60.9	Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine, Ephraim is a helmet for my head, Judah is my scepter. 
PSA.60.10	Moab is my washbasin, On Edom I toss my sandal, Philistia, cry aloud because of me!” 
PSA.60.11	Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
PSA.60.12	Should it not be You, O God— who spurned us and no longer goes out with our armies? 
PSA.60.13	Give us aid against the adversary, for the help of man is worthless. 
PSA.60.14	With God we will do mighty things, and He will trample our foes.
PSA.61.1	For the music director, on string instrument, of David. 
PSA.61.2	Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer. 
PSA.61.3	From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
PSA.61.4	For You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength before the enemy. 
PSA.61.5	Let me dwell in Your tent forever. Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah 
PSA.61.6	For You have heard my vows, O God. You have given the inheritance of those who fear Your Name. 
PSA.61.7	May You add days to the king’s days. May his years span many generations. 
PSA.61.8	May he be enthroned before God forever. Appoint mercy and truth to protect him. 
PSA.61.9	So I will sing praise to Your Name forever, to fulfill my vows day after day. 
PSA.62.1	For the music director, on Jeduthun. A psalm of David. 
PSA.62.2	My soul, wait in stillness, only for God— from Him comes my salvation. 
PSA.62.3	He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress—I will never be moved. 
PSA.62.4	How long will all of you assault a man, to crush him, like a leaning wall, a fence to be torn down? 
PSA.62.5	They only plot to topple him from his rank. Delighting in falsehood, they bless with their mouth, but inwardly they curse. Selah 
PSA.62.6	My soul, wait in stillness, only for God— for from Him comes my expectation. 
PSA.62.7	He alone is my rock and my salvation, my strong tower—I will not be moved. 
PSA.62.8	On God, my salvation and my glory is the rock of my strength. My refuge is in God. 
PSA.62.9	Trust in Him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart in His presence. God is our refuge. Selah 
PSA.62.10	Sons of Adam are a vapor, sons of man are an illusion. In balanced scales they go up— altogether they are less than a breath. 
PSA.62.11	Do not trust in extortion, and do not put vain hope in plunder. Though these things increase riches, do not set your heart on them. 
PSA.62.12	Once God has spoken, twice I have heard this: might belongs to God. 
PSA.62.13	Also Yours, O Lord, is lovingkindness. For You reward a man for his work.
PSA.63.1	A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. 
PSA.63.2	O God, You are my God, earnestly I seek You. My soul thirsts for You. My flesh longs for You in a dry and weary land, where there is no water. 
PSA.63.3	So, I looked for You in the Sanctuary, to see Your power and Your glory. 
PSA.63.4	Since Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips will praise You. 
PSA.63.5	So I will bless You as long as I live. In Your name I lift up my hands. 
PSA.63.6	My soul is satisfied as with fat and oil, so my mouth praises You with joyful lips. 
PSA.63.7	When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You through the night watches. 
PSA.63.8	For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy. 
PSA.63.9	My soul clings to You— Your right hand upholds me. 
PSA.63.10	But those who seek my soul to destroy it will go down to the depths of the earth. 
PSA.63.11	They will be gutted by the sword, and become a prey for jackals. 
PSA.63.12	But the king will rejoice in God. All who swear by Him will boast, when the mouth speaking lies is shut.
PSA.64.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. 
PSA.64.2	Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint. Protect my life from terror of the enemy. 
PSA.64.3	Hide me from the conspiracy of evildoers, from the tumult of workers of iniquity, 
PSA.64.4	who sharpened their tongue like a sword, and aimed their arrow—bitter words, 
PSA.64.5	to shoot from hiding at the innocent, shooting suddenly at him, with no fear. 
PSA.64.6	They are firming up their evil plan. They talk about setting secret traps. They asked, “Who would see them?” 
PSA.64.7	They are plotting injustices: “We have completed a perfect plot!” A man’s inward part and heart are deep. 
PSA.64.8	But God will shoot them with an arrow— suddenly their wounds will appear. 
PSA.64.9	So their tongue will be their downfall. All who see them will flee away. 
PSA.64.10	Then all men will fear. So they will declare the work of God, and ponder what He has done. 
PSA.64.11	The righteous will be glad in 
PSA.65.1	For the music director, a psalm, a song of David. 
PSA.65.2	Praise is awaiting You in Zion, O God, and to You the vow will be fulfilled. 
PSA.65.3	O You who hear prayer, to You all flesh will come. 
PSA.65.4	Records of sins overwhelm me— You will atone for our transgressions. 
PSA.65.5	Blessed is the one You choose and bring near to dwell in Your courts! We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your House—Your holy Temple. 
PSA.65.6	You respond to us in righteousness with awe-inspiring works —O God of our salvation— hope of all ends of the earth and farthest seas, 
PSA.65.7	who establishes mountains by His power, being girded with might, 
PSA.65.8	who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples. 
PSA.65.9	Those dwelling in the uttermost parts stand in awe of Your signs. You make morning and evening shout for joy. 
PSA.65.10	You visit the land and make it abundant, greatly enriching it— the stream of God is full of water. You prepare their grain, for so You have prepared the earth. 
PSA.65.11	You drench her furrows, leveling the ridges. You soften her with showers, blessing her growth. 
PSA.65.12	You crown the year with Your goodness. Your wagon tracks drip with abundance. 
PSA.65.13	Pastures of the wilderness overflow and hills are robed with joy. 
PSA.65.14	Meadows are clothed with flocks and valleys are covered with grain— they shout for joy, yes, they sing!
PSA.66.1	For the music director, a song, a psalm. Shout joyfully to God, all the earth! 
PSA.66.2	Sing the glory of His Name— make His praise glorious. 
PSA.66.3	Say to God: “How awesome are Your deeds! Because of Your great power, Your enemies cringe before You. 
PSA.66.4	All the earth bows down to You, and sings praises to You. All sing praises to Your Name.” Selah 
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God. How awesome His deeds for the children of Adam! 
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land. They crossed the river on foot. There let us rejoice in Him! 
PSA.66.7	He rules by His might forever. His eyes keep watch on the nations. Let no rebels exalt themselves. Selah 
PSA.66.8	Bless our God, O peoples! Let the sound of His praise be heard. 
PSA.66.9	Keeping our soul in life, He has not let our foot slip. 
PSA.66.10	For You have tested us, O God— You have purified us, as silver is refined. 
PSA.66.11	You brought us into a net. You laid a burden on our backs. 
PSA.66.12	You caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and water. Yet You brought us out to superabundance. 
PSA.66.13	With burnt offerings I will come to Your House, fulfilling my vows to You 
PSA.66.14	that my lips uttered and mouth spoke, when I was in trouble. 
PSA.66.15	To You I will present burnt offerings of fat animals, with the sweet smoke of rams. I will offer bulls with goats. Selah 
PSA.66.16	Come and listen, all you who fear God. I will tell what He has done for my soul. 
PSA.66.17	I cried out to Him with my mouth, and exaltation was on my tongue. 
PSA.66.18	If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. 
PSA.66.19	But surely God has heard. He has listened to my voice in prayer. 
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor His lovingkindness from me.
PSA.67.1	For the music director, with stringed instruments, a psalm, a song. 
PSA.67.2	May God be gracious to us and bless us. May He cause His face to shine upon us— Selah 
PSA.67.3	so that Your way may be known on earth, and Your salvation among all nations. 
PSA.67.4	Let the peoples praise You, O God. Let all the peoples praise You. 
PSA.67.5	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for You will judge the peoples fairly, and guide the nations on the earth. Selah 
PSA.67.6	Let the peoples praise You, O God. Let all the peoples praise You. 
PSA.67.7	The earth has yielded its harvest— God, our God will bless us. 
PSA.67.8	God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will fear Him. 
PSA.68.1	For the music director, a psalm of David, a song. 
PSA.68.2	Let God arise! Let His enemies be scattered! Let those who hate Him flee before Him. 
PSA.68.3	As smoke is blown away, may You blow them away. As wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God. 
PSA.68.4	But let the righteous be glad. Let them exult before God. Let them rejoice with gladness. 
PSA.68.5	Sing to God, sing praises to His Name. Prepare the road for Him who rides through the deserts, whose Name is 
PSA.68.6	A father of orphans, defender of widows, is God in His holy dwelling. 
PSA.68.7	God settles the lonely in a home. He leads prisoners out to prosperity. But the rebellious live in a parched land. 
PSA.68.8	O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the desert—Selah— 
PSA.68.9	the earth shook, the heavens rained at the presence of God —the One of Sinai— at the presence of God, God of Israel. 
PSA.68.10	You poured down abundant rain, O God. You sustained Your weary inheritance. 
PSA.68.11	Your community settled in it. In Your goodness, O God, You provided for the poor. 
PSA.68.12	The Lord gives the word— a great company of women proclaims the good news. 
PSA.68.13	“Kings of armies, flee, flee!” She who stays at home divides the spoil. 
PSA.68.14	When you lie among the campfires, wings of a dove were covered with silver and her feathers with shimmering gold. 
PSA.68.15	When 
PSA.68.16	Mount Bashan is a mountain of God. Mount Bashan is a mountain of peaks. 
PSA.68.17	Why do you gaze with envy, you mountain peaks, at the mountain God desired for His dwelling? Yes, 
PSA.68.18	The chariots of God are thousands and thousands —my Lord is among them as at Sinai, in holiness. 
PSA.68.19	You went up on high. You led captivity captive. You received gifts from humanity, even from the rebellious— so that God might dwell there. 
PSA.68.20	Blessed be my Lord! Day by day He bears our burdens— the God of our salvation! Selah 
PSA.68.21	God is for us—a God of deliverance. 
PSA.68.22	Surely God crushes the head of His foes, the hairy scalp of one walking in his guilt. 
PSA.68.23	My Lord said: “I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea. 
PSA.68.24	So your foot may wade in blood, and your dogs’ tongue may have their share of your enemies’ blood.” 
PSA.68.25	They have seen Your processions, O God— the processions of my God, my King, into the Sanctuary: 
PSA.68.26	The singers go before, the musicians last, between maidens beating tambourines. 
PSA.68.27	“Bless God in the congregations— 
PSA.68.28	There Benjamin, the youngest, is leading them, there the throng of Judah’s princes, there the princes of Zebulun, there the princes of Naphtali. 
PSA.68.29	Your God commanded your strength. Strengthen, O God, You who have acted for us. 
PSA.68.30	From Your Temple above Jerusalem, kings bring You tribute. 
PSA.68.31	Rebuke the beast of the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves, peoples trampling down pieces of silver. He has scattered the peoples who delight in war! 
PSA.68.32	Nobles come from Egypt. Cush runs to stretch her hands to God. 
PSA.68.33	Sing to God, kingdoms of the earth, sing praises to the Lord—Selah— 
PSA.68.34	to Him who rides upon the ancient heavens of heavens. Look, He utters His voice, a mighty voice! 
PSA.68.35	Ascribe strength to God— His majesty is over Israel and His strength is in the skies. 
PSA.68.36	O God, You are awesome from Your holy places. The God of Israel gives strength and power to the people. Blessed be God!
PSA.69.1	For the music director, on “Lilies,” of David. 
PSA.69.2	Save me, O God, for the waters have reached my soul. 
PSA.69.3	I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no footing, I have come into deep waters, and a flood sweeps over me. 
PSA.69.4	I am worn out by my crying, my throat is parched, my eyes fail, waiting for my God. 
PSA.69.5	Those who hate me without a cause outnumber the hairs of my head. Powerful are my enemies who would destroy me with lies. What I did not steal, must I restore? 
PSA.69.6	O God, You know my folly, nor are my trespasses hidden from You. 
PSA.69.7	May those who hope in You not be ashamed because of me, my Lord, 
PSA.69.8	For I have endured scorn for Your sake. Disgrace has covered my face. 
PSA.69.9	I have become a stranger to my brothers, a foreigner to my mother’s children. 
PSA.69.10	For zeal for Your House consumed me— the insults of those who insulted You have fallen on me. 
PSA.69.11	When I wept and fasted— that became a reproach to me. 
PSA.69.12	When I put on sackcloth, I became a joke to them. 
PSA.69.13	Those who sit at the gate chatter about me, and I am the song of the drunkards. 
PSA.69.14	But as for me, my prayer to You, 
PSA.69.15	Deliver me from the mire— do not let me sink. Deliver me from those who hate me, out of the deep waters. 
PSA.69.16	Do not let floodwaters sweep over me, nor the deep swallow me up, nor the Pit shut its mouth over me. 
PSA.69.17	Answer me, 
PSA.69.18	Hide not Your face from Your servant. For I am in distress—answer me quickly. 
PSA.69.19	Draw near to my soul and redeem it. Ransom me because of my foes. 
PSA.69.20	You know my reproach, my shame, my disgrace. All my adversaries are before You. 
PSA.69.21	Scorn has broken my heart, so I am sick. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but found none. 
PSA.69.22	They put gall in my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
PSA.69.23	Let their table before them be a snare, and what should have been for their well-being, let it be a trap. 
PSA.69.24	Let their eyes be darkened so they cannot see and their backs be bent forever. 
PSA.69.25	Pour out Your indignation on them. Let Your fierce anger overtake them. 
PSA.69.26	Let their encampment be deserted. Let none dwell in their tents. 
PSA.69.27	For they persecute the one You have smitten, so they tell of the pain of those You have wounded. 
PSA.69.28	Add guilt to their guilt—may they not come into Your righteousness. 
PSA.69.29	May they be wiped out of the book of life and not be recorded with the righteous. 
PSA.69.30	But I—I am afflicted and in pain. Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
PSA.69.31	I will praise God’s Name with a song, and magnify Him with praise. 
PSA.69.32	It will please 
PSA.69.33	The humble will see it and be glad. You who seek God, let your hearts revive. 
PSA.69.34	For 
PSA.69.35	Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything moving in them. 
PSA.69.36	For God will save Zion, and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then they will dwell there and possess it. 
PSA.69.37	The children of His servants will inherit it and those who love His Name will dwell there. 
PSA.70.1	For the music director, of David, for a memorial. 
PSA.70.2	O God, come quickly to deliver me, 
PSA.70.3	May they be put to shame and disgrace who seek my life. May they be turned back in humiliation who delight in my hurt. 
PSA.70.4	May those who say, “Aha! Aha!” be turned away because of their shame. 
PSA.70.5	But may all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You. May those who love Your salvation always say, “Let God be magnified.” 
PSA.70.6	But I am poor and needy— God, come quickly to me. You are my help and my deliverer— 
PSA.71.1	In You, 
PSA.71.2	Deliver me and rescue me in Your justice. Turn Your ear to me and save me. 
PSA.71.3	Be to me a sheltering rock where I may always go. Give the command to save me— for You are my rock and my fortress. 
PSA.71.4	My God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of an evil, ruthless man. 
PSA.71.5	For You are my hope, 
PSA.71.6	From my birth I have leaned on You. You took me out of my mother’s womb. My praise is always about You. 
PSA.71.7	I am like an ominous sign to many, but You are my strong refuge. 
PSA.71.8	My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your glory all day. 
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me away in the time of old age. When my strength fails, do not forsake me. 
PSA.71.10	For my enemies speak against me. Those who watch for my soul conspire together, 
PSA.71.11	saying: “God has forsaken him— Pursue and take him, for no one will deliver.” 
PSA.71.12	O God, be not far from me! My God, come quickly to help me. 
PSA.71.13	Let the accusers of my soul be disgraced and destroyed. Let those who seek to harm me be covered with scorn and confusion. 
PSA.71.14	But I—I will hope continually and will praise You more and more. 
PSA.71.15	My mouth will recount Your justice and Your salvation all day, though I do not know the sum of them. 
PSA.71.16	I come because of the mighty deeds of 
PSA.71.17	God, You taught me from my youth, and I still keep declaring Your wonders. 
PSA.71.18	So even until I am old and gray, O God, do not forsake me, till I tell of Your strong arm to the next generation, Your might to all who are to come. 
PSA.71.19	For Your righteousness, O God, reaches to high heaven. You have done great things— O God, who is like You? 
PSA.71.20	You made me see many troubles and evils —You will revive me again— from the depths of the earth You will bring me up again. 
PSA.71.21	You will increase my greatness, and comfort me once again. 
PSA.71.22	So I will praise You with the harp for your truth, O my God. I will sing praises to You with the lyre O Holy One of Israel. 
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout for joy —when I sing praises to You— and my soul, which You have redeemed. 
PSA.71.24	Also my tongue will tell of Your righteousness all day. For those who seek my hurt have been put to shame and confusion. 
PSA.72.1	Of Solomon. Give the king Your judgments, O God, and Your righteousness to the king’s son. 
PSA.72.2	May he judge Your people with righteousness, and Your poor ones with justice. 
PSA.72.3	Let the mountains bring 
PSA.72.4	May he vindicate the poor of the people, save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor. 
PSA.72.5	Let them fear You while the sun endures, and while the moon lasts, throughout all generations. 
PSA.72.6	May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the ground. 
PSA.72.7	Let the righteous flourish in his days. Let 
PSA.72.8	May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.72.9	Let desert dwellers bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust. 
PSA.72.10	May kings of Tarshish and the islands bring tribute, kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts. 
PSA.72.11	So let all kings bow down before him, and all nations serve him. 
PSA.72.12	For he rescues the needy crying for help, also the poor and the one with no helper. 
PSA.72.13	He will take pity on the poor and needy, and the souls of the needy he will save. 
PSA.72.14	From oppression and violence he redeems their soul, for precious is their blood in his sight. 
PSA.72.15	Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given to him. May he pray for him continually, and bless him all day. 
PSA.72.16	Let there be abundance of grain in the land. Let it sway on the top of the hills, let its fruit be like Lebanon, and let people of the city flourish like grass of the field. 
PSA.72.17	May his name endure forever. May his name increase before the sun, and may all nations be blessed by him and call him blessed. 
PSA.72.18	Blessed be 
PSA.72.19	Blessed be His glorious Name forever. May all the earth be filled with His glory! 
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David son of Jesse are complete. 
PSA.73.1	A psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to the pure in heart. 
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet almost slipped. My steps nearly slid out from under me. 
PSA.73.3	For I envied the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
PSA.73.4	For there are no pains at their death, their body is healthy. 
PSA.73.5	They have none of humanity’s trouble, nor are they plagued like others. 
PSA.73.6	Therefore, they put on pride as a necklace, and violence wraps around them like a garment. 
PSA.73.7	Their eyes bulge out from fatness. The imaginations of their hearts run wild. 
PSA.73.8	They scoff and wickedly plan evil. From on high they threaten. 
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against heaven. Their tongue struts through the earth. 
PSA.73.10	Therefore His people return here, while they drink their fill. 
PSA.73.11	So they say: “How does God know? And does Elyon have knowledge?” 
PSA.73.12	Behold, such are the wicked— always at ease and amassing wealth. 
PSA.73.13	Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence. 
PSA.73.14	For all day I have been stricken, my chastisement comes every morning. 
PSA.73.15	If I had said: “I will speak thus,” surely I would have betrayed a generation of Your children. 
PSA.73.16	But when I tried to make sense of this, it was troubling in my eyes— 
PSA.73.17	until I entered the Sanctuary of God, and perceived their end. 
PSA.73.18	Surely You put them in slippery places. You hurled them down to destruction. 
PSA.73.19	How suddenly they became a ruin— terminated, consumed by terrors. 
PSA.73.20	Like a dream when one awakes, thus when You arise, my Lord, You will despise their form. 
PSA.73.21	When my heart was embittered and I was pierced in my heart, 
PSA.73.22	I was brutish and ignorant. I was like a beast before You. 
PSA.73.23	Yet I am continually with You. You hold my right hand. 
PSA.73.24	You guide me with Your counsel, and afterward You will take me into glory. 
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but You? On earth there is none I desire besides You. 
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 
PSA.73.27	For behold, those far from You will perish. You put an end to all who like a harlot are unfaithful to You. 
PSA.73.28	But for me, it is good to be near God. I have made my Lord 
PSA.74.1	A contemplative song of Asaph. Why have You cast us off forever, O God? Why does Your anger smolder against the flock of Your pasture? 
PSA.74.2	Remember Your congregation, which You purchased of old, redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance, and Mount Zion, where You dwelt. 
PSA.74.3	Lift Your steps toward the perpetual ruins— an enemy has done all evil to the Sanctuary! 
PSA.74.4	Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place. They have set up their standards as signs. 
PSA.74.5	It seemed like bringing up axes into a thicket of trees— 
PSA.74.6	and now all its carved work they smash with hatchet and hammers! 
PSA.74.7	They set Your Sanctuary on fire, burning it to the ground. They defiled the dwelling place of Your Name. 
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts: “Let us crush them totally!” They burned down all the meeting places of God in the land. 
PSA.74.9	We do not see our signs. No longer is there any prophet— and no one among us knows how long. 
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, will the adversary mock? Will the enemy revile Your Name forever? 
PSA.74.11	Why do You hold back Your hand, Your right hand? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them! 
PSA.74.12	Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the land. 
PSA.74.13	You split the sea with Your power. You smashed the monsters’ heads in the waters. 
PSA.74.14	You crushed the heads of Leviathan, giving him as food to the desert dwellers. 
PSA.74.15	You opened up spring and brook. You dried up ever-flowing rivers. 
PSA.74.16	The day is Yours, the night also is Yours. You provided moon and sun. 
PSA.74.17	You set all the borders of earth. You made summer and winter. 
PSA.74.18	Remember how the enemy mocked, 
PSA.74.19	Do not deliver Your turtledove’s soul to the wild beast. Do not forget the life of Your afflicted ones forever. 
PSA.74.20	Look upon the covenant— for haunts of violence fill the dark places of earth. 
PSA.74.21	Do not let the oppressed turn back in shame. But let the poor and needy praise Your Name. 
PSA.74.22	Rise up O God, and defend Your cause. Remember how the fool mocks You all day. 
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the noise of Your foes, the uproar of those rising up against You, ascending continually.
PSA.75.1	For the music director: “Do not Destroy,” a psalm of Asaph, a song. 
PSA.75.2	We praise You, we praise God, for Your Name is near. People declare Your wonders. 
PSA.75.3	“When I appoint a set time, I Myself will judge uprightly. 
PSA.75.4	When the earth wavers with living on it, I Myself hold its pillars firm. Selah 
PSA.75.5	I say to the arrogant, ‘No more boasting!’ And to the wicked, ‘Do not be lifting up your horn.’ 
PSA.75.6	Do not lift your horn up high. Do not speak with outstretched neck.” 
PSA.75.7	For exaltation comes not from the east nor from the west, nor even from the desert. 
PSA.75.8	For God is the Judge: He lowers one and lifts up another. 
PSA.75.9	For in the hand of 
PSA.75.10	But I—I will declare it forever, I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
PSA.75.11	I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
PSA.76.1	For the music director, on stringed instruments: a psalm of Asaph, a song. 
PSA.76.2	In Judah God is known. In Israel His Name is great. 
PSA.76.3	In Salem is His 
PSA.76.4	There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the battle. Selah 
PSA.76.5	You are brilliant, more majestic than nourishing mountains. 
PSA.76.6	The valiant have been plundered— they slumbered in their sleep. The mighty could not lift their hands. 
PSA.76.7	At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lay dead asleep. 
PSA.76.8	You are awesome, yes You are! Who can stand in Your presence once You are angry? 
PSA.76.9	From heaven You pronounced judgment. The earth feared and was still— 
PSA.76.10	when God rose up to judgment, to save all the humble of the land. Selah 
PSA.76.11	For wrath upon man will bring You praise, a remnant of wrath You put on as a belt. 
PSA.76.12	Make vows to 
PSA.76.13	He cuts off the breath of princes. The kings of earth are in awe of Him.
PSA.77.1	For the music director, on Jeduthun: a psalm of Asaph. 
PSA.77.2	My voice to God—and I cried out, my voice to God—and He heard me! 
PSA.77.3	In the day of my trouble I seek my Lord. At night my hand stretches out untiringly. My soul refuses to be comforted. 
PSA.77.4	I remember God and I moan. I muse, and my spirit grows faint. Selah 
PSA.77.5	You hold my eyelids open— I am so troubled—I cannot speak. 
PSA.77.6	I ponder the days of old, the years long ago. 
PSA.77.7	In the night I remember my song. I meditate with my heart and my spirit is searching. 
PSA.77.8	“Will the Lord reject forever and never again show favor? 
PSA.77.9	Has His mercy vanished forever? Has His promise come to an end forever? 
PSA.77.10	Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or has He in anger withdrawn his mercies?” Selah 
PSA.77.11	Then I said: “It wounds me— that the right hand of Elyon has changed.” 
PSA.77.12	I will remember the deeds of 
PSA.77.13	I will meditate also on all Your work and consider Your deeds.” 
PSA.77.14	O God, Your way is holy. What god is great like God? 
PSA.77.15	You are the God who works wonders. You have made Your power known among the peoples. 
PSA.77.16	With your arm You redeemed Your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 
PSA.77.17	The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You and writhed, even the depths shook. 
PSA.77.18	The clouds poured out water, the skies resounded, Your arrows flashed back and forth. 
PSA.77.19	The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind. Lightning lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook. 
PSA.77.20	Your way was in the sea, and Your path in the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not seen. 
PSA.77.21	You led Your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	A contemplative song of Asaph. Listen, my people, to my teaching. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth. 
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth with a parable. I will utter perplexing sayings from of old, 
PSA.78.3	which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children, telling to the next generation the praises of 
PSA.78.5	For He established a testimony in Jacob and ordained 
PSA.78.6	so that the next generation might know, even the children yet to be born: they will arise and tell their children. 
PSA.78.7	Then they will put their trust in God, not forgetting the works of God, but keeping His 
PSA.78.8	So they will not be like their fathers— a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not prepare its heart, whose spirit was not loyal to God. 
PSA.78.9	The sons of Ephraim were archers armed with bows, yet they turned back in the day of battle. 
PSA.78.10	They did not keep God’s covenant and refused to walk in His 
PSA.78.11	They forgot His deeds and His wonders that He had shown them. 
PSA.78.12	He did miracles in front of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Zoan. 
PSA.78.13	He split the sea and led them through, and He made the water stand like a wall. 
PSA.78.14	By day He led them with a cloud and all night with a light of fire. 
PSA.78.15	He split apart rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the depths. 
PSA.78.16	So He brought streams out of a rock, and made waters flow down like rivers. 
PSA.78.17	Yet they added more sinning against Him, rebelling against Elyon in the desert. 
PSA.78.18	They put God to the test in their heart by demanding food for their craving. 
PSA.78.19	Then they spoke against God, saying, “Can God set a table in the wilderness? 
PSA.78.20	See, He struck the rock, waters gushed out, streams overflowed. But can He give bread? Will He provide meat for His people?” 
PSA.78.21	When 
PSA.78.22	For they did not believe in God or trust in His salvation. 
PSA.78.23	Yet He commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven, 
PSA.78.24	and rained down 
PSA.78.25	Man did eat the bread of angels. He sent them abundant provision. 
PSA.78.26	He loosed the east wind in the skies, and by His power He drove the south wind. 
PSA.78.27	He rained meat upon them like dust, and winged fowl like sand of the seas. 
PSA.78.28	And He let it fall amidst their camp, all around their tents. 
PSA.78.29	So they ate and were very full— for He gave them their desire. 
PSA.78.30	No longer a stranger from their desire, while their food was still in their mouths, 
PSA.78.31	the anger of God rose against them and slew the stoutest of them, and struck down young men of Israel. 
PSA.78.32	Despite all this they sinned still more, and did not trust in His wonders. 
PSA.78.33	So He ended their days in futility and their years in terror. 
PSA.78.34	But when He slew them, then they sought Him, and turned back, and desired God eagerly. 
PSA.78.35	Then they remembered that God was their Rock and 
PSA.78.36	But they flattered Him with their mouth and kept lying to Him with their tongue. 
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not steadfast with Him, nor were they faithful to His covenant. 
PSA.78.38	But He is compassionate, forgives iniquity and does not destroy. Yes, many times He restrains His anger, and does not stir up all His wrath. 
PSA.78.39	For He remembered that they are but flesh, a passing breath that never returns. 
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert! 
PSA.78.41	Again and again they tested God, and pained the Holy One of Israel. 
PSA.78.42	They did not remember His hand— the day He redeemed them from the foe, 
PSA.78.43	when He displayed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the plain of Zoan. 
PSA.78.44	He turned their rivers into blood, so they could not drink from their streams. 
PSA.78.45	He sent on them flies to devour them, and frogs to devastate them, 
PSA.78.46	and gave their crops to the grasshopper, and their labor to the locust. 
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost, 
PSA.78.48	and gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts. 
PSA.78.49	He sent on them the fury of His anger —wrath and indignation and trouble— a band of evil angels. 
PSA.78.50	He cleared a path for His anger. He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague. 
PSA.78.51	He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. 
PSA.78.52	But He brought His people out like sheep, and led them in the wilderness like a flock. 
PSA.78.53	He led them to safety, so they did not fear, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
PSA.78.54	Then He brought them to His holy territory, to the mountain His right hand had gotten. 
PSA.78.55	He drove out nations before them, and allotted them an inheritance. He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
PSA.78.56	Yet they tested and rebelled against 
PSA.78.57	Like their fathers they turned and were treacherous. They turned aside like a faulty bow. 
PSA.78.58	For they provoked Him with their high places, so they aroused His jealousy with their graven images. 
PSA.78.59	God heard and was furious, and He greatly detested Israel. 
PSA.78.60	He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent He pitched among men. 
PSA.78.61	He gave up His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary’s hand. 
PSA.78.62	He gave His people over to the sword, when He was angry at His inheritance. 
PSA.78.63	Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins had no wedding songs. 
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep. 
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a warrior shaking off wine. 
PSA.78.66	He beat back His foes, putting them to lasting scorn. 
PSA.78.67	Then He detested Joseph’s tent and chose not the tribe of Ephraim. 
PSA.78.68	Instead He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved. 
PSA.78.69	He built His Sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that He established forever. 
PSA.78.70	He also chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds, 
PSA.78.71	from following nursing ewes. He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance. 
PSA.78.72	So He shepherded them with the integrity of His heart, and led them with His skillful hands.
PSA.79.1	A Psalm of Asaph. God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, defiled Your holy Temple, and reduced Jerusalem to ruins. 
PSA.79.2	They gave the carcasses of Your servants as food to the birds of the skies, the flesh of Your 
PSA.79.3	They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. 
PSA.79.4	We have become a taunt to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us. 
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.6	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name. 
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his country. 
PSA.79.8	Do not hold against us the sins of our fathers. May Your mercies come quickly to meet us, for we are brought very low. 
PSA.79.9	Help us, God of our salvation— for the sake of the glory of Your Name. Deliver us, and atone for our sins— for Your name’s sake. 
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say: “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, let it be known among the nations that You avenge the shed blood of Your servants. 
PSA.79.11	Let the prisoner’s groan come to You. By Your great arm preserve those who are doomed to die. 
PSA.79.12	Pay back into the midst of our neighbors sevenfold their reproach— the reproach they hurled at You, my Lord. 
PSA.79.13	So we, Your people, the flock of Your pasture, will praise You forever. From generation to generation we will recount Your praise.
PSA.80.1	For the music director, on “Lilies,” a testimony: a psalm of Asaph. 
PSA.80.2	Give ear, Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock. You who are enthroned upon the 
PSA.80.3	Before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your might, and come to save us. 
PSA.80.4	O God, restore us, make Your face shine, and we will be saved. 
PSA.80.5	, how long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people? 
PSA.80.6	You have fed them the bread of tears and made them drink a measure of tears. 
PSA.80.7	You make us a contention to our neighbors, and our enemies mock as they please. 
PSA.80.8	, restore us, and make Your face shine, and we will be saved. 
PSA.80.9	You pulled out a vine from Egypt. You drove out nations and planted it. 
PSA.80.10	You cleared a place for it, and it took deep root and filled the land. 
PSA.80.11	The mountains were covered by its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. 
PSA.80.12	It sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the river. 
PSA.80.13	Why have You broken down its fences, so all who pass by the way pick its fruit? 
PSA.80.14	A boar from the forest ravages it, whatever moves in the field feeds on it. 
PSA.80.15	, please return! Look down from heaven and see! Now take care of this vine— 
PSA.80.16	the shoot Your right hand planted— the son You strengthened for Yourself. 
PSA.80.17	It is burned with fire, it is cut down. They perish from the rebuke of Your face. 
PSA.80.18	Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand—the son of man You made strong for Yourself. 
PSA.80.19	Then we will not turn away from You. Revive us, and we will call on Your Name. 
PSA.80.20	, restore us. Make Your face shine, and we will be saved.
PSA.81.1	For the music director, on the Gittite lyre, of Asaph. 
PSA.81.2	Sing for joy to God our strength, shout to the God of Jacob! 
PSA.81.3	Lift up a song and sound a tambourine, a sweet lyre with a harp. 
PSA.81.4	Blow the 
PSA.81.5	For it is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 
PSA.81.6	He set it up as a testimony in Joseph, when He went throughout the land of Egypt, I heard a language I did not understand. 
PSA.81.7	“I relieved his shoulder of the burden, his hands were set free from the basket. 
PSA.81.8	You called out in trouble, and I rescued you. I answered you from the hiding place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah 
PSA.81.9	Hear, My people, I will admonish you— if you would listen to Me, O Israel! 
PSA.81.10	Let there be no foreign god among you, and you shall not worship any alien god. 
PSA.81.11	I am 
PSA.81.12	But My people did not listen to My voice. Israel was not willing to be Mine. 
PSA.81.13	So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart, to walk in their own counsels. 
PSA.81.14	Oh that My people would listen to Me, that Israel would walk in My ways! 
PSA.81.15	I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their foes. 
PSA.81.16	Those who hate 
PSA.81.17	But you would be fed with the finest wheat, with honey out of a rock would I satisfy you.”
PSA.82.1	A psalm of Asaph. God takes His stand in the assembly of God. He judges among the ‘gods’: 
PSA.82.2	“How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 
PSA.82.3	Give justice to the poor and fatherless. Be just to the afflicted and destitute. 
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. 
PSA.82.5	They know nothing; they understand nothing— they walk about in darkness. All of earth’s foundations are shaken. 
PSA.82.6	I said: ‘You are ‘gods’, and you are all sons of Elyon, 
PSA.82.7	yet you will die like men, and will fall like any of the princes.’” 
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth! For You possess all the nations.
PSA.83.1	A song: a psalm of Asaph. 
PSA.83.2	God, do not keep silent. Do not hold Your peace, O God. Do not be still. 
PSA.83.3	For look, Your enemies make an uproar. Those who hate You lift up their head. 
PSA.83.4	They make a shrewd plot against Your people, conspiring against Your treasured ones. 
PSA.83.5	“Come,” they say, “let’s wipe them out as a nation! Let Israel’s name be remembered no more!” 
PSA.83.6	For with one mind they plot together. Against You do they make a covenant. 
PSA.83.7	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 
PSA.83.8	Gebal, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre, 
PSA.83.9	even Assyria has joined them, becoming a strong arm for Lot’s sons. Selah 
PSA.83.10	Do to them as You did to Midian, to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River, 
PSA.83.11	who perished at En-dor— they became as dung for the ground. 
PSA.83.12	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb— all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 
PSA.83.13	who said, “Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God.” 
PSA.83.14	My God, make them like tumbleweed, like chaff before the wind. 
PSA.83.15	As a fire burns a forest, and as a flame sets mountains ablaze, 
PSA.83.16	so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm. 
PSA.83.17	Cover their faces with shame, so they may seek Your Name—
PSA.83.18	Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever. Let them be humiliated and perish. 
PSA.83.19	Let them know that You alone —whose Name is 
PSA.84.1	For the music director, upon the Gittite lyre, a psalm of the sons of Korah. 
PSA.84.2	How lovely are Your tabernacles, 
PSA.84.3	My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of 
PSA.84.4	Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young —near Your altars, 
PSA.84.5	Blessed are they who dwell in Your House —they are ever praising You. Selah 
PSA.84.6	Blessed is one whose strength is in You, in whose heart are the pilgrim roads. 
PSA.84.7	Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a spring. The early rain covers it with blessings. 
PSA.84.8	They go from strength to strength— every one of them appears before God in Zion. 
PSA.84.9	, hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah 
PSA.84.10	O God, look at our shield, and look upon the face of Your anointed. 
PSA.84.11	For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand anywhere else. I would rather stand at the threshold of the House of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
PSA.84.12	For 
PSA.84.13	, blessed is the one who trusts in You.
PSA.85.1	For the music director, a psalm of the sons of Korah. 
PSA.85.2	, will you favor Your land? Will You restore Jacob from captivity? 
PSA.85.3	Will You bear away Your people’s iniquity, Will You pardon all their sin? Selah 
PSA.85.4	Will You withdraw all Your wrath? Will You turn from Your burning anger? 
PSA.85.5	Restore us, O God of our salvation, and renounce Your indignation with us. 
PSA.85.6	Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger from generation to generation? 
PSA.85.7	Will You not revive us again, so Your people may rejoice in You? 
PSA.85.8	Show us Your mercy, 
PSA.85.9	Let me hear what God 
PSA.85.10	Surely His salvation is near those who fear Him, so that glory may dwell in our land. 
PSA.85.11	Lovingkindness and truth meet together. Righteousness and 
PSA.85.12	Truth will spring up from the earth, and justice will look down from heaven. 
PSA.85.13	Yes, 
PSA.85.14	Righteousness is going before Him and prepares a way for His feet. 
PSA.86.1	A prayer of David. Turn Your ear, 
PSA.86.2	Watch over my soul, for I am godly. You are my God— save Your servant who trusts in You. 
PSA.86.3	Be gracious to me, my Lord, for to You I cry all day. 
PSA.86.4	Gladden the soul of Your servant, for to You, my Lord, I lift up my soul. 
PSA.86.5	For You, my Lord, are good, and ready to forgive and full of mercy to all who call upon You. 
PSA.86.6	Give ear, 
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I call upon You, for You will answer me. 
PSA.86.8	There is none like You among the gods, my Lord, there are no deeds like Yours. 
PSA.86.9	All nations You have made will come and bow down before You, my Lord, and they will glorify Your Name. 
PSA.86.10	For You are great, and do wonders— You alone are God. 
PSA.86.11	Teach me Your way, 
PSA.86.12	I praise You, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and glorify Your Name forever. 
PSA.86.13	For great is Your lovingkindness toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest part of 
PSA.86.14	God, the proud have risen up against me and a gang of ruthless people have sought my life, and have not set You before them. 
PSA.86.15	But You, my Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, full of love and truth. 
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and be gracious to me. Give Your strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your maidservant. 
PSA.86.17	Make me a sign for good, so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed. For You, 
PSA.87.1	A psalm of the sons of Korah, a song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 
PSA.87.2	 loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of you, city of God. Selah 
PSA.87.4	“I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge Me— behold Philistia and Tyre, with Cush: ‘This one was born there.’” 
PSA.87.5	But of Zion it will be said: “This one and that one were born in her.” And Elyon Himself will establish her. 
PSA.87.6	 will count in the register of the peoples: “This one was born there.” Selah 
PSA.87.7	Then singing and dancing— all my fountains of joy are in you!
PSA.88.1	A song, a psalm of the sons of Korah, for the music director, for singing Mahalath, a contemplative song of Heman the Ezrahite. 
PSA.88.2	, God of my salvation, day and night I cried out before You. 
PSA.88.3	Let my prayer come before You. Turn Your ear to my cry. 
PSA.88.4	For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to 
PSA.88.5	I am counted with those who go down into the Pit. I have become as one with no strength— 
PSA.88.6	abandoned among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more— cut off from Your hand. 
PSA.88.7	You have laid me in the lowest places, in dark places, in the depths. 
PSA.88.8	Your wrath lies heavily on me. You afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah 
PSA.88.9	You have put my companions far from me. You have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and I cannot go out. 
PSA.88.10	My eye fails from affliction. I call upon You every day, 
PSA.88.11	Will You work wonders for the dead? Or will the departed spirits rise up praising You? Selah 
PSA.88.12	Will Your love be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in the place of ruin? 
PSA.88.13	Will Your wonders be known in the darkness? Your righteousness in the land of oblivion? 
PSA.88.14	But I—I cried out to You, 
PSA.88.15	, why do You spurn me? Why do You hide Your face from me? 
PSA.88.16	From my youth I have been afflicted and close to death. I suffer Your terrors—I am desperate! 
PSA.88.17	Your fury has swept over me. Your terrors have cut me off. 
PSA.88.18	Like water they surge around me all day. They close in on me together. 
PSA.88.19	Friend and loved one You took far from me. Darkness has become my companion.
PSA.89.1	A contemplative song of Ethan the Ezrahite. 
PSA.89.2	I will sing of the love of 
PSA.89.3	For I said, “Let your lovingkindness be built up forever! The heavens—let Your faithfulness be made firm there!” 
PSA.89.4	“I have made a covenant with My chosen one. I have sworn to David My servant: 
PSA.89.5	‘Forever I will establish your seed, and will build your throne from generation to generation.’” Selah 
PSA.89.6	The heavens praise Your wonders, 
PSA.89.7	For who in the skies can compare to 
PSA.89.8	God is greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all around Him. 
PSA.89.9	, who is like You, mighty 
PSA.89.10	You rule over the swelling of the sea. When its waves mount up, You still them. 
PSA.89.11	You crushed Rahab like a slain one. You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm. 
PSA.89.12	The heavens are Yours, also Yours the earth —the world and its fullness— You have founded them. 
PSA.89.13	You created the north and the south. Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at Your Name. 
PSA.89.14	Your arm is mighty, Your hand is strong, exalted is Your right hand. 
PSA.89.15	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne. Lovingkindness and truth go before You. 
PSA.89.16	Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout, They walk in the light of Your presence, 
PSA.89.17	They rejoice in Your Name all day, and by Your righteousness they are exalted. 
PSA.89.18	For You are the glory of their strength, and by Your favor our horn is exalted. 
PSA.89.19	For our shield belongs to 
PSA.89.20	Then You spoke in vision to Your godly ones, and said: “I have bestowed help on a warrior. I have exalted one chosen from among the people. 
PSA.89.21	I have found David My servant. With My holy oil I have anointed him. 
PSA.89.22	With him My hand will be established. Surely My arm will strengthen him. 
PSA.89.23	No enemy will exact tribute from him, no son of wickedness will oppress him. 
PSA.89.24	I will crush his adversaries before him, and strike down those who hate him. 
PSA.89.25	My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with him, and by My Name his horn will be exalted. 
PSA.89.26	I will also set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers. 
PSA.89.27	He will call to Me: ‘You are my Father, my God and the rock of my salvation.’ 
PSA.89.28	I also will set him as firstborn— the highest of the kings of earth. 
PSA.89.29	I will maintain My love for him forever, and My covenant with him will be firm. 
PSA.89.30	His seed I will establish forever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 
PSA.89.31	If his sons forsake My 
PSA.89.32	if they violate My decrees, and do not keep My 
PSA.89.33	then I will punish their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with flogging. 
PSA.89.34	But I will not withdraw My lovingkindness from him, nor will I betray My faithfulness. 
PSA.89.35	I will not violate My covenant, nor alter what My lips have uttered. 
PSA.89.36	Once for all I have sworn by My holiness —surely I will not lie to David— 
PSA.89.37	his descendants will endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me, 
PSA.89.38	and as the moon, established forever, and a trustworthy witness in the sky.” Selah 
PSA.89.39	But You have cast off and spurned, You have become furious with Your anointed one. 
PSA.89.40	You have renounced the covenant of Your servant. You have defiled his crown even to the ground. 
PSA.89.41	You have broken down all his walls. You reduced his strongholds to ruin. 
PSA.89.42	All who pass by have plundered him. He has become a taunt to his neighbors. 
PSA.89.43	You exalted the right hand of his foes and made all his enemies rejoice. 
PSA.89.44	You turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle. 
PSA.89.45	You brought his splendor to an end, and cast his throne down to the ground. 
PSA.89.46	You cut short the days of his youth. You covered him with shame. Selah 
PSA.89.47	How long, 
PSA.89.48	Remember how short my life span is! For what futility have You created all the children of men? 
PSA.89.49	What man can live and not see death? Can he deliver himself from the clutches of 
PSA.89.50	Where is Your former lovingkindness, my Lord, which You swore to David in Your faithfulness? 
PSA.89.51	Remember, my Lord, the mockery against Your servants that I bear in my heart from so many peoples. 
PSA.89.52	How Your enemies have mocked, 
PSA.89.53	Blessed be 
PSA.90.1	A prayer of Moses the man of God. My Lord, You have been our dwelling from generation to generation. 
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born, or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God! 
PSA.90.3	You turn mankind back to dust, saying, “Return, children of Adam!” 
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in Your sight are like a day just passing by, or like a watch in the night. 
PSA.90.5	You sweep them away in their sleep. In the morning they are like sprouting grass— 
PSA.90.6	in the morning it flourishes and springs up, by evening it withers and dries up. 
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by Your anger and terrified by Your wrath. 
PSA.90.8	You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence. 
PSA.90.9	For all our days have passed away under Your wrath. We spent our years like a sigh. 
PSA.90.10	The span of our years is seventy —or with strength, eighty— yet at best they are trouble and sorrow. For they are soon gone, and we fly away. 
PSA.90.11	Who knows the power of Your anger? Your fury leads to awe of you. 
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days, so that we may get a heart of wisdom. 
PSA.90.13	Relent, 
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us in the morning with Your love, so we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. 
PSA.90.15	Gladden us for as many days as You have humbled us, as many years as we have seen misery. 
PSA.90.16	Let Your work appear to Your servants, and Your splendor on their children. 
PSA.90.17	Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us. Establish the work of our hands for us— yes, establish the work of our hands. 
PSA.91.1	He who dwells in the shelter of Elyon, will abide in the shadow of Shaddai. 
PSA.91.2	I will say of 
PSA.91.3	For He will rescue you from the hunter’s trap and from the deadly pestilence. 
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you will find refuge. His faithfulness is body armor and shield. 
PSA.91.5	You will not fear the terror by night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 
PSA.91.6	nor the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the scourge that lays waste at noon. 
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 
PSA.91.8	You will only look on with your eyes and see the wicked paid back. 
PSA.91.9	For you have made Elyon your dwelling, even 
PSA.91.10	so no evil will befall you nor any plague come near your tent. 
PSA.91.11	For He will give His angels charge over you, to guard you in all your ways. 
PSA.91.12	Upon their hands they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. 
PSA.91.13	You will tread upon the lion and cobra, trample the young lion and serpent. 
PSA.91.14	“Because he has devoted his love to Me, I will deliver him. I will set him securely on high, because he knows My Name. 
PSA.91.15	When he calls on Me, I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble, rescue him, and honor him. 
PSA.91.16	With long life will I satisfy him and show him My salvation.”
PSA.92.1	A psalm, a song for the Shabbat. 
PSA.92.2	It is good to praise 
PSA.92.3	to declare Your love in the morning and Your faithfulness at night, 
PSA.92.4	with a ten-string harp, with resounding music on the lyre. 
PSA.92.5	For You made me glad, 
PSA.92.6	How great are Your works, 
PSA.92.7	A brutish man does not know, nor does a fool understand. 
PSA.92.8	Though the wicked spring up like grass, and all evildoers flourish, it is only to be ruined forever. 
PSA.92.9	But You, 
PSA.92.10	For behold, Your enemies, 
PSA.92.11	But You exalted my horn like that of a wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil. 
PSA.92.12	My eye can gaze on those lying in wait for me. My ears hear about evildoers rising up against me. 
PSA.92.13	The righteous will flourish like a palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
PSA.92.14	Planted in the House of 
PSA.92.15	They will still yield fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and freshness. 
PSA.92.16	They declare, “
PSA.93.1	 reigns—He is robed in majesty! 
PSA.93.2	Your throne is established from of old. You are from everlasting. 
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, 
PSA.93.4	More than the sounds of many waters— more majestic than the breakers of the sea— so majestic is 
PSA.93.5	Your testimonies are very sure. Holiness befits Your House, 
PSA.94.1	God of vengeance, 
PSA.94.2	Rise up, O Judge of the earth! Pay back to the proud what they deserve. 
PSA.94.3	How long will the wicked, 
PSA.94.4	They gush out, they speak arrogance— all the evildoers keep boasting. 
PSA.94.5	They crush Your people, 
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the outsider, and murder the fatherless. 
PSA.94.7	So they say: “
PSA.94.8	Pay attention, stupid among the people! Fools, when will you comprehend? 
PSA.94.9	He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see? 
PSA.94.10	He who chastens nations, will He not rebuke— One who teaches humanity knowledge? 
PSA.94.11	 knows human thoughts— they are but a breath. 
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the one You discipline, 
PSA.94.13	to give him rest from days of trouble —until a pit is dug for the wicked. 
PSA.94.14	For 
PSA.94.15	For rightness will be restored to justice, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against evildoers? 
PSA.94.17	Unless 
PSA.94.18	If I say: “My foot has slipped,” Your mercy, 
PSA.94.19	When my troubling thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations comfort my soul. 
PSA.94.20	Can a throne of corruption be aligned with You—planning distress by decree? 
PSA.94.21	They band together against the life of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood. 
PSA.94.22	But 
PSA.94.23	He will repay them for their wickedness, and will annihilate them in their evil. 
PSA.95.1	O come, let us sing for joy to 
PSA.95.2	Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving. Let us shout joyfully to Him with songs. 
PSA.95.3	For 
PSA.95.4	In His hand are the depths of the earth, the mountain peaks are His also. 
PSA.95.5	The sea is His—He made it, and His hands formed the dry land. 
PSA.95.6	Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before 
PSA.95.7	For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the flock of His hand. Today, if you hear His voice: 
PSA.95.8	“Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, 
PSA.95.9	when your fathers tested Me, they challenged Me, even though they had seen My work. 
PSA.95.10	For forty years I loathed that generation. So I said: ‘It is a people whose heart goes astray, who do not know My ways.’ 
PSA.95.11	Therefore I swore in My anger, ‘They shall never enter into My rest.’” 
PSA.96.1	Sing to 
PSA.96.2	Sing to 
PSA.96.3	Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous deeds among all peoples. 
PSA.96.4	For great is 
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but 
PSA.96.6	Splendor and majesty are before Him. Strength and beauty are in His Sanctuary. 
PSA.96.7	Ascribe to 
PSA.96.8	Ascribe to 
PSA.96.9	Bow down to 
PSA.96.10	Say among the nations: “
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens be glad, let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar—and all that fills it. 
PSA.96.12	Let the land exult—and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy— 
PSA.96.13	before 
PSA.97.1	 reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the many islands be glad. 
PSA.97.2	Clouds and darkness are all around Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. 
PSA.97.3	Fire goes before Him and burns up His adversaries on every side. 
PSA.97.4	His lightning lights up the world— the earth sees and trembles. 
PSA.97.5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of 
PSA.97.6	The heavens declare His righteousness, and all the peoples have seen His glory. 
PSA.97.7	Let all who serve graven images be ashamed—who boast in idols. Bow down before Him, all you gods! 
PSA.97.8	Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of Your judgments, 
PSA.97.9	For You, 
PSA.97.10	You who love

PSA.99.3	Let them praise Your great and awesome Name: holy is He. 
PSA.99.4	The might of a king loves justice. You have established fairness. You executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 
PSA.99.5	Exalt 
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron were among His 
PSA.99.7	He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud. They kept His testimonies, and the decree that He gave them. 
PSA.99.8	 our God, You answered them. A forgiving God You were to them, though You avenged their misdeeds. 
PSA.99.9	Exalt 
PSA.100.1	A psalm of thanksgiving. Shout joyfully to 
PSA.100.2	Serve 
PSA.100.3	Know that 
PSA.100.4	Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise! Praise Him, bless His Name. 
PSA.100.5	For 
PSA.101.1	A psalm of David. I will sing of lovingkindness and justice. To You, 
PSA.101.2	I will behave wisely in the way of integrity —when will You come to me? I walk in my house with integrity in my heart. 
PSA.101.3	No base thing will I set before my eyes. Twisted behavior I hate— it will not cling to me. 
PSA.101.4	A perverse heart will depart from me. I will know nothing evil. 
PSA.101.5	Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret —him I will silence. Who has haughty eyes and a proud heart —him I will not tolerate. 
PSA.101.6	My eyes are on the trustworthy of the land, to be in my company. One walking in a blameless way will serve me. 
PSA.101.7	No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house. No one who utters lies will endure before my eyes. 
PSA.101.8	Each morning I silence all the land’s wicked ones— to cut off from 
PSA.102.1	A prayer of the afflicted one, when he is faint and pours out his lament before 
PSA.102.2	, hear my prayer, let my cry come to You. 
PSA.102.3	Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn Your ear to me— in the day I call, answer me quickly. 
PSA.102.4	For my days vanished like smoke, and my bones were burned like coals. 
PSA.102.5	My heart is stricken and withered like grass, so that I even forget to eat my bread. 
PSA.102.6	Because of the sound of my groaning, my bones cling to my flesh. 
PSA.102.7	I am like a pelican of the desert, like an owl of the waste places. 
PSA.102.8	I lie awake, like a lonely bird on a roof. 
PSA.102.9	My enemies taunt me all day. My deriders use my name to curse. 
PSA.102.10	For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears— 
PSA.102.11	because of Your indignation and wrath, for You have picked me up and tossed me aside. 
PSA.102.12	My days are like a lengthening shadow, and I wither away like grass. 
PSA.102.13	But You, 
PSA.102.14	You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her, for the appointed time has come, 
PSA.102.15	for her stones are dear to Your servants, and they cherish her dust. 
PSA.102.16	So the nations will fear 
PSA.102.17	For 
PSA.102.18	He has turned to the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer. 
PSA.102.19	Let it be written for a generation to come, that a people to be created may praise 
PSA.102.20	For He looks down from His holy height, from heaven 
PSA.102.21	to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to set free those condemned to death, 
PSA.102.22	to declare the Name of 
PSA.102.23	when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship 
PSA.102.24	He brought down my strength in midcourse. He shortened my days. 
PSA.102.25	I say, “My God, do not take me up in the middle of my days. Your years endure through all generations! 
PSA.102.26	Long ago You founded the earth, the heavens are the work of Your hands. 
PSA.102.27	They will perish, but You will remain. All of them will wear out like a garment. Like clothing You change them, so they change. 
PSA.102.28	But You are the same, and Your years will never end. 
PSA.102.29	The children of Your servants will live. Their descendants will be established before You.”
PSA.103.1	Of David. Bless 
PSA.103.2	Bless 
PSA.103.3	He forgives all your iniquity. He heals all your diseases. 
PSA.103.4	He redeems your life from the Pit. He crowns you with lovingkindness and compassions. 
PSA.103.5	He satisfies your years with good things, so that your youth is renewed like an eagle. 
PSA.103.6	 executes justice— judgments for all who are oppressed. 
PSA.103.7	He made His ways known to Moses, His deeds to the children of Israel. 
PSA.103.8	 is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and plentiful in mercy. 
PSA.103.9	He will not always accuse, nor will He keep His anger forever. 
PSA.103.10	He has not treated us according to our sins, or repaid us according to our iniquities. 
PSA.103.11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His mercy for those who fear Him. 
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. 
PSA.103.13	As a father has compassion on his children, so 
PSA.103.14	For He knows our frame. He remembers that we are but dust. 
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are like grass— he flourishes like a flower of the field, 
PSA.103.16	but when the wind blows over it, it is gone, and its place is no longer known. 
PSA.103.17	But the mercy of 
PSA.103.18	to those who keep His covenant, who remember to observe His instructions. 
PSA.103.19	 has set up His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all. 
PSA.103.20	Bless 
PSA.103.21	Bless 
PSA.103.22	Bless 
PSA.104.1	Bless 
PSA.104.2	wrapping Yourself in light as a robe, stretching out heaven like a curtain, 
PSA.104.3	laying beams for His upper rooms in waters, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind, 
PSA.104.4	making His angels spirits, His servants a flaming fire. 
PSA.104.5	He set the earth upon its foundations, so it should not totter forever and ever. 
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep as with a garment—the waters standing above the mountains. 
PSA.104.7	At Your rebuke the waters fled. At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away. 
PSA.104.8	The waters go up the mountains, then down to the valleys— to the place that You assigned to them. 
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary to the waters that they may not cross over, so they may not return to cover the earth. 
PSA.104.10	You make springs gush into the valleys. They run between the mountains. 
PSA.104.11	They give drink to all the beasts of the field— the wild donkeys quench their thirst. 
PSA.104.12	Beside them the birds of the sky dwell— they sing among the branches. 
PSA.104.13	He waters mountains from His upper rooms. The earth is full of the fruit of Your labors. 
PSA.104.14	He causes grass to spring up for the cattle, and vegetation for man to cultivate, to bring forth bread out of the earth, 
PSA.104.15	wine that makes man’s heart glad, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains man’s heart. 
PSA.104.16	The trees of 
PSA.104.17	where birds make their nests, and the stork—her home is the fir trees. 
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for wild goats, the cliffs a refuge for rock badgers. 
PSA.104.19	He made the moon for appointed times, the sun knows its going down. 
PSA.104.20	You bring darkness, so it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl. 
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar for prey, seeking their food from God. 
PSA.104.22	But when the sun rises, they gather and lie down in their dens. 
PSA.104.23	Man goes out to his work, and to his labor until the evening. 
PSA.104.24	, how countless are Your works! In wisdom You made them all— the earth is full of Your creatures. 
PSA.104.25	There is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with gliding things innumerable, living creatures, both small and large. 
PSA.104.26	There, ships go to and fro. Leviathan—You formed to frolic there. 
PSA.104.27	They all look to You to give them their food at the right time. 
PSA.104.28	When You give it to them, they gather it up. When You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good. 
PSA.104.29	But when You hide Your face— they are dismayed. You take away their breath— they perish, and return to their dust. 
PSA.104.30	You send forth Your 
PSA.104.31	May the glory of 
PSA.104.32	He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. 
PSA.104.33	I will sing to 
PSA.104.34	Let my meditation be sweet to Him. I—I will rejoice in 
PSA.104.35	Let sinners vanish from the earth and let the wicked be no more. Bless 
PSA.105.1	Praise 
PSA.105.2	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him— tell about all His wonders! 
PSA.105.3	Glory in His holy Name. Let the heart of those who seek 
PSA.105.4	Seek 
PSA.105.5	Remember His wonders that He has done, His miracles and the judgments of His mouth, 
PSA.105.6	O seed of Abraham, His servant, O children of Jacob, His chosen ones. 
PSA.105.7	He is 
PSA.105.8	He remembers His covenant forever— the word He commanded for a thousand generations— 
PSA.105.9	which He made with Abraham, and swore to Isaac, 
PSA.105.10	and confirmed to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
PSA.105.11	saying, “To you I give the land of Canaan, the portion of your inheritance.” 
PSA.105.12	When they were but few in number, few indeed, and foreigners in it, 
PSA.105.13	wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people, 
PSA.105.14	He allowed no one to oppress them— for their sake He rebuked kings: 
PSA.105.15	“Touch not My anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.” 
PSA.105.16	He called down a famine on the land. He broke the whole supply of bread. 
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them— Joseph, sold as a slave. 
PSA.105.18	They hurt His feet with shackles, he was put in irons— 
PSA.105.19	till the time that his word came true— the word of 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and released him. The ruler of the peoples set him free. 
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house, ruler over all his possessions, 
PSA.105.22	to discipline his princes at his will, and teach his elders wisdom. 
PSA.105.23	Then Israel came into Egypt, Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
PSA.105.24	He made His people very fruitful, and made them more numerous than their foes. 
PSA.105.25	He turned their hearts to hate His people, to deal shrewdly with His servants. 
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen. 
PSA.105.27	They performed His signs among them —miracles in the land of Ham. 
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and it was dark, so they did not rebel against His words. 
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die. 
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs, even in their royal chambers. 
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and a swarm of gnats came within all their borders. 
PSA.105.32	He gave them a rain of hail, flames of fire throughout their land. 
PSA.105.33	He struck their vines and their fig trees and shattered the trees of their country. 
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the locust came —young locusts without number— 
PSA.105.35	to eat up every green thing in their land and eat up the fruit of their ground. 
PSA.105.36	Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor. 
PSA.105.37	Then He brought them out with silver and gold, and no one among His tribes faltered. 
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they left— for dread of them had fallen on them. 
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud as a covering and fire to give light at night. 
PSA.105.40	They asked, and He brought quail, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
PSA.105.41	He opened a rock, and waters gushed out, flowed as a river in dry places. 
PSA.105.42	For He remembered His holy word to Abraham His servant. 
PSA.105.43	So He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing. 
PSA.105.44	He gave them the lands of the nations, so they inherited the labor of the peoples 
PSA.105.45	so that they might keep His statutes and observe His laws. Halleluyah!
PSA.106.1	Halleluyah! Praise 
PSA.106.2	Who can speak of 
PSA.106.3	Blessed are those who maintain justice, who do what is right at all times. 
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.5	so I may behold the prosperity of Your chosen ones, exult in the joy of Your nation, and give praise with Your inheritance. 
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly. 
PSA.106.7	Our fathers in Egypt did not ponder Your wonders. Nor did they remember Your abundant lovingkindness, but rebelled by the sea— at the Sea of Reeds. 
PSA.106.8	Yet He saved them for His Name’s sake, to make His mighty power known. 
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Sea of Reeds and it dried up, and He led them through the depths as through a wilderness. 
PSA.106.10	So He saved them from the hand of those who hated them, redeemed them from the enemy’s hand. 
PSA.106.11	The waters covered their adversaries— not one of them was left. 
PSA.106.12	Then they believed His words. They were singing His praise. 
PSA.106.13	How quickly they forgot His works, and would not wait for His counsel! 
PSA.106.14	In the wilderness they craved ravenously, in the desert they tested God. 
PSA.106.15	So He gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them. 
PSA.106.16	Then they envied Moses in the camp, and also Aaron, the holy one of 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened up, swallowed Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
PSA.106.18	Also a fire blazed in their company, a flame consumed the wicked. 
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb and worshipped a molten image. 
PSA.106.20	Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a grass-eating ox. 
PSA.106.21	They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt— 
PSA.106.22	miracles in the land of Ham, awesome things by the Sea of Reeds. 
PSA.106.23	So He commanded their extermination, had not Moses, His chosen one, stood in the breach before Him, to turn His wrath from destroying them. 
PSA.106.24	Then they scorned the pleasing land— they did not trust in His word. 
PSA.106.25	Instead, they grumbled in their tents. They would not listen to 
PSA.106.26	Therefore He swore to them that He would make them fall in the desert, 
PSA.106.27	and disperse their offspring among the nations, and scatter them through the lands. 
PSA.106.28	Then they yoked themselves to Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of dead things. 
PSA.106.29	So they provoked Him with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them. 
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas stood up and intervened, so the plague was stopped. 
PSA.106.31	It was credited to him as righteousness, from generation to generation forever. 
PSA.106.32	By the waters of Meribah they angered Him, and trouble came on Moses because of them. 
PSA.106.33	For they embittered his spirit and he spoke rashly with his lips. 
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples, as 
PSA.106.35	Instead they mingled with the nations and learned their practices. 
PSA.106.36	They worshipped their idols, which became a snare to them. 
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. 
PSA.106.38	They shed innocent blood—the blood of their sons and their daughters, sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. So the land was desecrated with blood. 
PSA.106.39	So they defiled themselves by their deeds, and prostituted themselves by their practices. 
PSA.106.40	Therefore the anger of 
PSA.106.41	He handed them to the nations— those who hated them ruled over them. 
PSA.106.42	Their enemies oppressed them, so they were subdued under their hand. 
PSA.106.43	Many times He delivered them, but they kept rebelling deliberately, and so sank low into their iniquity. 
PSA.106.44	Yet He saw their distress, when He heard their cry, 
PSA.106.45	remembered His covenant to them, and relented in the greatness of His mercy. 
PSA.106.46	He caused them to be pitied in the presence of all their captors. 
PSA.106.47	Save us, 
PSA.106.48	Blessed be 
PSA.107.1	Praise 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of 
PSA.107.3	whom He gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea. 
PSA.107.4	Some wandered in a desert, a wasteland. They found no way to an inhabited city. 
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty, their souls ebbed away. 
PSA.107.6	So they cried out to 
PSA.107.7	Then He led them by a straight way to go to a city where they could live. 
PSA.107.8	Let them praise 
PSA.107.9	for He satisfies the thirsty soul and fills the hungry soul with goodness. 
PSA.107.10	Some sat in darkness and deep gloom, prisoners in misery and iron chains, 
PSA.107.11	for they had defied God’s words, and spurned the counsel of Elyon. 
PSA.107.12	So He humbled their heart with trouble. They stumbled, and no one was helping. 
PSA.107.13	So they cried out to 
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and deep gloom, breaking their chains. 
PSA.107.15	Let them praise 
PSA.107.16	for He shattered bronze gates, and broke into pieces iron bars. 
PSA.107.17	Some became fools because of their rebellious ways, and were afflicted due to their iniquities. 
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorred all food, and they drew near the gates of death. 
PSA.107.19	So they cried out to 
PSA.107.20	He sent His word and healed them, and rescued them from their pits. 
PSA.107.21	Let them praise 
PSA.107.22	Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of His works with joyful singing. 
PSA.107.23	Some go out to the sea in ships, doing business on the mighty waters. 
PSA.107.24	They saw the works of 
PSA.107.25	For He spoke and raised a stormy wind, lifting up towering waves. 
PSA.107.26	They mounted up to the sky and plunged down to the depths. In their peril their souls melted away. 
PSA.107.27	They reeled and staggered like a drunk, and all their skill was bewildered. 
PSA.107.28	So they cried out to 
PSA.107.29	He stilled the storm to a whisper— the waves were hushed. 
PSA.107.30	They were glad when it became calm, and He led them to their desired haven. 
PSA.107.31	Let them praise 
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him at the assembly of elders. 
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into a wilderness and springs of water into thirsty ground, 
PSA.107.34	and a fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants. 
PSA.107.35	He turns a desert into a pool of water, a dry land into springs of water. 
PSA.107.36	There He brings the hungry to live, and they establish a city for a dwelling. 
PSA.107.37	So they sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest. 
PSA.107.38	He blesses them, they multiply greatly, and He does not let their herds diminish, 
PSA.107.39	after they were few and crushed by oppression, calamity and sorrow. 
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt on princes, making them wander in trackless waste. 
PSA.107.41	But He lifts the needy high above affliction, and makes their families like a flock. 
PSA.107.42	The upright see it and are glad, and all iniquity shuts its mouth. 
PSA.107.43	Who is wise? Let him observe these things, and consider 
PSA.108.1	A song, a psalm of David. 
PSA.108.2	My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing, sing praises with all my soul. 
PSA.108.3	Awake, harp and lyre— I will awaken the dawn! 
PSA.108.4	I will give thanks to You, 
PSA.108.5	For Your love is higher than the heavens, Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 
PSA.108.6	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, let Your glory be above all the earth. 
PSA.108.7	Let Your beloved ones be delivered. Save with Your right hand, answer me! 
PSA.108.8	God has spoken in His Sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succot. 
PSA.108.9	Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine. Also Ephraim is a helmet for My head, Judah is my scepter. 
PSA.108.10	Moab is My washbowl. I throw my shoe on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia.” 
PSA.108.11	Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
PSA.108.12	O God, have You not spurned us? Will You go out no more with our armies? 
PSA.108.13	Give us help against the adversary— for useless is deliverance through man. 
PSA.108.14	With God we will do valiantly— and He will trample our foes. 
PSA.109.1	For the music director, a psalm of David. O God of my praise, be not silent. 
PSA.109.2	For the wicked and the deceitful have opened their mouth against me. They spoke to me with a lying tongue, 
PSA.109.3	with hateful words surrounded me, and fought against me without cause. 
PSA.109.4	In return for my love they are my accusers, but I am in prayer. 
PSA.109.5	They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 
PSA.109.6	Set a wicked man over him, let an accuser stand at his right hand. 
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and may his prayer be as sin. 
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few, let another take his position. 
PSA.109.9	May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 
PSA.109.10	Let his children wander and beg and may they search in their ruins. 
PSA.109.11	Let a creditor seize all he has, and may strangers plunder his labor. 
PSA.109.12	Let no one show him mercy, or take pity on his fatherless children. 
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off, and his name be blotted out in the next generation. 
PSA.109.14	May the guilt of his fathers be remembered before 
PSA.109.15	Let their sins be before 
PSA.109.16	For he never remembered to show mercy. But he persecuted a poor and needy man, crushed in spirit, to put him to death. 
PSA.109.17	How he loved cursing—may it fall on him! He had no pleasure in blessing— may it be far from him! 
PSA.109.18	He wore cursing like his robe, until it filled his belly like water, and his bones like oil. 
PSA.109.19	May it be like a cloak wrapped around him, like a belt tied around him always. 
PSA.109.20	Let this be 
PSA.109.21	But You, 
PSA.109.22	For I am afflicted and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 
PSA.109.23	I fade away like an evening shadow, shaken off like a locust. 
PSA.109.24	My knees totter from fasting, and my flesh is lean, with no fat. 
PSA.109.25	And I have become a taunt to them. When they see me, they wag their head. 
PSA.109.26	Help me, 
PSA.109.27	Let them know that it is Your hand— that You, 
PSA.109.28	They may curse, but You bless. When they arise, they will be ashamed, but Your servant will rejoice. 
PSA.109.29	My accusers will be clothed in disgrace, and wrapped in shame as in a cloak. 
PSA.109.30	I will greatly thank 
PSA.109.31	For He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who condemn his soul. 
PSA.110.1	A psalm of David. 
PSA.110.2	 will extend your mighty rod from Zion: “Rule in the midst of your enemies.” 
PSA.110.3	Your people will be a freewill offering in a day of your power. In holy splendors, from dawn’s womb, yours is the dew of your youth. 
PSA.110.4	 has sworn, and will not change His mind: “You are a 
PSA.110.5	My Lord is at your right hand. He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath. 
PSA.110.6	He will judge among the nations, heaping up corpses. He will crush heads over the entire land. 
PSA.110.7	He will drink from a stream along the way —so His head will be exalted.
PSA.111.1	Halleluyah! I praise 
PSA.111.2	Great are the works of 
PSA.111.3	Glorious and majestic is His work, and His righteousness endures forever. 
PSA.111.4	He made His wonders memorable. 
PSA.111.5	He gives food to those who fear Him. He remembers His covenant forever. 
PSA.111.6	He shows His people His powerful deeds, giving them the heritage of the nations. 
PSA.111.7	The works of His hands are truth and justice. All His precepts are trustworthy— 
PSA.111.8	they are upheld forever and ever, made in truth and uprightness. 
PSA.111.9	He has sent redemption to His people. He has ordained His covenant forever. Holy and awesome is His Name. 
PSA.111.10	The fear of 
PSA.112.1	Halleluyah! Happy is the man who fears 
PSA.112.2	His offspring will be mighty in the land. The generation of the upright will be blessed. 
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. 
PSA.112.4	Light shines in the darkness for the upright. Gracious, compassionate and just is he. 
PSA.112.5	Good comes to a man who is gracious and lends. He will order his affairs with fairness. 
PSA.112.6	Surely he will never be shaken. The righteous are remembered forever. 
PSA.112.7	He is not afraid of bad news— his heart is steadfast, trusting in 
PSA.112.8	His heart is secure, he will not fear— until he gazes on his foes. 
PSA.112.9	He gives freely to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn is lifted high in honor. 
PSA.112.10	The wicked will see it and be indignant. He will gnash with his teeth and waste away. The desire of the wicked will perish. 
PSA.113.1	Halleluyah! Praise, O servants of 
PSA.113.2	Blessed be the Name of 
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun to its going down the Name of 
PSA.113.4	 is high above all nations, His glory is above the heavens. 
PSA.113.5	Who is like 
PSA.113.6	who brings Himself down to look upon heaven and upon earth? 
PSA.113.7	He raises the poor from the dust, lifts up the needy out of the dunghill, 
PSA.113.8	to seat him with princes, with the princes of His people. 
PSA.113.9	He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother of children. Halleluyah!
PSA.114.1	When Israel came out of Egypt, Jacob’s house from a people foreign-speaking, 
PSA.114.2	Judah became His Sanctuary, Israel His dominion. 
PSA.114.3	The sea saw and fled, the Jordan turned back. 
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 
PSA.114.5	Why was it, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back? 
PSA.114.6	O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O hills, like lambs? 
PSA.114.7	Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 
PSA.114.8	who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
PSA.115.1	Not to us, 
PSA.115.2	Why should the nations say: “Where is their God now?” 
PSA.115.3	Our God is in the heavens— He does whatever pleases Him! 
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. 
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but cannot speak; eyes, but cannot see. 
PSA.115.6	They have ears, but cannot hear; noses, but cannot smell. 
PSA.115.7	They have hands, but cannot feel; feet, but cannot walk, nor utter a sound with their throat. 
PSA.115.8	Those making them will become like them —everyone trusting in them. 
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust in 
PSA.115.10	O house of Aaron, trust in 
PSA.115.11	O you who fear 
PSA.115.12	 has been mindful of us, He will bless: He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron; 
PSA.115.13	He will bless those who fear 
PSA.115.14	May 
PSA.115.15	May you be blessed by 
PSA.115.16	The heavens are the heavens of 
PSA.115.17	The dead do not praise 
PSA.115.18	But we—we will bless

PSA.120.4	sharp arrows of the mighty, with burning coals of a broom tree! 
PSA.120.5	Woe to me, for I sojourn in Meshech, for I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 
PSA.120.6	My soul has too long dwelt with those who hate 
PSA.120.7	I am for

PSA.121.8	 will watch over your coming and your going from this time forth and forevermore.
PSA.122.1	A Song of Ascents. Of David. I rejoiced when they said to me, “Let us go to the House of 
PSA.122.2	Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem— 
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, built as a city joined together. 
PSA.122.4	There the tribes go up, the tribes of 
PSA.122.5	For there thrones for judgment are set up, the thrones of the house of David. 
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem— “May those who love you be at peace! 
PSA.122.7	May there be 
PSA.122.8	For the sake of my brothers and friends, I now say: “

PSA.124.4	Then the waters would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over our soul, 
PSA.124.5	then the raging waters would have swept over our soul.” 
PSA.124.6	Blessed be 
PSA.124.7	Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the snare of the trappers— the snare is broken, and we escaped! 
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the Name of

PSA.125.4	Do good, 
PSA.125.5	But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, 
PSA.126.1	A Song of Ascents. When 
PSA.126.2	Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with a song of joy. Then they said among the nations, “

PSA.127.1	A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon. Unless 
PSA.127.2	In vain you rise up early and stay up late, eating the bread of toil— for He provides for His beloved ones even in their sleep. 
PSA.127.3	Behold, children are a heritage of 
PSA.127.4	As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth. 
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies at the gate. 
PSA.128.1	A Song of Ascents. Happy is everyone in awe of

PSA.128.6	and may you live to see your children’s children. 
PSA.129.1	A Song of Ascents. “How many times they have been hostile to me, even from my youth” —let Israel now say— 
PSA.129.2	“How greatly they have been hostile to me, even from my youth. Yet they have not prevailed against me.

PSA.129.5	May all who hate Zion be driven back in disgrace.

PSA.129.8	So the passersby may never say: “The blessing of

PSA.130.6	My soul waits for my Lord, more than watchmen for the morning, watchmen for the morning. 
PSA.130.7	O Israel, wait for 
PSA.130.8	and He will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
PSA.131.1	A Song of Ascents. Of David.

PSA.132.12	if your children keep My covenant and My law that I will teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne forever.” 
PSA.132.13	For 
PSA.132.14	“This is My resting place forever. Here I dwell, for I have desired it. 
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless her food. I will satisfy her needy ones with bread. 
PSA.132.16	I will clothe her

PSA.132.18	His enemies I will clothe with shame, but upon himself his crown will shine.”
PSA.133.1	A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! 
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious oil upon the head, coming down upon the beard —Aaron’s beard— coming down on the collar of his robes. 
PSA.133.3	It is like the dew of Hermon, coming down upon the mountains of Zion. For there

PSA.135.8	He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both man and beast. 
PSA.135.9	He sent signs and wonders among you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh and all his servants. 
PSA.135.10	He struck down many nations and slew mighty kings: 
PSA.135.11	Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan, 
PSA.135.12	and gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to His people Israel.

PSA.137.2	On the willows there we hung up our harps.

PSA.138.3	On the day I called, You answered me. You made me bold with strength in my soul. 
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth will praise You, 
PSA.138.5	So they will sing of the ways of

PSA.139.1	For the music director: a psalm of David. 
PSA.139.2	Whenever I sit down or stand up, You know it. You discern my thinking from afar. 
PSA.139.3	You observe my journeying and my resting and You are familiar with all my ways. 
PSA.139.4	Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, 
PSA.139.5	You hemmed me in behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me. 
PSA.139.6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. 
PSA.139.7	Where can I go from Your 
PSA.139.8	If I go up to heaven, You are there, and if I make my bed in 
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the dawn and settle on the other side of the sea, 
PSA.139.10	even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will lay hold of me. 
PSA.139.11	If I say: “Surely darkness covers me, night keeps light at a distance from me,” 
PSA.139.12	even darkness is not dark for You, and night is as bright as day— darkness and light are alike. 
PSA.139.13	For You have created my conscience. You knit me together in my mother’s womb. 
PSA.139.14	I praise You, for I am awesomely, wonderfully made! Wonderful are Your works— and my soul knows that very well. 
PSA.139.15	My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. 
PSA.139.16	Your eyes saw me when I was unformed, and in Your book were written the days that were formed— when not one of them had come to be. 
PSA.139.17	How precious are Your thoughts, O God! How great is the sum of them! 
PSA.139.18	Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand! When I awake, I am still with You. 
PSA.139.19	If only You would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloody men! 
PSA.139.20	For they speak about You with wicked intent. Your enemies reproach You in vain. 
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate those who hate You, 
PSA.139.22	I hate them with total hatred— I consider them my enemies. 
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart. Examine me, and know my anxious thoughts, 
PSA.139.24	and see if there be any offensive way within me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
PSA.140.1	For the music director: a psalm of David. 
PSA.140.2	Rescue me, 
PSA.140.3	who devise evil in their heart— every day they stir up wars. 
PSA.140.4	They sharpen their tongue like a serpent’s —viper’s venom is under their lips. Selah 
PSA.140.5	Keep me safe, 
PSA.140.6	The proud have hidden a trap and cords for me. They spread out a net by the path. They set snares for me. Selah 
PSA.140.7	I said to 
PSA.140.8	God my Lord, the strength of my deliverance, You shield my head in the day of battle. 
PSA.140.9	Grant not, 
PSA.140.10	As for the head of those surrounding me, may the mischief of their lips overwhelm them. 
PSA.140.11	Let burning coals fall upon them. May they be cast into the fire, into deep pits, never to rise again. 
PSA.140.12	May a slanderer not endure in the land. May calamity hunt down a violent man. 
PSA.140.13	I know 
PSA.140.14	Surely, the righteous ones will praise Your name. The upright will dwell in Your presence.
PSA.141.1	A psalm of David. 
PSA.141.2	May my prayer be set before You like incense. May the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. 
PSA.141.3	Set a guard, 
PSA.141.4	Let not my heart turn to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity, nor let me eat of their delicacies. 
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous strike me— it is kindness. Let him correct me— it is oil on my head —my head will not refuse it. Yet still my prayer is against their wickedness. 
PSA.141.6	Their judges are thrown down from a cliff. Then they will hear my words, since they are sweet. 
PSA.141.7	As when one plows and breaks open the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of 
PSA.141.8	For my eyes are toward You, God my Lord. In You I have taken refuge— do not expose my soul. 
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the jaws of the trap they have laid for me, and from the snares of the evildoers. 
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely. 
PSA.142.1	A contemplative poem of David, when he was in the cave, a prayer. 
PSA.142.2	I cry aloud with my voice to 
PSA.142.3	I pour out my complaint before Him, before Him I tell my trouble. 
PSA.142.4	When my spirit grows faint within me, You know my path. In the way where I walk they have hidden a trap for me. 
PSA.142.5	Look at my right hand and see, for no one cares about me. I have no refuge— no one cares for my soul. 
PSA.142.6	I have cried out to You, 
PSA.142.7	Listen to my cry, for I am brought very low. Rescue me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 
PSA.142.8	Bring my soul out of prison, so I may praise Your Name. The righteous will triumph through me, for You will reward me. 
PSA.143.1	A psalm of David. Hear my prayer, 
PSA.143.2	Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for in Your eyes no one living is righteous. 
PSA.143.3	For an enemy pursues my soul. He crushes my life down to the ground. He makes me dwell in darkness, like those long dead. 
PSA.143.4	So my spirit grows faint within me. My heart is shocked within me. 
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old. I meditate on all You have done. I ponder the work of Your hands. 
PSA.143.6	I spread forth my hands to You. My soul longs for You as a parched land. Selah 
PSA.143.7	Answer me speedily, 
PSA.143.8	Make me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, for in You I trust. Show me the way I should go, for to You I lift up my soul. 
PSA.143.9	Deliver me from my enemies, 
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. Let Your good 
PSA.143.11	For Your Name’s sake, 
PSA.143.12	In Your mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all who harass my soul, for I am Your servant.
PSA.144.1	Of David. Blessed be 
PSA.144.2	He is my lovingkindness, my fortress, my strong tower, and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me. 
PSA.144.3	, what is man, that You take note of him? Or the son of man, that You consider him? 
PSA.144.4	Man is like a breath— his days are like a passing shadow. 
PSA.144.5	, part Your heavens and come down. Touch the mountains, so they smoke. 
PSA.144.6	Flash forth lightning and scatter them. Send out Your arrows and confuse them. 
PSA.144.7	Stretch forth Your hands from on high. Snatch me, deliver me out of deep waters, out of the hand of foreigners, 
PSA.144.8	whose mouth speaks falsehood, whose right hand is a right hand of deceit. 
PSA.144.9	God, I sing a new song to You, on a ten-string harp I sing praises to You— 
PSA.144.10	who gives salvation to kings, who rescues Your servant David from the evil sword. 
PSA.144.11	Snatch me, deliver me out of the hand of foreigners, whose mouth speaks falsehood, whose right hand is a right hand of deceit. 
PSA.144.12	Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters like corner pillars carved for the construction of a palace. 
PSA.144.13	Our storehouses are full, supplying every kind of produce. Our flocks increase by thousands and ten thousands in our fields. 
PSA.144.14	Our oxen bear a heavy load. There is no breach, no going into captivity, no outcry in our streets. 
PSA.144.15	Happy are such a people! Blessed are the people whose God is 
PSA.145.1	A psalm of praise. Of David. I will exalt You, my God, the King, and I will bless Your Name forever and ever.

PSA.146.2	I will praise

PSA.146.4	His breath departs, he returns to his dust. In that very day his plans perish. 
PSA.146.5	Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in 
PSA.146.6	who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps truth forever, 
PSA.146.7	who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives bread to the hungry.

PSA.147.9	He gives food to the cattle and to the young ravens which cry. 
PSA.147.10	He delights not in the horse’s strength, nor takes pleasure in a man’s legs.

PSA.147.16	He gives snow like wool. He scatters frost like ashes. 
PSA.147.17	He hurls down His hail like pebbles— who can stand before His cold? 
PSA.147.18	He sends forth His word and melts them. He makes His wind blow and waters flow. 
PSA.147.19	He declares His word to Jacob, His decrees and His rulings to Israel. 
PSA.147.20	He has not done so with any other nation. They have not known His judgments. Halleluyah!

PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 
PRO.1.2	to acquire wisdom and discipline, to understand the words of insight, 
PRO.1.3	to receive instruction in wise behavior, righteousness, justice and fairness, 
PRO.1.4	to give discernment to the naïve, knowledge and discretion to the youth 
PRO.1.5	(let the wise listen and increase learning and the discerning obtain wise counsel) 
PRO.1.6	to understand a proverb and a puzzle, the sayings of the wise and their riddles.
PRO.1.7	The fear of 
PRO.1.8	Hear, my son, your father’s instruction and forsake not your mother’s teaching. 
PRO.1.9	For they are a garland of grace for your head and a chain to adorn your neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in. 
PRO.1.11	Suppose they say: “Come with us! Let’s lie in wait for blood! Let’s ambush the innocent— for no reason! 
PRO.1.12	Let’s swallow them alive like 
PRO.1.13	We’ll find all sorts of valuable things, we’ll fill our homes with loot! 
PRO.1.14	Throw your lot in with us— we’ll all have one wallet.” 
PRO.1.15	My son, do not go along with them, keep your foot from their path— 
PRO.1.16	for their feet run to evil and they are swift to shed blood. 
PRO.1.17	Surely it is useless to spread a net in the eyes of all winged creatures! 
PRO.1.18	But they lie in wait for their own blood. They ambush their own lives. 
PRO.1.19	Such is the fate of all gaining by violence. It takes the life of its possessor.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in public squares. 
PRO.1.21	She cries out above the commotion. At the entrances of the city gates, she utters her speech: 
PRO.1.22	“How long will you naïve ones love simplicity, you scoffers delight in scoffing, and you fools hate knowledge? 
PRO.1.23	You are repulsed at my rebuke. Behold, I pour out my heart to you. I will make my words known to you. 
PRO.1.24	Because you refused when I called, and did not pay attention when I stretched out my hand, 
PRO.1.25	since you ignore all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, 
PRO.1.26	I in turn will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when dread comes on you, 
PRO.1.27	when your terror comes like a storm and your calamity sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when trouble and distress overwhelm you! 
PRO.1.28	Then they will cry out to me, but I will not answer! They will earnestly seek me, but will not find me. 
PRO.1.29	Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of 
PRO.1.30	they would not accept my counsel, they spurned all my reproof, 
PRO.1.31	so they will eat the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own schemes. 
PRO.1.32	For the backsliding of the naïve will kill them and the complacency of fools will destroy them. 
PRO.1.33	But whoever pays attention to me will live securely, and be free from the fear of evil.”
PRO.2.1	My son, if you accept my words and treasure my 
PRO.2.2	making your ear attentive to wisdom, inclining your heart to discernment, 
PRO.2.3	yes, if you call out for insight, lifting up your voice for discernment, 
PRO.2.4	if you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures, 
PRO.2.5	then you will know the fear of

PRO.2.7	He stores up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity. 
PRO.2.8	He guards the paths of justice, and protects the way of His 
PRO.2.9	Then you will discern what is right and just and fair—every good path. 
PRO.2.10	For wisdom will enter your heart and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 
PRO.2.11	Discretion will watch over you —discernment will guard you— 
PRO.2.12	to deliver you from the way of evil, from those speaking perverse things, 
PRO.2.13	who leave the straight paths to walk in ways of darkness, 
PRO.2.14	who rejoice in doing wrong and delight in the perversity of evil, 
PRO.2.15	whose paths are crooked and are devious in their ways— 
PRO.2.16	to deliver you from a seducing woman— a wayward wife with seductive words, 
PRO.2.17	who forsakes the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God. 
PRO.2.18	For her house sinks down to death and her tracks to the dead. 
PRO.2.19	None who go to her return nor reach the paths of life. 
PRO.2.20	So you will walk in the way of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous. 
PRO.2.21	For the upright will dwell in the land and the blameless will remain in it. 
PRO.2.22	But the wicked will be cut off from the land and the treacherous uprooted from it.
PRO.3.1	My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my 
PRO.3.2	For length of days and years of life, and 
PRO.3.3	Let kindness and truth never leave you— bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. 
PRO.3.4	Then you will gain favor and a good name in the eyes of God and man. 
PRO.3.5	Trust in 
PRO.3.6	In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. 
PRO.3.7	Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear 
PRO.3.8	It will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones. 
PRO.3.9	Honor 
PRO.3.10	Then your barns will be filled with plenty, your vats will overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, never despise 
PRO.3.12	For 
PRO.3.13	Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding. 
PRO.3.14	For her trade-value is better than silver, and her yield better than fine gold. 
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than jewels and nothing you desire compares to her. 
PRO.3.16	Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor. 
PRO.3.17	Her ways are pleasant ways, and all of her paths are 
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and blessed will be all who hold firmly to her. 
PRO.3.19	By wisdom 
PRO.3.20	By His knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds drip dew. 
PRO.3.21	My son, hold on to sound wisdom and discernment, do not let them out of your sight. 
PRO.3.22	They will be life to your soul, and an ornament to grace your neck. 
PRO.3.23	Then you will walk on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble. 
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 
PRO.3.25	Have no fear of sudden terror, or of the devastation of the wicked when it comes. 
PRO.3.26	For 
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act. 
PRO.3.28	Do not say to your neighbor, “Come back later— I’ll give it tomorrow,” when you have it with you. 
PRO.3.29	Do not plot evil against your neighbor while he lives trustfully beside you. 
PRO.3.30	Do not quarrel with a man for no reason —if he has done you no harm. 
PRO.3.31	Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways. 
PRO.3.32	For the devious are detestable to 
PRO.3.33	’s curse is on a wicked house, but He blesses a righteous home. 
PRO.3.34	Though He scoffs at the scoffers, He gives grace to the humble. 
PRO.3.35	The wise inherit honor, but fools are held up in disgrace.
PRO.4.1	Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention, to gain understanding. 
PRO.4.2	For I give you sound learning— do not forsake my instruction. 
PRO.4.3	When I was a son to my father, tender and special to my mother, 
PRO.4.4	he taught me and said to me: “Lay hold of my words in your heart, keep my commands and you will live! 
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. 
PRO.4.6	Do not forsake her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will watch over you. 
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is supreme—acquire wisdom! With all your acquisitions, get understanding. 
PRO.4.8	Prize her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you when you embrace her. 
PRO.4.9	She will set a garland of grace on your head. She will give you a crown of glory.”
PRO.4.10	Listen, my son, and accept my words, so the years of your life will be many. 
PRO.4.11	I instructed you in the way of wisdom. I have guided you along straight paths. 
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your step will not be hindered, and when you run, you will not stumble. 
PRO.4.13	Hold on tightly to instruction, do not let it go— guard it, for it is your life. 
PRO.4.14	Do not enter the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil people. 
PRO.4.15	Avoid it—do not travel on it— turn away from it and pass by. 
PRO.4.16	For they cannot sleep until they do evil. They are robbed of sleep until they make someone fall. 
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 
PRO.4.18	The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until the full day. 
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is like darkness. They do not know what makes them stumble. 
PRO.4.20	My son, pay attention to my words— incline your ear to my sayings. 
PRO.4.21	Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart. 
PRO.4.22	For they are life to those who find them and health to their whole body. 
PRO.4.23	Guard your heart diligently, for from it flow the springs of life. 
PRO.4.24	Put away perversity from your mouth, and keep devious lips far from you. 
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look directly ahead, and fix your gaze straight in front of you. 
PRO.4.26	 Clear a level path for your feet, so all your ways will be firm. 
PRO.4.27	Do not turn to the right or to the left. Divert your foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Incline your ear to my insight, 
PRO.5.2	that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge. 
PRO.5.3	For a seducing woman’s lips drip honey and her mouth is smoother than oil. 
PRO.5.4	But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword. 
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death, her steps lead straight to 
PRO.5.6	She does not keep straight to the path of life, her paths are crooked —but she does not know it. 
PRO.5.7	So now, my sons, listen to me and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth. 
PRO.5.8	Keep your path far from her and do not go near the door of her house— 
PRO.5.9	lest you give your strength to others and your years to one who is cruel; 
PRO.5.10	lest strangers feast on your strength, your labors go to a foreigner’s house. 
PRO.5.11	At the end of your life, you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent— 
PRO.5.12	and you will say, “How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned reproof! 
PRO.5.13	I would not listen to my teacher’s voice or incline my ear to my instructors. 
PRO.5.14	I was almost in utter ruin amid the community and congregation.” 
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern and running water from your own well. 
PRO.5.16	Should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in public squares? 
PRO.5.17	Let them be yours alone and not shared with strangers. 
PRO.5.18	May your fountain be blessed and may you delight in the wife of your youth. 
PRO.5.19	A lovely hind, a graceful doe— may her breasts satisfy you always, may you always be captivated by her love. 
PRO.5.20	Why, my son, be captivated by a seducing woman? Why embrace a foreigner’s bosom? 
PRO.5.21	For a man’s ways are before the eyes of 
PRO.5.22	The iniquities of a wicked man will ensnare him. The cords of his sin will hold him down. 
PRO.5.23	He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly. 
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have become a cosigner for your neighbor, if you have shaken hands in pledge with a stranger, 
PRO.6.2	if you are trapped by your own words, ensnared by the words of your mouth, 
PRO.6.3	then do this, my son, and free yourself, since you fell into your neighbor’s hand: Go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbor! 
PRO.6.4	Allow no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids. 
PRO.6.5	Escape like a gazelle from the hunter’s hand, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, you slacker— consider its ways and be wise! 
PRO.6.7	It has no commander, no overseer or ruler. 
PRO.6.8	Yet it prepares its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest. 
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie there, slacker? When will you get up from your sleep? 
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep— 
PRO.6.11	and your poverty comes like a bandit and your need like an armed man. 
PRO.6.12	A scoundrel, a wicked man, is one who goes around with a perverse mouth, 
PRO.6.13	winking his eyes, shuffling his feet, pointing his fingers, 
PRO.6.14	who continually plots evil with deceit in his heart stirring up strife. 
PRO.6.15	Therefore his disaster will come suddenly —in an instant he will be broken, with no remedy. 
PRO.6.16	Six things 
PRO.6.17	haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, 
PRO.6.18	a heart that plots wicked schemes, feet that run to evil, 
PRO.6.19	a false witness who spouts lies, and one who stirs up strife among brothers.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep your father’s 
PRO.6.21	Bind them on your heart continually— tie them around your neck. 
PRO.6.22	When you walk, they will guide you. When you lie down, they will watch over you, and when you wake up, they will speak to you. 
PRO.6.23	For the 
PRO.6.24	keeping you from the immoral woman, from a wayward wife’s smooth tongue. 
PRO.6.25	Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyelids. 
PRO.6.26	For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a loaf of bread; a man’s wife preys on your precious life. 
PRO.6.27	Can a man scoop fire into his lap without burning his clothes? 
PRO.6.28	Or can a man walk upon hot coals without scorching his feet? 
PRO.6.29	So is he who goes to another man’s wife. No one who touches her will go unpunished. 
PRO.6.30	Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving. 
PRO.6.31	Yet if he is caught, he must repay sevenfold, giving up all the wealth of his house. 
PRO.6.32	He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense. Whoever does so destroys himself. 
PRO.6.33	He will find disease and disgrace. His shame will never be wiped away. 
PRO.6.34	For jealousy enrages a man and he will show no mercy in the day of revenge. 
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any compensation, he will not consent, even if your bribe is great. 
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words and treasure my 
PRO.7.2	Keep my 
PRO.7.3	Bind them on your fingers, write them on the tablet of your heart. 
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your relative. 
PRO.7.5	They will keep you from a seducing woman, from the foreign woman with her seductive speech. 
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice. 
PRO.7.7	I saw among the naïve, I noticed among the youth, a young man lacking understanding, 
PRO.7.8	crossing the street near her corner, walking in the direction of her house, 
PRO.7.9	in the twilight of the evening, in the darkest hours of the night. 
PRO.7.10	All of a sudden, a woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute and with a cunning heart. 
PRO.7.11	She is loud and defiant. Her feet never stay at home— 
PRO.7.12	now in the streets, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks. 
PRO.7.13	So she grabs him and kisses him and with a brazen face says to him: 
PRO.7.14	“I had to sacrifice fellowship offerings; today I paid my vow. 
PRO.7.15	So I’ve come out to meet you, to seek your presence eagerly— and I found you! 
PRO.7.16	I have spread my couch with tapestry of dyed Egyptian linens. 
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s drink our fill of love till morning! Let’s delight ourselves with love. 
PRO.7.19	For my husband is not at home— he’s gone on a long journey. 
PRO.7.20	He took a bag of money with him— he won’t come home until full moon.” 
PRO.7.21	With her persistent pleading she entices him, with smooth talk she seduces him. 
PRO.7.22	Suddenly he follows her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a stag bounding toward a trap, 
PRO.7.23	till an arrow pierces its liver. Like a bird darting into a snare, he never considered his own soul! 
PRO.7.24	Now then, sons, listen to me, pay attention to the words of my mouth. 
PRO.7.25	Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray onto her paths. 
PRO.7.26	For many are the victims she has brought down, and numerous are all her slain. 
PRO.7.27	Her house is a highway to 
PRO.8.1	Does not wisdom cry out, and understanding lift her voice? 
PRO.8.2	On the topmost heights along the way, at the crossroads, she takes her stand. 
PRO.8.3	Beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud: 
PRO.8.4	“To you, O men, I call out! My cry is to all mankind! 
PRO.8.5	O naïve ones, learn prudence! Fools, gain understanding! 
PRO.8.6	Listen, for I speak excellent things, and my lips utter right things. 
PRO.8.7	For my mouth speaks truth, and my lips detest wickedness. 
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are righteous, Nothing in them is perverse or crooked. 
PRO.8.9	All of them are straightforward to the discerning, and right to those who find knowledge. 
PRO.8.10	Receive my instruction instead of silver and knowledge rather than choice gold. 
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than jewels, nothing you desire compares with her. 
PRO.8.12	“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and acquire knowledge with discretion. 
PRO.8.13	To fear 
PRO.8.14	Counsel and sound wisdom are mine. I have understanding and power. 
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign and princes decree justice. 
PRO.8.16	By me princes govern, and all nobles who judge righteously. 
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me. Those who earnestly seek me find me. 
PRO.8.18	With me are wealth and honor, enduring riches and righteousness. 
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than refined gold, my harvest better than choice silver. 
PRO.8.20	I walk in the way of righteousness, along paths of justice. 
PRO.8.21	I endow substance to those who love me and fill their treasuries. 
PRO.8.22	“
PRO.8.23	From eternity I was appointed from the beginning, before the world began. 
PRO.8.24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water. 
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth. 
PRO.8.26	He had not yet made the land, the fields, or the first dust of the earth. 
PRO.8.27	 When He set the heavens in place, I was there. When He inscribed the horizon on the face of the ocean, 
PRO.8.28	when He established the skies above, when He securely fixed the fountains of the deep, 
PRO.8.29	when He set the boundaries for the sea, so that the waters never transgress His command, when He laid out earth’s foundations— 
PRO.8.30	then I was the craftsman beside Him, I was His daily delight, always rejoicing before Him, 
PRO.8.31	 rejoicing in His whole world, and delighting in mankind. 
PRO.8.32	“So now, children, listen to me! Blessed are those who keep my ways. 
PRO.8.33	Heed discipline and be wise, and do not neglect it. 
PRO.8.34	Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts. 
PRO.8.35	For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from 
PRO.8.36	But whoever fails to find me harms his life— all who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars. 
PRO.9.2	She has slaughtered her meat, she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. 
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her servant girls. She calls from the city’s heights: 
PRO.9.4	“Whoever is naïve, turn in here!” To those who lack understanding, she says: 
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed. 
PRO.9.6	Abandon your foolish ways and live! Walk in the way of understanding.” 
PRO.9.7	Whoever corrects a scoffer is asking for insult. Whoever reproves a wicked man gets abuse. 
PRO.9.8	Do not correct a scoffer or he will hate you. Rebuke a wise man and he will love you. 
PRO.9.9	Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still. Teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning. 
PRO.9.10	The fear of 
PRO.9.11	For through me your days will be many and years will be added to your life. 
PRO.9.12	If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage, but if you scoff, you bear it alone. 
PRO.9.13	The foolish woman is rowdy. She is naïve and knows nothing. 
PRO.9.14	So she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city, 
PRO.9.15	calling to those who pass by, who go straight on their way: 
PRO.9.16	“Whoever is naïve, let him turn in here.” To those who lack understanding, she says: 
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water is sweet and bread eaten in secret is delicious!” 
PRO.9.18	But he does not know that the dead are there— her guests are in the depths of 
PRO.10.1	The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son gives joy to his father, but a foolish son grief to his mother. 
PRO.10.2	Ill-gotten treasures profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death. 
PRO.10.3	 will not let a righteous soul go hungry, but thwarts the cravings of the wicked. 
PRO.10.4	Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth. 
PRO.10.5	He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.
PRO.10.6	Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 
PRO.10.7	The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot. 
PRO.10.8	The wise in heart accept commands, but a babbling fool comes to ruin. 
PRO.10.9	One who walks in integrity, walks securely, but one who takes crooked paths will be discovered. 
PRO.10.10	One who winks an eye maliciously causes grief, while a babbling fool comes to ruin. 
PRO.10.11	The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up strife but love covers up all transgressions. 
PRO.10.13	Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one lacking sense. 
PRO.10.14	Wise men store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool is near ruin. 
PRO.10.15	The wealth of a rich man is a strong city. Poverty is the ruin of the poor. 
PRO.10.16	The wages of the righteous are life. The income of the wicked is sin. 
PRO.10.17	One who heeds discipline is on the path of life, but whoever ignores correction goes astray. 
PRO.10.18	One who conceals hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is a fool. 
PRO.10.19	When words abound, transgression is unavoidable. but whoever restrains his lips is wise. 
PRO.10.20	The tongue of the righteous is choice silver. The heart of the wicked is of little value. 
PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of understanding. 
PRO.10.22	The blessing of 
PRO.10.23	As doing wickedness is delight to a fool, so is wisdom to a man of discernment. 
PRO.10.24	What the wicked dread will fall on them. The desire of the righteous will be given. 
PRO.10.25	When the whirlwind passes, the wicked are no more, but the foundation of the righteous is everlasting. 
PRO.10.26	Like vinegar to the teeth or smoke to the eyes, so is a slacker to those who send him. 
PRO.10.27	The fear of 
PRO.10.28	The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hope of the wicked perishes. 
PRO.10.29	The way of 
PRO.10.30	The righteous will never be uprooted, but the wicked will not dwell in the land. 
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the righteous bears the fruit of wisdom, but a perverse tongue will be cut out. 
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know what is pleasing, but the mouth of the wicked is perverse. 
PRO.11.1	Dishonest scales are an abomination to 
PRO.11.2	When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom. 
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous will destroy them. 
PRO.11.4	Riches make no profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. 
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the blameless man makes his way straight, but the wicked man is brought down by his wickedness. 
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the treacherous are trapped by their desire.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked dies, his hope perishes, and the hope of the strong vanishes. 
PRO.11.8	The righteous is rescued from trouble. Instead it comes on the wicked. 
PRO.11.9	With his mouth the ungodly destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous will be delivered. 
PRO.11.10	When the righteous do well, a city rejoices. When the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy. 
PRO.11.11	Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed. 
PRO.11.12	One who despises his neighbor lacks sense, but one with discernment remains silent. 
PRO.11.13	A gossip reveals secrets, but one who is trustworthy conceals a matter. 
PRO.11.14	Without guidance people fall, with many counselors there is deliverance. 
PRO.11.15	Whoever puts up security for a stranger will have trouble, but whoever avoids shaking hands on such a deal is secure. 
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman gains honor, but ruthless men seize riches. 
PRO.11.17	A kind man does his own soul good, but a cruel man harms his own flesh. 
PRO.11.18	The wicked earn deceptive wages, but a sower of righteousness reaps a true reward. 
PRO.11.19	Steadfast righteousness leads to life, but pursuing evil ends in death. 
PRO.11.20	Perverse hearts are an abomination to 
PRO.11.21	Be sure, the evil will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered. 
PRO.11.22	Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. 
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous is only good, but the hope of the wicked only wrath. 
PRO.11.24	One gives freely, yet gains even more. Another withholds unjustly, and comes to poverty. 
PRO.11.25	A soul who blesses will prosper, and one who gives water will himself be satisfied. 
PRO.11.26	People curse anyone withholding grain, but blessing is on the head of one who dispenses it. 
PRO.11.27	A person who diligently seeks good finds favor, but to one who searches for evil, evil comes to him! 
PRO.11.28	Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf. 
PRO.11.29	Whoever troubles his own household will inherit wind, and the fool will be a servant to the wise-hearted. 
PRO.11.30	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever wins souls is wise. 
PRO.11.31	If the righteous is rewarded on earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner! 
PRO.12.1	Whoever loves knowledge loves correction, but whoever hates reproof is stupid. 
PRO.12.2	A good man obtains favor from 
PRO.12.3	No one is made secure by wickedness, but a righteous root will not be moved. 
PRO.12.4	A virtuous wife is her husband’s crown, but a dishonoring one is like rottenness in his bones. 
PRO.12.5	The plans of the righteous are just, but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful. 
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers them. 
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the household of the righteous will stand. 
PRO.12.8	A man is praised according to his insight, but one with a twisted mind is despised. 
PRO.12.9	Better to have little honor and a servant than to have glory and no bread. 
PRO.12.10	A righteous person cares for the life of his animal, yet even the compassion of the wicked is cruel. 
PRO.12.11	The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases daydreams lacks sense. 
PRO.12.12	The wicked covets the loot of evil men, but the root of the righteous flourishes.
PRO.12.13	An evil one is ensnared by the sin of lips, but the righteous one escapes trouble. 
PRO.12.14	By the fruit of his mouth a man will be satisfied with good. The work of a man’s hands will reward him. 
PRO.12.15	A fool’s way is right in his own eyes, but the wise listen to advice. 
PRO.12.16	A fool shows his irritation immediately, but a prudent person overlooks an insult. 
PRO.12.17	A trustworthy witness tells what is right, but a false witness, deceit. 
PRO.12.18	Reckless speech is like the thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. 
PRO.12.19	Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue for only a moment. 
PRO.12.20	Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, but those promoting 
PRO.12.21	No harm befalls the righteous, but the wicked are full of misery. 
PRO.12.22	Lying lips are detestable to 
PRO.12.23	A clever person conceals his knowledge, but the heart of a fool blurts out folly. 
PRO.12.24	The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy will become forced labor. 
PRO.12.25	An anxious heart weighs one down, but a good word cheers him up. 
PRO.12.26	The righteous gives his friend guidance, but the way of the wicked leads astray. 
PRO.12.27	A lazy person does not roast his game, but a diligent person prizes his possessions. 
PRO.12.28	In the path of righteousness is life— it is a path to immortality.
PRO.13.1	A wise son heeds his father’s discipline, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. 
PRO.13.2	From the fruit of a man’s mouth he enjoys good things, but the treacherous crave violence. 
PRO.13.3	He who watches his mouth protects his life, but whoever opens wide his lips comes to ruin.

PRO.13.9	The light of the righteous shines brightly. The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.

PRO.13.12	Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but longing fulfilled is a tree of life.

PRO.13.14	Wise instruction is a fountain of life, turning one away from snares of death. 
PRO.13.15	Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the unfaithful is hard. 
PRO.13.16	Everyone shrewd acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts folly. 
PRO.13.17	A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a faithful envoy brings healing. 
PRO.13.18	He who spurns discipline comes to poverty and shame, but whoever accepts correction will be honored. 
PRO.13.19	A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning away from evil.

PRO.14.7	Walk away from a fool— for you will find no knowledge on his lips. 
PRO.14.8	The wisdom of the prudent is to consider his way, but the folly of fools is deception. 
PRO.14.9	Fools mock guilt of sin, but among the upright is goodwill. 
PRO.14.10	The heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joy. 
PRO.14.11	The house of the wicked will be demolished, but the tent of the upright will flourish. 
PRO.14.12	There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. 
PRO.14.13	Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be grief. 
PRO.14.14	A backsliding heart partakes of its ways, and a good man is rewarded for his. 
PRO.14.15	The naïve believes every word, but the shrewd discerns his steps. 
PRO.14.16	The wise fears and turns away from evil, but the fool is hotheaded and reckless. 
PRO.14.17	One with a short temper acts foolishly, and one with crafty schemes is hated. 
PRO.14.18	The naïve inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 
PRO.14.19	Evil men will bow in the presence of the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
PRO.14.20	The poor is hated even by his neighbor, but many are those who love the rich.

PRO.24.11	Rescue those being dragged off to death, hold back those stumbling to slaughter. 
PRO.24.12	If you say, “Look, we didn’t know this.” Won’t He who weighs hearts perceive it? Won’t He who guards your soul know it? Won’t He repay each one according to his deeds? 
PRO.24.13	Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and honeycomb is sweet to your taste. 
PRO.24.14	Likewise know that wisdom is sweet to your soul. If you find it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 
PRO.24.15	Do not lurk like the wicked near the dwelling of the righteous. Do not assault his home. 
PRO.24.16	For though the righteous one may fall seven times, he gets up again, but the wicked stumble in adversity. 
PRO.24.17	Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, or let your heart be glad when he stumbles, 
PRO.24.18	or 
PRO.24.19	Do not be upset because of evil people, or be envious of the wicked, 
PRO.24.20	for the evil person has no future, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. 
PRO.24.21	My son, fear 
PRO.24.22	For their destruction will arise suddenly, and who knows the ruin both 
PRO.24.23	These sayings are also from the wise: Partiality in judgment is not good. 
PRO.24.24	Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent,” people curse him and nations revile him. 
PRO.24.25	But for those who convict the guilty there will be delight— good blessing will come upon them. 
PRO.24.26	An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. 
PRO.24.27	Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready. After that, build your house. 
PRO.24.28	Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips. 
PRO.24.29	Do not say, “I will do to him what he has done to me; I will pay him back for his deed!”
PRO.24.30	I passed by the field of the slacker, by the vineyard of one lacking judgment. 
PRO.24.31	Surprisingly, it was all overgrown with thorns, the ground was covered with weeds, and its stone wall was broken down. 
PRO.24.32	Then I took to heart what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw: 
PRO.24.33	“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,” 
PRO.24.34	then your poverty comes tramping in, and your need like an armed soldier.
PRO.25.1	These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: 
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to search it out. 
PRO.25.3	As high as heaven and deep as earth, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. 
PRO.25.4	Remove impurities from silver and out comes material for the refiner. 
PRO.25.5	Remove the wicked from before the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness. 
PRO.25.6	Do not honor yourself in the king’s presence, and do not stand in the place of great men. 
PRO.25.7	Better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” than for you to be humiliated before a nobleman. What your eyes have seen, 
PRO.25.8	do not bring hastily to court, or what will you do afterward, when your neighbor puts you to shame? 
PRO.25.9	Argue your case with your associate, without betraying another’s confidence, 
PRO.25.10	or the one who hears it will shame you, and you will never lose your bad reputation.
PRO.25.11	Like apples of gold in settings of silver is a word aptly spoken. 
PRO.25.12	Like a gold earring or a gold ornament is a wise reproof to a receptive ear. 
PRO.25.13	Like the coolness of snow at harvest time is a faithful messenger to those who send him for he refreshes his master’s soul. 
PRO.25.14	Like clouds and wind without rain is one who boasts about a gift not given. 
PRO.25.15	Through patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue can break a bone.
PRO.25.16	When you find honey, eat just enough, lest you are stuffed and vomit it. 
PRO.25.17	Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house, lest he become weary of you and loathe you. 
PRO.25.18	Like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow is one who bears false witness against his neighbor. 
PRO.25.19	Like a broken tooth or a lame foot is confidence in the unfaithful in time of trouble. 
PRO.25.20	Like taking off a garment on a cold day or like vinegar poured on soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. 
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, 
PRO.25.22	for you will heap coals of fire on his head and 
PRO.25.23	A north wind brings rain, and a backbiting tongue angry faces. 
PRO.25.24	Better to dwell in a corner of a roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. 
PRO.25.25	Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land. 
PRO.25.26	Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous person who yields before the wicked. 
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat too much honey, or honorable to seek one’s own honor. 
PRO.25.28	Like a city whose walls are broken down is one with no control over his temper.
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer or rain at harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool. 
PRO.26.2	Like a fluttering sparrow or a flying swallow, so an undeserved curse does not land. 
PRO.26.3	A whip for a horse, a bridle for a donkey, and a rod for the back of fools. 
PRO.26.4	Do not answer a fool according to his folly, else you also will be like him. 
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly, else he will be wise in his own eyes. 
PRO.26.6	Like cutting off one’s feet or drinking violence is sending a message by a fool’s hand. 
PRO.26.7	Like a lame man’s legs that hang limp, so is a proverb in a fool’s mouth. 
PRO.26.8	Like tying a stone into a sling, so is giving honor to a fool. 
PRO.26.9	Like a thorn bush in a drunkard’s hand is a proverb in a fool’s mouth. 
PRO.26.10	Like an archer who wounds at random is one who hires a fool or any passer-by. 
PRO.26.11	Like a dog that returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly. 
PRO.26.12	Do you see one wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than him.
PRO.26.13	A slacker says, “There’s a lion on the road! A lion is in the streets!” 
PRO.26.14	As a door turns on its hinges so a slacker turns on his bed. 
PRO.26.15	The slacker plunges his hand in the dish— he is too tired to bring it back to his mouth. 
PRO.26.16	A slacker is wiser in his own eyes than seven people who answer sensibly. 
PRO.26.17	Like one who takes a dog by the ears is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel not his own. 
PRO.26.18	Like a madman shooting firebrands and deadly arrows 
PRO.26.19	so is one who deceives his friend, and says, “I was only joking.” 
PRO.26.20	Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip quarrels cease. 
PRO.26.21	As coals are to embers and wood to fire, so is a contentious person to kindling strife. 
PRO.26.22	A gossip’s words are like tasty morsels— they slide down into the innermost parts of the body. 
PRO.26.23	Like silver glaze overlaying earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart. 
PRO.26.24	One who hates, disguises it with his lips, but he stores up deceit within him. 
PRO.26.25	When he speaks favorably, do not believe him, for there are seven abominations in his heart. 
PRO.26.26	Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit, his evil will be exposed before the assembly. 
PRO.26.27	Whoever digs a pit will fall in it, and whoever rolls a stone— it will come back upon him. 
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those crushed by it, and a flattering mouth causes ruin. 
PRO.27.1	Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. 
PRO.27.2	Let another praise you and not your own mouth, a stranger and not your own lips. 
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both. 
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? 
PRO.27.5	Better is open rebuke than hidden love. 
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but excessive the kisses of an enemy. 
PRO.27.7	One who is full loathes honeycomb, but to one who is hungry every bitter thing is sweet. 
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man that wanders from his home.
PRO.27.9	As ointment and perfume gladden the heart, so the sweetness of one’s friend comes from his sincere counsel. 
PRO.27.10	Do not forsake your friend, or your father’s friend, nor go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster— better a neighbor nearby than a brother far off. 
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my son, make my heart glad, so I may answer anyone who taunts me. 
PRO.27.12	The prudent see danger and hide, but the naïve keep going and pay the penalty. 
PRO.27.13	Take a man’s garment, who puts up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge, as security for a seductive woman. 
PRO.27.14	If someone blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse. 
PRO.27.15	Continual dripping on a day of steady rain and a contentious wife are alike— 
PRO.27.16	hiding her is like hiding the wind or grasping oil with the right hand. 
PRO.27.17	As iron sharpens iron, so a person sharpens the countenance of his friend. 
PRO.27.18	Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, whoever takes care of his master will be honored. 
PRO.27.19	As water reflects the face, so a person’s heart reflects the person. 
PRO.27.20	 and Abaddon are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man. 
PRO.27.21	A crucible is for silver and a furnace is for gold, but a person is proved by the praise he receives. 
PRO.27.22	Even if you pound the fool along with the grain in a mortar with a pestle, his foolishness would never leave him. 
PRO.27.23	Know well the condition of your flocks, pay attention to your herds, 
PRO.27.24	for riches are not forever, nor a crown from generation to generation. 
PRO.27.25	When hay is removed and grass appears, and grain from the hills is gathered in, 
PRO.27.26	lambs will provide you with clothing, and goats with the price of a field. 
PRO.27.27	There will be enough goats’ milk for food and food for your household, and sustenance for your maidservants. 
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no one is pursuing, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. 
PRO.28.2	When a country is in rebellion, it has many rulers, but a man of discernment and knowledge maintains order. 
PRO.28.3	A poor man who oppresses the weak is like pounding rain without food. 
PRO.28.4	Those who forsake 
PRO.28.5	Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek 
PRO.28.6	Better the poor who walks in his integrity than the rich whose ways are crooked. 
PRO.28.7	He who keeps 
PRO.28.8	Whoever increases his wealth by exorbitant interest, gathers it for one kinder to the poor. 
PRO.28.9	One who turns his ear from hearing 
PRO.28.10	One who leads the upright astray along an evil path will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit good. 
PRO.28.11	A rich person is wise in his own eyes, but a discerning poor person sees through him. 
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph there is great glory, but when the wicked rise to power, people hide. 
PRO.28.13	One who covers up his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. 
PRO.28.14	Blessed is one who is always cautious, but whoever hardens his heart will fall into trouble. 
PRO.28.15	Like a roaring lion or a prowling bear is a wicked ruler over helpless people. 
PRO.28.16	An oppressive leader lacks judgment. One who hates unjust gain will prolong his life. 
PRO.28.17	A man tormented by the guilt of murder flees to the Pit—let no one support him. 
PRO.28.18	Whoever walks blamelessly will be safe, but whoever is perverse in his ways will fall suddenly.
PRO.28.19	Whoever works his land will be satisfied with food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. 
PRO.28.20	A faithful man will have many blessings, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. 
PRO.28.21	To show partiality is not good— yet for a piece of bread a man may do wrong. 
PRO.28.22	A stingy man chases after riches, but does not know that poverty will overtake him. 
PRO.28.23	One who rebukes a man will in the end find more favor than one with a flattering tongue. 
PRO.28.24	Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, “It’s not a crime,” is a partner to him who destroys. 
PRO.28.25	A greedy soul stirs up strife, but one who trusts in 
PRO.28.26	Whoever trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will escape. 
PRO.28.27	One who gives to the poor will not lack, but one who shuts his eyes will have many curses. 
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise to power, people hide, but when they perish, the righteous increase.
PRO.29.1	One who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed— without remedy. 
PRO.29.2	When the righteous thrive, people rejoice. When the wicked rule, people groan. 
PRO.29.3	Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. 
PRO.29.4	By justice a king brings stability to a land, but one who takes bribes brings it ruin. 
PRO.29.5	A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet. 
PRO.29.6	In an evil man’s wrongdoing is a trap, but the righteous sings and rejoices. 
PRO.29.7	A righteous person considers justice for the poor. The wicked one has no such concern. 
PRO.29.8	Mockers incite a city, but wise men turn away anger. 
PRO.29.9	If a wise man argues with a foolish man, he rants or laughs, with no resolution. 
PRO.29.10	Bloodthirsty people hate a man of integrity and seek the soul of the upright. 
PRO.29.11	A fool gives full vent to his temper, but a wise man holds it back. 
PRO.29.12	If a ruler listens to lies, all his servants will be wicked. 
PRO.29.13	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: 
PRO.29.14	If a king judges the poor with truth, his throne will always be secure. 
PRO.29.15	A rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother. 
PRO.29.16	When the wicked thrive, wrongdoing increases, but the righteous will see their downfall. 
PRO.29.17	Correct your son and he will give you rest. He will bring delight to your soul. 
PRO.29.18	Where there is no divine vision people cast off restraint, but blessed is the one who keeps 
PRO.29.19	A servant cannot be corrected by words, for though he understands, he will not respond. 
PRO.29.20	Do you see someone hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than him. 
PRO.29.21	If someone pampers his slave from childhood in the end he will be ungrateful. 
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirs up dissention, and a hotheaded one commits many transgressions. 
PRO.29.23	A man’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will gain honor. 
PRO.29.24	An accomplice of a thief is his own enemy. He hears the oath but says nothing. 
PRO.29.25	Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but one who trusts in 
PRO.29.26	Many seek an audience with a ruler, but from 
PRO.29.27	The righteous detest the unjust, and the wicked detest the upright.
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur son of Jakeh— an oracle this man declared to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ucal: 
PRO.30.2	“Surely I am more stupid than any man and do not have a man’s understanding. 
PRO.30.3	I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One. 
PRO.30.4	Who has gone up into heaven, and come down? Who has gathered the wind in the palm of His hand? Who has wrapped the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name and what is the name of His son—if you know?” 
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is purified. He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. 
PRO.30.6	Do not add to His words, or else He will rebuke You and prove you a liar. 
PRO.30.7	Two things I ask of You— do not refuse me before I die: 
PRO.30.8	Keep falsehood and lies far from me. Give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with my allotted bread, 
PRO.30.9	lest I become satisfied and deny You and say, “Who is 
PRO.30.10	Do not slander a servant to his master, or he will curse you, and you pay for it. 
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that curses its father and does not bless its mother. 
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, and yet is not cleansed from its filth. 
PRO.30.13	There is a generation whose eyes are so haughty, whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully. 
PRO.30.14	There is a generation whose teeth are swords and whose molars are knives, to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among humanity. 
PRO.30.15	The leech has two daughters: “Give! Give!” Three things are never satisfied, four never say, “Enough!”— 
PRO.30.16	, a barren womb, land that is not satisfied with water, and fire that never says, “Enough!” 
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks a father and scorns obeying a mother— will be pecked out by ravens of the valley and eaten by young vultures! 
PRO.30.18	Three things are too amazing for me, four I do not understand: 
PRO.30.19	the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the heart of the sea, and the way of a man with a maiden. 
PRO.30.20	Such is the way of an adulteress: she eats, wipes her mouth and says, “I have done nothing wrong.” 
PRO.30.21	Under three things the earth trembles, and under four it cannot bear up: 
PRO.30.22	under a slave when he becomes a king, a fool when he is stuffed with food, 
PRO.30.23	an unloved woman when she is married, and a handmaid when she displaces her mistress.
PRO.30.24	Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise: 
PRO.30.25	ants are creatures with little strength, yet they store up their food in summer; 
PRO.30.26	coneys are creatures with little power, yet they make their homes in the cliffs; 
PRO.30.27	locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks; 
PRO.30.28	a lizard you can catch with the hand, yet it is found in kings’ palaces. 
PRO.30.29	Three things are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing: 
PRO.30.30	a lion, mighty among beasts, who never backs down from anything; 
PRO.30.31	a strutting rooster, a male-goat, and a king with his army around him. 
PRO.30.32	If you have acted foolishly, exalting yourself, or if you have planned evil, put your hand over your mouth. 
PRO.30.33	For as churning milk produces butter, and twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife. 
PRO.31.1	The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him: 
PRO.31.2	O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, 
PRO.31.3	do not give your vigor to women, or your ways to what ruins kings. 
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink, 
PRO.31.5	lest they drink, forget what is decreed, and pervert justice for all the oppressed. 
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink to one who is dying, and wine to those who are bitterly distressed— 
PRO.31.7	let him drink, forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak, for the justice of all who are destitute. 
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, judge righteously, plead the cause of the poor and needy.
PRO.31.10	An accomplished woman who can find? Her value is far beyond rubies. 
PRO.31.11	Her husband’s heart trusts in her, and he lacks nothing valuable. 
PRO.31.12	She brings him good and not harm all the days of her life. 
PRO.31.13	She selects wool and flax and her hands work willingly. 
PRO.31.14	She is like merchant ships, bringing her sustenance from afar. 
PRO.31.15	She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and portions for her servant girls. 
PRO.31.16	She considers a field and buys it. From the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. 
PRO.31.17	She girds herself with strength and invigorates her arms. 
PRO.31.18	She discerns that her business is good. Her lamp never goes out at night. 
PRO.31.19	She extends her hands to the spindle and her palm grasps the spinning wheel. 
PRO.31.20	She spreads out her palms to the poor, and extends her hands to the needy. 
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of snow for her house, for her whole household is clothed in scarlet wool. 
PRO.31.22	She makes her own luxurious coverings. Her clothing is fine linen and purple. 
PRO.31.23	Her husband is respected at the city gates, when he sits among the elders of the land. 
PRO.31.24	She makes linen garments and sells them and supplies sashes to the merchants. 
PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the days to come. 
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth with wisdom— a lesson of kindness is on her tongue. 
PRO.31.27	She watches over the affairs of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness. 
PRO.31.28	Her children arise and bless her, her husband also praises her: 
PRO.31.29	“Many daughters have excelled, but you surpass them all.” 
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears 
PRO.31.31	Give her the fruit of her hands. Let her deeds be her praise at the gates.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. Now that man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 
JOB.1.2	He had seven sons and three daughters 
JOB.1.3	and his possessions were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen and 500 female donkeys, and a very large household. That man was the greatest of all the people of the East. 
JOB.1.4	Now it was customary for his sons to hold a banquet, each on his own day in his own house. They would send to invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	When the round of banquet days was completed, Job would send for them and consecrate them. He would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings, according to the number of them all. For Job said, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did everyday.
JOB.1.6	One day the sons of God came to present themselves before 
JOB.1.7	 said to the satan, “Where have you come from?” The satan responded to 
JOB.1.8	 said to the satan, “Did you notice my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth—a blameless and upright man, who fears God and spurns evil.” 
JOB.1.9	Then the satan responded to 
JOB.1.10	Have you not made a hedge around him, his household, and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But now, stretch out Your hand and strike everything he has, and he will certainly curse You to Your face!” 
JOB.1.12	Then 
JOB.1.13	One day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing near them, 
JOB.1.15	when the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They also killed the servants with the edge of the sword—I alone escaped to tell you!” 
JOB.1.16	While this one was still speaking another came in and said, “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and servants—it has consumed them, and I—I alone—escaped to tell you!” 
JOB.1.17	While this one was still speaking another came in and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and raided the camels and took them all away. They also killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!” 
JOB.1.18	While this one was still speaking another came in and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine at their oldest brother’s house 
JOB.1.19	when suddenly a mighty wind came from beyond the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it collapsed on the young people and they died. And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!” 
JOB.1.20	Then Job got up, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell to the ground and worshiped. 
JOB.1.21	Then he said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. 
JOB.1.22	Through all this, Job did not sin nor did he cast reproach on God. 
JOB.2.1	Again the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before 
JOB.2.2	 said to him, “Where are you coming from?” The satan answered 
JOB.2.3	Then 
JOB.2.4	The satan replied to 
JOB.2.5	But now, stretch out Your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will certainly curse You to Your face!” 
JOB.2.6	 said to the satan, “Very well, he is in your hand—only spare his life!” 
JOB.2.7	So the satan departed from the presence of 
JOB.2.8	He took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes. 
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said to him, “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God and die!” 
JOB.2.10	He said to her, “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Should we accept the good from God and not accept the bad?” Through all this Job did not sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	When Job’s three friends heard about all this calamity that had come upon him, each of them came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come and mourn with him and to comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	But when they saw him from a distance they did not recognize him, and they raised their voices and wept. Each one tore his robe and threw dust into the air onto their heads. 
JOB.2.13	Then they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights. No one spoke a word to him because they saw that his pain was very great. 
JOB.3.1	After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day. 
JOB.3.2	Then Job answered and said: 
JOB.3.3	“May the day I was born perish, and the night that said, ‘A man is conceived!’ 
JOB.3.4	That day—may it be darkness; may God above not regard it; may no light shine on it. 
JOB.3.5	May darkness and deep gloom reclaim it; may a cloud settle over it; may whatever blackens the day terrify it. 
JOB.3.6	That night—may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year, nor be entered among the number of months. 
JOB.3.7	Indeed, may that night be barren; may no joyful shout enter it. 
JOB.3.8	May those who curse, curse the day— those ready to awaken Leviathan. 
JOB.3.9	May its morning stars be darkened; may it hope for light but have none— may it never see the eyelids of dawn. 
JOB.3.10	For it did not shut the doors of the womb on me, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 
JOB.3.11	Why did I not die at birth and expire as I exited the womb? 
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees welcome me, and breasts that I might nurse? 
JOB.3.13	For now I would be lying down and quiet; I would be asleep and at rest 
JOB.3.14	with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now desolate, 
JOB.3.15	with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 
JOB.3.16	Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn, like infants who never saw light? 
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest. 
JOB.3.18	Prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster. 
JOB.3.19	Small and great are there; and slave is free from his master. 
JOB.3.20	Why is light given to one who suffers and life to the bitter of soul, 
JOB.3.21	to those who long for death, but it does not come, who dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 
JOB.3.22	who are filled with gladness and rejoice when finding the grave? 
JOB.3.23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in? 
JOB.3.24	For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groans pour out like water. 
JOB.3.25	For the thing I dreaded has come upon me, and what I feared has happened to me. 
JOB.3.26	I have no ease, no quietness; I have no rest, but turmoil came.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded and said: 
JOB.4.2	“If one attempts a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can keep from speaking? 
JOB.4.3	Behold, you have instructed many; you have strengthened weak hands. 
JOB.4.4	Your words have supported those who stumbled, and strengthened buckling knees. 
JOB.4.5	Yet now it has come to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed. 
JOB.4.6	Is not your piety your confidence, the integrity of your ways your hope? 
JOB.4.7	Reflect now: Who, being innocent, ever perished? And where were the upright destroyed? 
JOB.4.8	As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow harm, reap them. 
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish; by the blast of His anger they vanish. 
JOB.4.10	The lion may roar and the cub growl, but the teeth of young lions are broken. 
JOB.4.11	The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey and the lioness’ cubs are scattered.
JOB.4.12	Now a word was secretly brought to me, and my ear caught a whisper of it. 
JOB.4.13	Amid unsettling visions in the night, when a deep sleep falls on men, 
JOB.4.14	dread and trembling seized me, and made my bones shake. 
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit brushed over my face, and the hair of my flesh stood on end. 
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I could not recognize its appearance, A form was before my eyes and I heard a murmur, a voice: 
JOB.4.17	‘Can a mortal be righteous before God; or a man pure before his Creator? 
JOB.4.18	If He puts no trust in His servants and accuses His angels of error, 
JOB.4.19	how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth? 
JOB.4.20	From morning until evening they are beaten into pieces— unnoticed, they perish forever. 
JOB.4.21	Is not their tent cord pulled out, so that they die without wisdom.’”
JOB.5.1	“Cry out now! Will anyone answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 
JOB.5.2	For resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple. 
JOB.5.3	I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling. 
JOB.5.4	His sons are far from safety, and crushed at the gate without a deliverer! 
JOB.5.5	The hungry consumes his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pants after their wealth. 
JOB.5.6	For evil does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground. 
JOB.5.7	Yet man is born for trouble, as surely as sparks fly upward. 
JOB.5.8	But as for me, I would seek God; I would lay my cause before God. 
JOB.5.9	Who does great things beyond comprehension, wonders without number. 
JOB.5.10	Who gives rain to the earth and sends water over the plains. 
JOB.5.11	Who places the lowly on high and lifts mourners to salvation. 
JOB.5.12	Who frustrates the plans of the crafty, so that their hands attain no success. 
JOB.5.13	Who catches the clever in their craftiness, and thwarts the plan of the cunning. 
JOB.5.14	By day they encounter darkness and grope at noon as if it were night. 
JOB.5.15	But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, and from the clutches of the mighty. 
JOB.5.16	So the helpless have hope and injustice shuts its mouth. 
JOB.5.17	Behold, happy is the one whom God corrects, so do not despise the discipline of Shaddai. 
JOB.5.18	For He inflicts pain, but He also binds up; He injures, yet His hands also heal. 
JOB.5.19	From six calamities He will deliver you, even in seven, no harm will touch you. 
JOB.5.20	In famine, He will redeem you from death, and in war, from the power of the sword. 
JOB.5.21	You will be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and not fear when violence comes. 
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at violence and famine, and will not fear the beasts of the earth. 
JOB.5.23	For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you. 
JOB.5.24	You will know 
JOB.5.25	“You will know that your descendants will be numerous your offspring like the grass of the earth. 
JOB.5.26	You will come to the grave in vigor, like sheaves of grain in its season. 
JOB.5.27	Behold, we have investigated this— it is true. Hear it, and apply it to yourself!”
JOB.6.1	Job responded and said: 
JOB.6.2	“If only my grief could be weighed and my calamity placed on the scales. 
JOB.6.3	For it outweighs the sands of the sea; that is why my words have been rash. 
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of 
JOB.6.5	Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass or an ox bellow over his fodder? 
JOB.6.6	Is something bland eaten without salt, is there taste in the white of an egg? 
JOB.6.7	My soul refuses to touch them; they are like sickening food to me. 
JOB.6.8	Oh that my request would be realized, that God would grant my hope; 
JOB.6.9	that God would be willing to crush me, to release His hand, and cut me off! 
JOB.6.10	Then I would still be comforted, even rejoice in spite of unrelenting pain, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 
JOB.6.11	“What is my strength, that I should hope? What is my end, that I should endure? 
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of rock? Is my flesh bronze? 
JOB.6.13	Is there no help within me; has not success been banished from me? 
JOB.6.14	“A despairing person should have the kindness of his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of Shaddai. 
JOB.6.15	My brothers have acted deceptively, as a seasonal stream, as a torrential stream that overflows 
JOB.6.16	when darkened by thawing ice, and obscured by snow, 
JOB.6.17	but when they are scorched, they dry up, and in the heat, they vanish from their place. 
JOB.6.18	Caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the wasteland and perish. 
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema looked intently, the travelers of Sheba hoped for them. 
JOB.6.20	They were distressed because they had been confident; they came so far and were disappointed. 
JOB.6.21	“Indeed, now you have become nothing; you see a terror and are afraid. 
JOB.6.22	Have I ever said, ‘Give to me’ or ‘Pay a bribe for me from your wealth’ 
JOB.6.23	or ‘Save me from the enemy’s hand’ or ‘Redeem me from a ruthless hand’? 
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will be silent; explain to me how I have been wrong. 
JOB.6.25	Honest words are painful, but what does your arguing prove? 
JOB.6.26	Do you intend to correct my words, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind? 
JOB.6.27	Would you cast lots for an orphan, and barter over your friend? 
JOB.6.28	“Now be so kind as to look at me; I will not lie to your face. 
JOB.6.29	Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my righteousness is in it. 
JOB.6.30	Is injustice on my tongue? Can my palate not discern evil?”
JOB.7.1	“Does not man have hard labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired laborer? 
JOB.7.2	Like a slave longing for the shadow, or a hired man waiting for his pay, 
JOB.7.3	so I have inherited months of futility, and nights of distress have been appointed to me. 
JOB.7.4	When I lay down I say, “When will I rise?” The night drags on, and I toss until the day dawns. 
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with maggots and clods of dirt; My skin is broken and festering. 
JOB.7.6	My days fly faster than a weaver’s shuttle and come to an end without hope. 
JOB.7.7	Remember, my life is but a breath; my eyes will not see goodness again! 
JOB.7.8	The eye that sees me now will see me no more; your eyes will be on me, but I will be no more. 
JOB.7.9	As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so one descending into 
JOB.7.10	he will never return to his house, his place does not know him. 
JOB.7.11	“So I will not keep silent; I will speak in the distress of my spirit, I will complain in bitterness of soul. 
JOB.7.12	Am I a sea, or a monster of the deep that You have set a watch over me? 
JOB.7.13	When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,’ 
JOB.7.14	then You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions, 
JOB.7.15	so that my soul prefers strangulation, and my bones death. 
JOB.7.16	I despise it; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a vapor. 
JOB.7.17	“What is mankind, that You magnify him, that You set Your heart on him, 
JOB.7.18	that You visit him every morning, and test him in every moment? 
JOB.7.19	Will You never look away from me, or let me alone until I swallow my spittle? 
JOB.7.20	Have I sinned— what have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target? Have I become a burden to You? 
JOB.7.21	Why do You not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, and You will search for me, but I will be gone.” 
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 
JOB.8.2	“How long will you say these things? The words of your mouth are like a mighty wind. 
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice? Does 
JOB.8.4	If your children sinned against Him, He handed them over to their rebellion. 
JOB.8.5	If you would seek God and plead with Shaddai, 
JOB.8.6	if you are pure and upright, even now He will awaken for you and restore your righteous abode. 
JOB.8.7	And though your beginning was small, your future would flourish. 
JOB.8.8	Now ask the previous generation; consider the findings of their fathers; 
JOB.8.9	for we were born yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow. 
JOB.8.10	Will they not teach you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their hearts? 
JOB.8.11	“Can papyrus grow tall without a marsh? Can reeds flourish without water? 
JOB.8.12	When still in bloom and uncut, it withers more quickly than other grass. 
JOB.8.13	Such are the ways of all who forget God; the hope of the godless perishes— 
JOB.8.14	whose confidence is snapped off, his trust is a spider’s web. 
JOB.8.15	He leans against his house but it does not stand, He holds fast to it, but it does not hold up. 
JOB.8.16	He is a well-watered plant in the sun, spreading his shoots over his garden; 
JOB.8.17	he entwines his roots around a heap of stones, and looks for a place between the rocks. 
JOB.8.18	If he is uprooted from his place, it denies him saying, ‘I never saw you.’ 
JOB.8.19	Such is his joyous course, and from the earth others spring up. 
JOB.8.20	Surely God does not spurn the blameless or strengthen the hand of evildoers. 
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy. 
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked will be no more!”
JOB.9.1	Job responded and said: 
JOB.9.2	“Truly I know it is so, but how can one be righteous before God? 
JOB.9.3	If anyone wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him once in a thousand. 
JOB.9.4	He is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and come out whole? 
JOB.9.5	“He who moves mountains, yet they do not know it, who overthrows them in His anger; 
JOB.9.6	who shakes the earth from its place until its pillars tremble; 
JOB.9.7	who speaks to the sun so it does not rise, and seals up the stars; 
JOB.9.8	He alone spreads out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea; 
JOB.9.9	He makes the Bear, Orion and Pleiades, and the constellations of the south; 
JOB.9.10	He does great and unfathomable things, wonders beyond number. 
JOB.9.11	If He were to pass by me, I would not see Him! Were He to move past me, I would not perceive Him. 
JOB.9.12	If He were to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’ 
JOB.9.13	“God does not restrain His anger; under Him the helpers of Rahab cower. 
JOB.9.14	How then can I answer Him or choose my words with Him? 
JOB.9.15	Even if I were right, I would not answer; I would implore the mercy of my Judge. 
JOB.9.16	Even if I called and He answered me, I would not believe that He would listen to my voice. 
JOB.9.17	He who crushes me with a storm and multiplies my wounds for no reason. 
JOB.9.18	He does not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 
JOB.9.19	If it is a question of strength— certainly, He is the mighty One! If it is a matter of justice— who will summon me? 
JOB.9.20	Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me. If I were guiltless, it will declare me perverse. 
JOB.9.21	“I am guiltless. I have no concern for myself. I despise my life. 
JOB.9.22	It is all the same, therefore I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ 
JOB.9.23	If a scourge smites suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent. 
JOB.9.24	If the land falls into the hand of the wicked He blindfolds the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it? 
JOB.9.25	“My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away without seeing goodness. 
JOB.9.26	They slip by like reed boats, like an eagle swooping down on its prey. 
JOB.9.27	If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and be cheerful,’ 
JOB.9.28	I still dread all my pains, for I know You will not find me innocent. 
JOB.9.29	If I am condemned— why should I struggle in vain? 
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with melted snow and cleanse my hands with lye, 
JOB.9.31	then You would plunge me into a pit and my own clothes would detest me. 
JOB.9.32	For He is not a human being, like I am, that I could answer Him, that we could go to court together. 
JOB.9.33	There is no arbitrator between us, who could lay his hand on us both; 
JOB.9.34	who could remove His rod from me, so that His terror would not frighten me. 
JOB.9.35	Then I would speak and not fear Him —except it is not so with me.”
JOB.10.1	“I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my complaint; I will speak out of the bitterness of my soul. 
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me; tell me why You contend with me.’ 
JOB.10.3	Is it good for You to oppress, to despise the work of Your hands, while You smile on the plans of the wicked? 
JOB.10.4	Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as a human being sees? 
JOB.10.5	Are Your days like those of a mortal, or Your years like those of a strong man, 
JOB.10.6	that You should seek out my iniquity and search out my sin, 
JOB.10.7	though You know that I am not guilty, yet there is no one to deliver from Your hand? 
JOB.10.8	“Your hands molded and fashioned me, will You now destroy me completely? 
JOB.10.9	Remember You fashioned me like clay; will You return me to dust? 
JOB.10.10	Did You not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese, 
JOB.10.11	clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews? 
JOB.10.12	You gave me life and steadfast love, and Your care has preserved my spirit. 
JOB.10.13	“Yet these things You have hid in Your heart, for I know that this is with You. 
JOB.10.14	If I sinned, You would watch me, and not acquit me of my iniquity. 
JOB.10.15	If I am guilty, woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head. I am full of shame and conscious of my affliction. 
JOB.10.16	If my head is held high, You hunt me like a lion, and again work wonders against me. 
JOB.10.17	You renew Your witnesses against me, and increase Your anger toward me, change and warfare are with me. 
JOB.10.18	“Why then did You bring me out from the womb? I should have died so no eye would have seen me. 
JOB.10.19	If only I had never come into being, or been carried from womb to grave. 
JOB.10.20	Are not my days few? Then stop, leave me alone so I might have a little joy, 
JOB.10.21	before I depart, and never return, to the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 
JOB.10.22	the land of utter darkness, like the deepest darkness and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”
JOB.11.1	Then, Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 
JOB.11.2	“Should so many words go unanswered? Is a man justified by his lips? 
JOB.11.3	Will your idle talk silence men and will no one rebuke you when you mock? 
JOB.11.4	For you have said, ‘My teaching is flawless’ and ‘I am pure in Your eyes!’ 
JOB.11.5	But if only God would speak and open His lips against you, 
JOB.11.6	and show you the secrets of wisdom— for sound wisdom has two sides. Know that God has forgotten some of your iniquity. 
JOB.11.7	“Can you discover the mysteries of God? Can you find the limits of Shaddai? 
JOB.11.8	They are higher than the heavens —what can you do? They are deeper than 
JOB.11.9	Its measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea. 
JOB.11.10	“If He comes by and imprisons, or convenes a court, who can prevent Him? 
JOB.11.11	For He knows deceitful men; when He sees wickedness, does he not consider it? 
JOB.11.12	But a witless man will gain understanding when a wild donkey’s colt is born a human being? 
JOB.11.13	“If you devote your heart to Him and spread out your hands to Him, 
JOB.11.14	if you put away the wickedness that is in your hand, and allow no iniquity to abide in your tent, 
JOB.11.15	then you will lift up your face without reproach; you will stand firm and without fear. 
JOB.11.16	You will forget your trouble; you will remember it like water that has flowed away. 
JOB.11.17	Life will be brighter than noonday; darkness like the morning. 
JOB.11.18	You will be confident, because there is hope; you will look about you and lie down in safety. 
JOB.11.19	You will lie down with no one to make you afraid, many will seek your favor. 
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their only hope is their dying breath.”
JOB.12.1	Job responded and said: 
JOB.12.2	“Without a doubt you are the people and wisdom will die with you! 
JOB.12.3	But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know these things? 
JOB.12.4	“I have become a laughingstock to my friend, though I called on God and He answered— a righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock! 
JOB.12.5	Contempt for calamity is the thought of one at ease, prepared for those whose foot slips. 
JOB.12.6	The tents of marauders prosper, and there is security for those who provoke God— for those whom God brings in His hand. 
JOB.12.7	But now ask the animals and they will teach you, or the birds of the sky and they will tell you, 
JOB.12.8	or speak to the earth and it will teach you, or the fish of the sea and they will inform you. 
JOB.12.9	Which of these does not know that the hand of 
JOB.12.10	In His hand is the life of every creature, and the breath of all the human race. 
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food? 
JOB.12.12	Is not wisdom with the aged and understanding bring long life? 
JOB.12.13	“With Him are wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are His. 
JOB.12.14	If He tears down, it cannot be rebuilt; one He imprisons cannot be released. 
JOB.12.15	If He holds back the waters, they dry up; if He releases them, they destroy the earth. 
JOB.12.16	With Him are power and sound wisdom; both deceived and deceiver are His. 
JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away stripped and makes judges into fools. 
JOB.12.18	He loosens the bonds of the kings, and binds a loincloth around their waists. 
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the rulers. 
JOB.12.20	He silences the lips of trusted advisors and removes the discernment of elders. 
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on nobles and loosens the belts of the mighty. 
JOB.12.22	He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings utter darkness into light. 
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great and destroys them. He enlarges the nations and leads them away. 
JOB.12.24	He deprives the heads of the people of earth of understanding, and causes them to wander in a pathless wasteland. 
JOB.12.25	They grope in darkness with no light; He makes them stagger like a drunkard.
JOB.13.1	“Indeed, my eye has seen it all, my ears have heard and understood it. 
JOB.13.2	What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 
JOB.13.3	Still, I desire to speak to 
JOB.13.4	You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless doctors—all of you! 
JOB.13.5	If only you would keep completely silent! For you, that would be wisdom. 
JOB.13.6	Hear now my argument; listen to the contentions of my lips. 
JOB.13.7	Will you speak unjustly on God’s behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for Him? 
JOB.13.8	Will you show Him partiality? Will you argue the case for God? 
JOB.13.9	Would it turn out well if He examined you? Could you deceive Him as you deceive a man? 
JOB.13.10	He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed favoritism. 
JOB.13.11	Would not His majesty terrify you and the dread of Him fall on you? 
JOB.13.12	Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. 
JOB.13.13	Be silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may. 
JOB.13.14	Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and take my life in my hands? 
JOB.13.15	Even if He slays me, I will wait for Him; I will surely defend my ways before Him. 
JOB.13.16	This, too, will be my salvation for no godless can come before Him. 
JOB.13.17	“Listen carefully to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears. 
JOB.13.18	See now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated. 
JOB.13.19	Who will contend with me? If so, I will be silent and die. 
JOB.13.20	“Only two things do not do to me; then I will not hide from Your face: 
JOB.13.21	withdraw Your hand far from me, and do not assail me with Your terror. 
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and You respond to me. 
JOB.13.23	How many are my iniquities and sins? Show me my transgressions and sin. 
JOB.13.24	Why do You hide Your face and consider me Your enemy? 
JOB.13.25	Will You frighten a windblown leaf and chase after dry chaff? 
JOB.13.26	For You write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 
JOB.13.27	You put my feet in shackles and watch all my paths; You put marks on the soles of my feet. 
JOB.13.28	“So he wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment. 
JOB.14.1	“A mortal born of woman, is of few days and full of turmoil. 
JOB.14.2	Like a flower he comes up and withers; like a shadow he flees and does not stay. 
JOB.14.3	Do You fix Your eyes on such a one, and bring me for judgment with You? 
JOB.14.4	Who can make something pure out of the impure? No one! 
JOB.14.5	Since his days are determined, the number of his months is with You, You have set his limits, which he cannot exceed. 
JOB.14.6	Look away from him and let him alone, until he fulfills his time like a hired laborer. 
JOB.14.7	“At least there is hope for a tree— if it is cut down it will sprout again, and its shoots will not cease. 
JOB.14.8	Though its roots grow old in the earth and its stump dies in the dry ground, 
JOB.14.9	at the scent of water it will bud and sprout sprigs like a new plant. 
JOB.14.10	But man dies and is powerless. Man expires—and where is he? 
JOB.14.11	As water evaporates from the sea and a river drains away and dries up, 
JOB.14.12	so a person lies down and does not rise; until the heavens are no more, people will not awake, or be roused from their sleep. 
JOB.14.13	“Oh that You would hide me in 
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard labor I will wait until my relief comes. 
JOB.14.15	You will call and I—I will answer You; You will long for the work of Your hands. 
JOB.14.16	For then You will number my steps; You will not keep track of my sin; 
JOB.14.17	my transgression will be sealed in a bundle and cover over my iniquity. 
JOB.14.18	“Yet as a mountain falls away and crumbles and a rock is moved from its place, 
JOB.14.19	as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so You destroy a person’s hope. 
JOB.14.20	You overpower him—once for all, and he perishes; You change his appearance and send him away. 
JOB.14.21	If his sons achieve honor, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not perceive it. 
JOB.14.22	He only feels pain for his own flesh, and mourns for his own soul.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded and said: 
JOB.15.2	“Does a wise man answer with empty knowledge, or fill his belly with the east wind? 
JOB.15.3	Does he argue with useless talk and words that have no value in them? 
JOB.15.4	You even do away with reverence and hinder devotion before God. 
JOB.15.5	For your iniquity prompts your mouth and you choose the tongue of the crafty. 
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you—not I; your own lips testify against you. 
JOB.15.7	“Are you the first man to be born? Were you brought forth before the hills? 
JOB.15.8	Do you listen in on God’s counsel? Do you limit wisdom to yourself? 
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we do not understand? 
JOB.15.10	Both gray-haired and aged are with us, men even older than your father. 
JOB.15.11	Are the comforts of God too small for you, or a gentle word toward you? 
JOB.15.12	Why has your heart carried you away and why do your eyes flash, 
JOB.15.13	so that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth? 
JOB.15.14	“What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous? 
JOB.15.15	If He puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes, 
JOB.15.16	how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks evil like water! 
JOB.15.17	I will tell you; listen to me, and what I have seen I will declare, 
JOB.15.18	what wise men have declared and did not hide from their ancestors, 
JOB.15.19	to whom alone the land was given, when no foreigner passed among them: 
JOB.15.20	All his days the wicked suffers torment, and numbered are the years stored up for the tyrant. 
JOB.15.21	Terrifying sounds are in his ears; in a time of peace, marauders attack him. 
JOB.15.22	He does not expect to escape from darkness; he is destined for the sword. 
JOB.15.23	He wanders about for bread— ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is at hand. 
JOB.15.24	Distress and anguish terrify him; they overpower him like a king poised to attack, 
JOB.15.25	for he raises his hand against God and flaunts himself against Shaddai, 
JOB.15.26	defiantly rushing at Him with a thick, strong shield. 
JOB.15.27	Because He covered his face with his fat and made his hips bulge with blubber, 
JOB.15.28	he lived in ruined cities, in houses which no one inhabits, which are ready to crumble into heaps. 
JOB.15.29	He will not become rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land. 
JOB.15.30	He will not escape from the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and he will depart by the breath of His mouth. 
JOB.15.31	“Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness will be his reward. 
JOB.15.32	Before his day it will be paid in full and his branch will not be green. 
JOB.15.33	He will shake off his unripe grapes like a vine, and cast off his blossoms like an olive tree. 
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery. 
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief and bring forth evil and their belly prepares deception.”
JOB.16.1	Job answered, saying: 
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many things like these; you are miserable comforters, all of you! 
JOB.16.3	Is there no end to your futile words? What compels you to answer? 
JOB.16.4	I too could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could compose words against you and shake my head at you. 
JOB.16.5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth and comfort from my lips would bring you relief. 
JOB.16.6	“Yet, if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I refrain, does it not go away from me? 
JOB.16.7	Surely now He has exhausted me; You have devastated my entire household. 
JOB.16.8	You have seized me— it has become a witness; my leanness rises against me and testifies to my face. 
JOB.16.9	His anger has torn and tormented me; He gnashes at me with his teeth; my enemy looks at me with daggers in his eyes. 
JOB.16.10	People open their mouths against me; they strike my cheek in contempt; they unite together against me. 
JOB.16.11	God has handed me over to the ungodly, and tossed me into the hands of the wicked. 
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but He shattered me; He grabbed me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me His target; 
JOB.16.13	His archers surround me. Without mercy He pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground. 
JOB.16.14	He breaks through against me, breach after breach. He runs after me like a warrior. 
JOB.16.15	“I have sewn sackcloth over my skin and sunk my horn in the dust; 
JOB.16.16	my face is red from weeping, and on my eyelids are deep darkness; 
JOB.16.17	yet no violence is in my hands and my prayer is pure. 
JOB.16.18	“Earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry find no resting place! 
JOB.16.19	Even now my witness is in heaven, my advocate is on high. 
JOB.16.20	My intercessor is my friend; as my eyes pour out tears to God; 
JOB.16.21	he contends with God on behalf of man as one pleads for a friend. 
JOB.16.22	“For the number of years will come to pass, and then I will go the way of no return. 
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is broken, my days have cut short, the graveyard awaits me. 
JOB.17.2	Surely mockers are with me, my eyes must gaze on their hostility. 
JOB.17.3	“Make then a pledge for me with You. Who else would strike hands with me? 
JOB.17.4	Because You have closed their heart to understanding, therefore You will not exalt them. 
JOB.17.5	If anyone denounces his friends for profit the eyes of his children will fail. 
JOB.17.6	He has made me a byword to people, I am the one in whose face people spit. 
JOB.17.7	My eyes have grown dim with grief and all my limbs are like a shadow. 
JOB.17.8	The upright are appalled at this; the innocent are stirred up against the ungodly. 
JOB.17.9	But the righteous one holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger. 
JOB.17.10	“But turn, all of you, come now! I will not find a wise man among you. 
JOB.17.11	My days have passed, my plans are torn apart. Yet the desires of my heart 
JOB.17.12	 turn night into day; in the face of darkness light is near. 
JOB.17.13	If I hope for 
JOB.17.14	if I say to the pit, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’ 
JOB.17.15	where then is my hope? And my hope, who sees it? 
JOB.17.16	Will it go down to the gates of 
JOB.18.1	Then, Bildad the Shuhite replied, saying: 
JOB.18.2	“How long until you end these words? Consider, and then we will talk. 
JOB.18.3	Why are we regarded as beasts, and stupid in your eyes? 
JOB.18.4	You, who tear yourself to pieces in anger, will the earth be abandoned for your sake? Or must a rock be moved from its place? 
JOB.18.5	Indeed, the light of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire does not shine. 
JOB.18.6	The light in his tent grows dark; the lamp above him goes out. 
JOB.18.7	His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own scheme throws him down. 
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his feet; he wanders into its mesh. 
JOB.18.9	A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast. 
JOB.18.10	A rope is hidden for him on the ground, and a trap for him lies on the path. 
JOB.18.11	On every side terrors frighten him and harass his every step. 
JOB.18.12	Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for his fall. 
JOB.18.13	It eats away pieces of his skin; death’s firstborn devours his limbs. 
JOB.18.14	He is torn from the security of his tent, and marched off to the king of terrors. 
JOB.18.15	Nothing of his dwells in his tent; brimstone is scattered over his dwelling. 
JOB.18.16	Below his roots dry up, and above his branches wither. 
JOB.18.17	His memory perishes from the earth and he has no name in the land. 
JOB.18.18	He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world. 
JOB.18.19	He has no offspring or descendant among his people, no survivor where he once dwelt. 
JOB.18.20	People of the west are appalled at his fate; people of the east are seized with horror. 
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked; such is the place of one who does not know God.” 
JOB.19.1	Job responded, saying: 
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment my soul and crush me with words? 
JOB.19.3	Ten times now you have reproached me; you attack me shamelessly. 
JOB.19.4	But even if it is true that I have erred, my error remains with me. 
JOB.19.5	If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and prove my humiliation against me, 
JOB.19.6	then know that God has wronged me and encircled me with His net. 
JOB.19.7	“Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response. I cry for help, but there is no justice. 
JOB.19.8	He has blocked my way so I cannot pass, and has shrouded my path in darkness. 
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my honor, and removed the crown from my head. 
JOB.19.10	He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree. 
JOB.19.11	His anger burns against me, and He considers me among His enemies. 
JOB.19.12	His troops advance together; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. 
JOB.19.13	“He removed my brothers far from me; my acquaintances are only strangers to me. 
JOB.19.14	My relatives have gone away and my close friends have forgotten me. 
JOB.19.15	My houseguests and my maidservants consider me a stranger. I have become a foreigner in their eyes. 
JOB.19.16	I call my servant but he does not reply though I beg him with my own mouth. 
JOB.19.17	My breath is repulsive to my wife; I am loathsome to my children. 
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me; when I stand, they speak against me. 
JOB.19.19	All my close friends despise me; those I love have turned against me. 
JOB.19.20	My bones cling to my skin and my flesh; I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth. 
JOB.19.21	“Have pity on me my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me. 
JOB.19.22	Why do you pursue me—like God? Are you not satisfied with my flesh? 
JOB.19.23	Oh that my words were written, that they were recorded in a scroll 
JOB.19.24	that with an iron pen and lead, they were engraved in stone forever! 
JOB.19.25	“Yet I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end, He will stand on earth. 
JOB.19.26	Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; 
JOB.19.27	I myself will see Him with my own eyes, I and not a stranger. My heart grows weak within me. 
JOB.19.28	“If you say, ‘How we will pursue him, since the root of the matter is found in him;’ 
JOB.19.29	then you should fear the sword for yourselves; for wrath brings the punishments of the sword— so that you may know judgment!”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite responded and said: 
JOB.20.2	“In truth, my troubled thoughts urge me to answer because of my feelings within me. 
JOB.20.3	I hear a rebuke that dishonors me and my understanding inspires me to reply. 
JOB.20.4	Do you not know that it has been from old, since mankind was put on earth, 
JOB.20.5	that the triumph of the wicked is short and the joy of the godless is but for a moment? 
JOB.20.6	Though his pride reaches to the heavens, and his head touches the clouds, 
JOB.20.7	he perishes forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’ 
JOB.20.8	Like a dream, he flies away and they cannot find him; like a vision of the night, he is chased away. 
JOB.20.9	The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more. 
JOB.20.10	His children must recompense the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth. 
JOB.20.11	His bones were full of his youthful vigor but it will lie down with him in the dust. 
JOB.20.12	Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue, 
JOB.20.13	though he cannot bear to let it go and holds it in his mouth, 
JOB.20.14	his food turns sour in his stomach; it becomes the venom of serpents within him. 
JOB.20.15	He swallows riches and vomits them up; God empties it out of his stomach. 
JOB.20.16	He sucks the poison of serpents; fangs of a viper kill him. 
JOB.20.17	He will not look at streams, rivers flowing with honey and butter. 
JOB.20.18	He gives back what he toiled for without swallowing it; he will not enjoy the riches of his trade. 
JOB.20.19	For he has oppressed and abandoned the poor. He has seized a house he did not build. 
JOB.20.20	For he knows no satisfaction from his greed, he cannot save himself by his desires. 
JOB.20.21	Nothing remains for him to devour; therefore his prosperity will not last. 
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him. 
JOB.20.23	While he is filling his belly, He will send the anger of His wrath against him, and rain it down it on him, on his flesh. 
JOB.20.24	Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze bow pierces him through. 
JOB.20.25	He pulls and it comes out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors come upon him! 
JOB.20.26	Total darkness waits for his treasures; A fire not fanned will devour him; it will consume what is left in his tent. 
JOB.20.27	The heavens will expose his iniquity; the earth will rise up against him. 
JOB.20.28	A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of His wrath. 
JOB.20.29	Such is the wicked man’s lot from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job replied: 
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation. 
JOB.21.3	Bear with me as I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on. 
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint against man? If so, why should I not be impatient? 
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth. 
JOB.21.6	When I think of it, I am terrified and my flesh shudders. 
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked go on living, growing old and increasing in power? 
JOB.21.8	Their children are established in their presence, their offspring before their eyes. 
JOB.21.9	Their homes have peace and are free from fear; no rod of God is on them. 
JOB.21.10	His bull breeds without fail; his cow calves and do not miscarry. 
JOB.21.11	They send out their little ones like a flock and their children dance. 
JOB.21.12	They sing to the tambourine and harp and rejoice at the sound of the flute. 
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment go down to 
JOB.21.14	Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone! We have no desire to know Your ways. 
JOB.21.15	Who is 
JOB.21.16	Look, their prosperity is not in their own hands; the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
JOB.21.17	“How often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out or calamity fallen on them? How often does He allot pain in His anger? 
JOB.21.18	How often are they like straw before the wind; like chaff swept away by a storm? 
JOB.21.19	You say, ‘God stores up the punishment for his children.’ Let Him repay the wicked so he may know it! 
JOB.21.20	Let his own eyes see his ruin; let him drink the wrath of Shaddai. 
JOB.21.21	For what does he care for his family that he leaves behind, when the number of his months has come to an end? 
JOB.21.22	“Can anyone teach God knowledge, since He judges even the highest. 
JOB.21.23	One dies in his full strength, completely secure and at ease. 
JOB.21.24	His pails are full of milk; His bones are moist with marrow. 
JOB.21.25	Yet another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted goodness. 
JOB.21.26	Together they lie in the dust and worms cover over them. 
JOB.21.27	“Behold, I know your thoughts, the schemes by which you wrong me. 
JOB.21.28	For you ask, ‘Where is the nobleman’s house and the tent where the wicked lived?’ 
JOB.21.29	Have you not asked travelers? Do you not recognize their accounts 
JOB.21.30	that the wicked are spared for the day of calamity that they are brought to the day of wrath? 
JOB.21.31	Who declares his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done? 
JOB.21.32	He is brought to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb. 
JOB.21.33	The soil in the valley is sweet to him; everyone follows after him, and countless are those before him. 
JOB.21.34	“So how will your futility comfort me, for your answers remain nothing but falsehood?” 
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded saying: 
JOB.22.2	“Can a man be useful to God? Can even a wise man benefit Him? 
JOB.22.3	What pleasure is it to 
JOB.22.4	Is it because of your reverence that He corrects you and He brings judgment against you? 
JOB.22.5	Is not your wickedness great, and is there no end to your iniquity? 
JOB.22.6	For you took pledges from your brothers for no reason; you stripped the naked of their clothing. 
JOB.22.7	You gave the weary no water to drink and from the hungry you withhold bread, 
JOB.22.8	Though you were a mighty man, owning land— an honored man living on it. 
JOB.22.9	You sent widows away empty-handed and crushed the arms of orphans. 
JOB.22.10	“That is why snares surround you, and why sudden fear terrifies you, 
JOB.22.11	or why it is so dark that you cannot see. and why a flood of water covers you. 
JOB.22.12	“Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see the lofty stars how high they are? 
JOB.22.13	Yet you say, ‘What does God know? Does He judge through such thick darkness? 
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see, as He walks in the vault of heaven.’ 
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod? 
JOB.22.16	They were snatched away before their time, their foundations washed away by a river. 
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Leave us alone! What can 
JOB.22.18	Yet He filled their houses with good things— but the counsel of the wicked is far from me! 
JOB.22.19	The righteous see and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying, 
JOB.22.20	‘Surely our foes are cut off, and fire consumes their abundance.’ 
JOB.22.21	“Reconcile now with Him and have 
JOB.22.22	Accept instruction from His mouth and store up His words in your heart. 
JOB.22.23	If you return to Shaddai, you will be restored; if you remove iniquity far from your tent 
JOB.22.24	and throw your gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir to the rocks in the wadis, 
JOB.22.25	then 
JOB.22.26	Surely then 
JOB.22.27	You will pray to Him and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows. 
JOB.22.28	What you decide will be done, and light will shine on your ways. 
JOB.22.29	When people are brought low, and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then He will save the downcast. 
JOB.22.30	He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered by the cleanness of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered: 
JOB.23.2	“Even today my complaint is rebellious; His hand is heavy despite my groaning. 
JOB.23.3	If only I knew where to find Him; if only I could go to His dwelling. 
JOB.23.4	I would lay out my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments. 
JOB.23.5	I would know with what words He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me. 
JOB.23.6	Would He oppose me with great power? No, He would only pay attention to me. 
JOB.23.7	There the upright can reason with Him, and there I would forever be delivered from my Judge. 
JOB.23.8	But, if I go to the east, He is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find Him. 
JOB.23.9	When He is in the north, I cannot perceive Him; When He turns south, I do not see Him. 
JOB.23.10	Yet He knows the way that I take; if He tested me, I would come out as gold. 
JOB.23.11	My foot has held closely to His steps; I have kept to His way and have not strayed. 
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the commands of His lips. I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread. 
JOB.23.13	He is unchangeable, and who can change Him? Whatever His soul desires, He does. 
JOB.23.14	For He fulfills the decree against me, and many such things are with Him. 
JOB.23.15	That is why I am terrified at His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him. 
JOB.23.16	God has made my heart faint; 
JOB.23.17	Yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor by the thick darkness that covers my face.”
JOB.24.1	“Why are times not stored up by Shaddai? And why do those who know Him not see His days? 
JOB.24.2	Some remove the boundary-stones; they steal flocks and pasture them. 
JOB.24.3	They drive away the orphan’s donkey and take the widow’s ox as a pledge. 
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy off the path; they force the poor of the land into hiding. 
JOB.24.5	Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert, they go about their work, foraging prey in the desert as food for their children. 
JOB.24.6	They reap their fodder in the field and glean in the vineyard of the wicked. 
JOB.24.7	Without clothing they spend the night naked, without covering against the cold. 
JOB.24.8	They are drenched by mountain rains, and hug the rock for lack of shelter. 
JOB.24.9	The orphan is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is taken as a pledge. 
JOB.24.10	They wander about naked, without clothing and go hungry while they carry sheaves. 
JOB.24.11	They press oil between the terraces; they tread winepresses, but are thirsty. 
JOB.24.12	From the city men groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out; yet God charges no one with folly. 
JOB.24.13	These are those who rebel against the light, who do not recognize its ways or stay in its paths. 
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises with the light, kills the poor and needy, and in the night becomes a thief. 
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer waits for twilight, thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ and he disguises his face. 
JOB.24.16	When it is dark, they break into houses, but by day, they shut themselves in; they do not know the light. 
JOB.24.17	For to all of them, morning is as thick darkness; they are familiar with the terrors of thick darkness. 
JOB.24.18	“He is foam on the surface of water; their portion of the land is cursed; no one turns toward their vineyards. 
JOB.24.19	As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so 
JOB.24.20	The womb forgets him, the worm feasts on him, no longer will he be remembered. But like a tree, wickedness is broken. 
JOB.24.21	He feeds on the barren and childless woman, and shows no kindness to the widow. 
JOB.24.22	But He drags off the mighty by His power; He raises up, yet no one has assurance of life. 
JOB.24.23	He allows him to rest in a sense of security, but His eyes are on their ways. 
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a little while and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others, they are like heads of grain they wither. 
JOB.24.25	Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar, and reduce my speech to nothing?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered: 
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and awe are with Him; He establishes 
JOB.25.3	Can His armies be counted? On whom does His light not rise? 
JOB.25.4	How then can a man be righteous with God? How can one born of a woman be pure? 
JOB.25.5	If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in His eyes, 
JOB.25.6	how much less man who is but a maggot— a son of man who is a worm!”
JOB.26.1	Then Job responded and said: 
JOB.26.2	“How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm without strength! 
JOB.26.3	How you have counseled the one without wisdom and revealed your abundant insights! 
JOB.26.4	To whom have you uttered words? Whose spirit has come from your mouth? 
JOB.26.5	“The dead tremble— those beneath the water and all that live in them. 
JOB.26.6	 is naked before Him; Abaddon has no covering. 
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over the void; He suspends the earth over nothing. 
JOB.26.8	He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under them. 
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the full moon, spreading His clouds over it. 
JOB.26.10	He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters, for a boundary between light and dark. 
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble, astounded at His rebuke! 
JOB.26.12	By His power He churns up the sea; by His understanding He smashed Rahab. 
JOB.26.13	By His 
JOB.26.14	Indeed, these are but glimpses of His ways; how faint the whisper, we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His might?”
JOB.27.1	And Job took up his discourse again, saying: 
JOB.27.2	“As God lives, who has deprived me of justice, 
JOB.27.3	as long as my breath is still in me, the 
JOB.27.4	my lips will speak no injustice, nor will my tongue mutter deceit. 
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me to say that you are just; until I die, I will not set aside my integrity! 
JOB.27.6	I will maintain my righteousness, and not let it go; my conscience will not reproach me for any of my days. 
JOB.27.7	“May my enemy be like the wicked my enemy like the unrighteous. 
JOB.27.8	For what hope has the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes his soul? 
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him? 
JOB.27.10	Will he delight in Shaddai? Will he call upon God at all times? 
JOB.27.11	I will teach you about the hand of God; I will not conceal the ways of Shaddai. 
JOB.27.12	Look, you have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk? 
JOB.27.13	“This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the inheritance that ruthless men receive from Shaddai. 
JOB.27.14	If his children increase— it is for the sword. His offspring will never have enough to eat. 
JOB.27.15	Those who survive him will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep. 
JOB.27.16	Though he piles up silver like dust, and clothing like heaps of mortar, 
JOB.27.17	what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and the upright will divide the silver. 
JOB.27.18	The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut made for a watchman. 
JOB.27.19	“He lies down wealthy, but will gather no more. When he opens his eyes, all is gone! 
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a flood; a storm sweeps him away at night. 
JOB.27.21	The east wind picks him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. 
JOB.27.22	It hurls itself at him without pity as he flees headlong from its hand. 
JOB.27.23	It claps its hands at him in derision, and hisses him out of his place.”
JOB.28.1	“Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is refined. 
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore. 
JOB.28.3	Man puts an end to darkness; he searches to the farthest reaches for ore in gloom and blackest darkness. 
JOB.28.4	He cuts open a shaft far from dwellings, in places forgotten by feet. Far from other people, they dangle back and forth. 
JOB.28.5	The earth, from which food comes, is transformed as by fire; 
JOB.28.6	a place whose rocks are sapphires, its dust contains gold. 
JOB.28.7	No bird of prey knows the path; nor falcon’s eye has seen it. 
JOB.28.8	Proud beasts have not set foot on it, and no lion has passed there. 
JOB.28.9	Man sets his hand against the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots. 
JOB.28.10	He carves out tunnels through the rocks; his eye sees every precious thing. 
JOB.28.11	He dams up streams from flowing. And brings hidden things to light. 
JOB.28.12	“But where can wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding? 
JOB.28.13	No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living. 
JOB.28.14	The deep says, ‘It is not in me’— The sea says, ‘It’s not with me.’ 
JOB.28.15	Pure gold cannot be given for it, nor can its price be weighed in silver. 
JOB.28.16	It cannot be weighed in gold from Ophir, in precious onyx, or sapphire. 
JOB.28.17	Neither gold or crystal can compare with it, nor vessels of fine gold exchanged for it. 
JOB.28.18	No mention will be made of coral or jasper; the price of wisdom is more than pearls. 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare to it; nor can it be valued in pure gold. 
JOB.28.20	Where then does wisdom come from? Where is the place of understanding? 
JOB.28.21	It has been hidden from the eyes of all living things, concealed from the birds of the sky. 
JOB.28.22	Abaddon and Death say, ‘With our ears we have heard a rumor of it.’ 
JOB.28.23	“God understands its way and He knows its place. 
JOB.28.24	He looks to the ends of the earth, and sees everything under the heavens. 
JOB.28.25	When He made the force of the wind, and measured out the waters, 
JOB.28.26	when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm, 
JOB.28.27	then He looked at it and assessed it established it and examined it. 
JOB.28.28	And He said to mankind, ‘The fear of the Lord —that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.”’ 
JOB.29.1	Again Job took up his discourse saying: 
JOB.29.2	“O that I could be as in the months gone by, as in the days when God watched over me, 
JOB.29.3	when His lamp shone above my head, when by His light I walked through darkness; 
JOB.29.4	as I was in the days of my prime, when God’s intimate friendship was upon my tent, 
JOB.29.5	when 
JOB.29.6	when my steps were bathed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil. 
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the city gate, and secured my seat in the public square, 
JOB.29.8	young men would see me and hide, old men would rise and stand; 
JOB.29.9	princes refrained from talking and put their hand over their mouths; 
JOB.29.10	the voice of the nobles was hushed and their tongue stuck to their palate. 
JOB.29.11	“When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw me, it commended me; 
JOB.29.12	for I saved the poor who cried for help, and the orphan who had no one to help him; 
JOB.29.13	the blessing of the dying man came on me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy. 
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was as my robe and turban. 
JOB.29.15	I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame; 
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy, and I investigated the case of one I did not know. 
JOB.29.17	I broke the jaws of the unjust, and snatched the prey out of his teeth. 
JOB.29.18	“Then I thought, ‘I will die in my nest, and multiply my days like the sand. 
JOB.29.19	My roots reach the water, and dew lies on my branches all night. 
JOB.29.20	My glory is fresh within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’ 
JOB.29.21	“People listened to me and waited, and kept silent for my advice. 
JOB.29.22	After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell on them drop by drop. 
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as for the rain, and opened their mouths as for spring rain. 
JOB.29.24	When I joked with them, they hardly believed it; they did not cause the light of my face to fall. 
JOB.29.25	I chose their way and sat as their chief; I lived as a king among the troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.
JOB.30.1	“But now they mock me— those younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs. 
JOB.30.2	Moreover, what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor has gone from them. 
JOB.30.3	Haggard from want and hunger, they gnaw the parched land, in former time desolate and waste. 
JOB.30.4	In the brush they pluck salt herbs, and their food was from the root of the broom tree. 
JOB.30.5	They were banished from society, shouted at as if they were thieves, 
JOB.30.6	so they were forced to dwell in wadis, in holes of the earth and among the rocks. 
JOB.30.7	They brayed among the bushes and huddled under the nettles. 
JOB.30.8	A senseless and nameless brood, they were cast out from the land. 
JOB.30.9	“So now I have become their taunt song; I have become a byword to them. 
JOB.30.10	They despise me; they keep their distance from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. 
JOB.30.11	Because He has loosened my cord and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint in my presence 
JOB.30.12	On my right the rabble rise up; they entangle my feet and build up their destructive paths against me. 
JOB.30.13	They break up my path; they succeed in destroying me without anyone helping them. 
JOB.30.14	As through a wide breach they come; amid the ruins they come rolling in. 
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned on me; they chase away my honor like the wind, and like a cloud my deliverance vanishes. 
JOB.30.16	“And now my soul is poured out within me; days of suffering have taken hold of me. 
JOB.30.17	Night pierces my bones within me; my gnawing pains never rest. 
JOB.30.18	By great power He seizes my garment; He binds me like the collar of my tunic. 
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes. 
JOB.30.20	“I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, but You only look at me. 
JOB.30.21	You have turned on me cruelly; You attack me with the might of Your hand. 
JOB.30.22	You lift me up on the wind and make me ride on it; You toss me about in the storm. 
JOB.30.23	For I know that you will bring me to death, to the house appointed for all the living. 
JOB.30.24	Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out His hand, and in his distress cry for help? 
JOB.30.25	Have I not wept for the unfortunate? Was not my soul grieved for the poor? 
JOB.30.26	Yet, when I hoped for good, evil came; when I waited for light, then darkness came. 
JOB.30.27	“My heart seethes and never stops; days of suffering confront me. 
JOB.30.28	I walk about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand in the assembly and cry for help. 
JOB.30.29	I have become a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches. 
JOB.30.30	My skin has turned black on me; my bones burn with heat. 
JOB.30.31	My harp is for mourning and my flute for the sound of weeping. 
JOB.31.1	“I made a covenant with my eyes not to pay attention to a virgin. 
JOB.31.2	For what is one’s lot from God above, one’s heritage from 
JOB.31.3	Is it not calamity for the unjust, and disaster for workers of iniquity? 
JOB.31.4	Does He not see my ways and count all my steps? 
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried to deceit, 
JOB.31.6	then let Him weigh me with honest scales, then God will know my integrity. 
JOB.31.7	If my step has strayed from the way, if my heart has walked after my eyes, or if any defilement has stuck to my hands, 
JOB.31.8	then let me sow and another eat, and let my crops be uprooted. 
JOB.31.9	If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or I have lurked at my neighbor’s door, 
JOB.31.10	then let my wife grind for another and let others sleep with her. 
JOB.31.11	For that would be a shameful act, an iniquity to be judged. 
JOB.31.12	For it is a fire that devours to destruction, and uproots all my harvest. 
JOB.31.13	“If I have denied justice to my male or female servant when they disputed with me, 
JOB.31.14	then what could I do when God rises up; when He visits, how will I answer Him? 
JOB.31.15	Did not He who made me in the womb, make him? Did not the same one form us in the womb? 
JOB.31.16	“If I withheld the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow to fail, 
JOB.31.17	if I ate my morsel of bread myself, without letting an orphan eat of it 
JOB.31.18	(but from my youth I reared him as a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided her), 
JOB.31.19	if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing or the needy without a covering, 
JOB.31.20	if his heart did not bless me as he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep, 
JOB.31.21	if I have raised my hand against the orphan, when I saw my support in the gate, 
JOB.31.22	then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken off at the joint. 
JOB.31.23	For calamity from God was a terror to me, and because of His majesty, I could do nothing. 
JOB.31.24	“If I have put my confidence in gold or said to fine gold, ‘You are my security,’ 
JOB.31.25	if I rejoiced because of my great wealth or because of the abundance my hand acquired, 
JOB.31.26	if I looked at the sun when it shines or the moon moving in splendor, 
JOB.31.27	so that my heart was secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, 
JOB.31.28	then this also would be iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God above. 
JOB.31.29	“If I rejoiced at my enemy’s misfortune or gloated because calamity found him— 
JOB.31.30	I have not allowed my mouth to sin, by asking for his life with a curse— 
JOB.31.31	if anyone in my household has ever said, ‘Who has not been filled with his meat?’ 
JOB.31.32	—but no stranger had to spend the night outside for my door was open to the traveler— 
JOB.31.33	if I have I covered my transgressions like Adam, by hiding my guilt in my bosom 
JOB.31.34	because I feared a great multitude, and the contempt of clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside. 
JOB.31.35	O, that I had someone to hear me! Look, here is my signature, let 
JOB.31.36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown. 
JOB.31.37	I would give Him an account of my steps; like a prince I would approach Him. 
JOB.31.38	“If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together, 
JOB.31.39	if I have eaten its fruits without money, or caused the death of its owners, 
JOB.31.40	then let briars come up instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite of the clan of Ram became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. 
JOB.32.3	He was also angry with his three friends because they had not found an answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older. 
JOB.32.5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his anger was aroused. 
JOB.32.6	Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite responded and said: “I am young in days and you are old; that is why I was timid and dared not to tell what I know. 
JOB.32.7	I thought, ‘Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.’ 
JOB.32.8	But there is a spirit in people, the breath of 
JOB.32.9	It is not only the aged who are wise or old men who understand justice. 
JOB.32.10	“Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me! I, even I, will explain what I know.’ 
JOB.32.11	Look, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words 
JOB.32.12	I gave you my full attention. But behold, no one proved Job wrong; none among you, answered his statements. 
JOB.32.13	Lest you should say, ‘We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man!’ 
JOB.32.14	Job has not directed his words to me and I will not respond to him with your arguments. 
JOB.32.15	“They are dismayed and no longer reply; words have failed them. 
JOB.32.16	Must I wait, since they no longer speak since they stand there with no reply? 
JOB.32.17	I too will answer my part; I too will declare what I know. 
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me; 
JOB.32.19	inside I am like wine that has no opening, like new wineskins ready to burst. 
JOB.32.20	I must speak that I may find relief; I will open my lips that I may answer. 
JOB.32.21	I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter anyone; 
JOB.32.22	for I do not know how to flatter else my Maker would quickly carry me away!
JOB.33.1	“But now, Job, listen to my words and give ear to everything I say. 
JOB.33.2	See now, I open my mouth; my tongue in my mouth speaks. 
JOB.33.3	My words are from my upright heart; my lips speak sincerely what they know. 
JOB.33.4	“The 
JOB.33.5	Answer me, if you can; array yourselves before me; take your stand! 
JOB.33.6	Look, I am the same as you before God; I too am formed from clay. 
JOB.33.7	See, no fear of me should terrify you, nor should my pressure be heavy on you. 
JOB.33.8	“Indeed, you have said in my hearing, —I heard the sound of the words: 
JOB.33.9	‘I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, without iniquity. 
JOB.33.10	Yet, He has found fault with me; He considers me His enemy. 
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the shackles; He watches closely all my paths.’ 
JOB.33.12	“But in this, you are not right— I answer you, for God is greater than a mortal. 
JOB.33.13	Why do you contend against Him that He does not answer all His words. 
JOB.33.14	Indeed, God speaks once, even twice, yet no one perceives it. 
JOB.33.15	“In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, as they slumber in bed, 
JOB.33.16	Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction, 
JOB.33.17	in order to turn a man from his conduct and to cover a person’s pride. 
JOB.33.18	He spares his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword. 
JOB.33.19	Or a person is chastened with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones, 
JOB.33.20	so that his life loathes bread, and his soul, desirable food. 
JOB.33.21	His flesh wastes away from sight, and his bones, once unseen, now stick out. 
JOB.33.22	His soul draws near to the Pit and his life to the messengers of death. 
JOB.33.23	“If there is an angel beside him, a messenger, one out of a thousand, to declare to a man his uprightness, 
JOB.33.24	then He is gracious to him, and says ‘Deliver him from going down to the Pit— I have found a ransom;’ 
JOB.33.25	let his flesh be restored like a child’s; let him return to the days of his youth.’ 
JOB.33.26	He entreats God and is accepted by Him; he sees His face with a shout of joy; He restores to the man his righteousness. 
JOB.33.27	He sings to others, saying, ‘I have sinned and perverted what is right, but I did not get what I deserved. 
JOB.33.28	He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and my life sees the light.’ 
JOB.33.29	“Indeed, God does all these things, twice, even three times with a man, 
JOB.33.30	to bring his soul back from the Pit, that he may be illuminated with the light of life. 
JOB.33.31	Pay attention, Job, listen to me; Be silent, and I will speak. 
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I want to justify you. 
JOB.33.33	If not, then listen to me. Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu answered: 
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men; give ear to me, you men of learning. 
JOB.34.3	For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food. 
JOB.34.4	Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us learn together what is good. 
JOB.34.5	“For Job says, ‘I am righteous, but God has deprived me of justice. 
JOB.34.6	Concerning my right, should I lie? My wound is incurable, although I am without transgression.’ 
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job, who drinks mockery like water, 
JOB.34.8	who keeps company with evildoers, and walks with wicked men? 
JOB.34.9	For he says, ‘It does not profit a man when he makes his delight with God.’ 
JOB.34.10	“Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding: Wickedness is far from God, injustice from 
JOB.34.11	For He repays a person for what he has done, and brings on the person what he deserves. 
JOB.34.12	“Truly God does not act wickedly, and 
JOB.34.13	Who appointed Him over the earth? Who put Him over the whole world? 
JOB.34.14	“If He were to set His heart on it, and gather to Himself His 
JOB.34.15	all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to dust. 
JOB.34.16	“Now if you have understanding, hear this; give ear to the sound of my words. 
JOB.34.17	Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the mighty, righteous One? 
JOB.34.18	Who says to a king, ‘Worthless man’ and to nobles, ‘Wicked men’! 
JOB.34.19	Who shows no partiality before princes, and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of His hands. 
JOB.34.20	They die in a moment, at midnight, people are shaken and they pass away. The mighty are removed without a hand. 
JOB.34.21	“For His eyes are on the ways of man; He sees all his steps. 
JOB.34.22	There is no gloom and no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide themselves. 
JOB.34.23	For He does not consider a man further that he should go before God in judgment. 
JOB.34.24	He shatters the mighty without inquiry, and sets others in their place. 
JOB.34.25	Thus He recognizes their deeds, He overturns them in the night and they are crushed. 
JOB.34.26	He strikes them for their wickedness in a place where people can see, 
JOB.34.27	because they turned from following Him, and have not understood any of His ways. 
JOB.34.28	They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, so that He hears the cry of the afflicted. 
JOB.34.29	“But if He is quiet, who can condemn Him? If He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He is over a nation and an individual alike, 
JOB.34.30	so that godless men should not rule, nor lay snares for people. 
JOB.34.31	“Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have born chastisement, but I will not act wickedly any more. 
JOB.34.32	Teach me what I cannot see. If I have done evil, I will not do it again.’ 
JOB.34.33	Should He requite it on your terms, because you reject it? But you must choose and not I; now declare what you know. 
JOB.34.34	“Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me, 
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge, and his words lack understanding.’ 
JOB.34.36	Oh, that Job might be tested to the end, for answering like wicked men. 
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion to his sin; in our midst he claps his hands and multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu answered, saying: 
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is just? Do you say, ‘My righteousness is greater than God’s?’ 
JOB.35.3	For you ask, ‘What will it profit you?’ and ‘What do I gain by not sinning?’ 
JOB.35.4	I will answer you, and your friends with you. 
JOB.35.5	Look up at the heavens and see; consider the clouds so high above you. 
JOB.35.6	If you sin, how does it affect Him? If your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him? 
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand? 
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness is for a man like yourself, and your righteousness for a son of man. 
JOB.35.9	“Because of a multitude of oppressions, they cry out; they cry for help because of the power of the mighty. 
JOB.35.10	But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 
JOB.35.11	who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, who makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’ 
JOB.35.12	There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of the wicked. 
JOB.35.13	Indeed God does not hear an empty cry; 
JOB.35.14	How much less when you say that you do not perceive Him that the case is before Him and you must wait for Him. 
JOB.35.15	And further, that His anger does not punish and that He does not know transgression? 
JOB.35.16	So Job opens his mouth with nonsense, without knowledge he multiplies words.”
JOB.36.1	Then Elihu said further: 
JOB.36.2	“Be patient with me a bit longer and I will show you that there is more to say on God’s behalf. 
JOB.36.3	I get my knowledge from afar; I ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
JOB.36.4	For truly, my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 
JOB.36.5	“Indeed, God is mighty, but despises none, He is mighty in strength of understanding. 
JOB.36.6	He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives justice to the afflicted. 
JOB.36.7	He does not take His eyes from the righteous, but enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever. 
JOB.36.8	But if they are bound in chains, and held captive by cords of affliction, 
JOB.36.9	then He declares to them their deed that they have transgressed arrogantly. 
JOB.36.10	And He opens their ear to instruction, and commands that they turn from evil. 
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve, they will end their days in prosperity, and their years in happiness. 
JOB.36.12	But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword, and die without knowledge. 
JOB.36.13	“The godless in heart harbor anger, they do not cry for help even when He binds them. 
JOB.36.14	Their souls die in youth, their life ends among cult prostitutes. 
JOB.36.15	He delivers the afflicted by his affliction and opens their ear in oppression. 
JOB.36.16	“And indeed, He will draw you from the mouth of distress, to a spacious place without constraint, and the comfort of a table full of rich food. 
JOB.36.17	But you are full of judgment on the wicked, judgment and justice take hold of you! 
JOB.36.18	Beware lest wrath entice you with riches; or a large bribe turn you aside. 
JOB.36.19	Will your wealth sustain you to keep you from distress, or even all your mighty efforts? 
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their places. 
JOB.36.21	Be careful, do not turn to iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction. 
JOB.36.22	“Indeed, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him? 
JOB.36.23	Who has prescribed His way for Him? Or said ‘You have done wrong’? 
JOB.36.24	Remember to magnify His work, of which people have sung. 
JOB.36.25	All mankind has seen it; people gaze on it from afar. 
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is exalted —beyond our knowledge! The number of His years is unsearchable. 
JOB.36.27	For He draws up the drops of water; they distill rain into its mist, 
JOB.36.28	which the clouds pour down and shower mankind abundantly. 
JOB.36.29	Indeed, who can understand the spreading of the clouds, and the thunder from His pavilion? 
JOB.36.30	“See how He scatters His lightning about Him, covering the depths of the sea. 
JOB.36.31	For by these, He judges peoples and supplies food in abundance. 
JOB.36.32	He covers His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its target. 
JOB.36.33	His thunder declares His presence, the cattle also, about what is coming.
JOB.37.1	“At this my heart trembles and leaps from its place. 
JOB.37.2	Listen carefully to the roar of His voice, the rumbling that comes from His mouth. 
JOB.37.3	Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, and His light to the ends of the earth. 
JOB.37.4	After that a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not hold them back when His voice is heard. 
JOB.37.5	God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things beyond our comprehension. 
JOB.37.6	“For to the snow He says, ‘Fall to the earth,’ and to the torrential rain— be a mighty downpour of rain. 
JOB.37.7	He seals the hand of every man, so that all men will know His work. 
JOB.37.8	The animals go into their lairs; they remain in their dens. 
JOB.37.9	Out of its chamber comes the storm, and icy cold from the driving wind. 
JOB.37.10	From the breath of God frost is made, and the watery expanse freezes. 
JOB.37.11	He loads the cloud with moisture; He scatters His cloud of lightning. 
JOB.37.12	It swirls around by His guidance, to do whatever He commands on the face of the inhabited world. 
JOB.37.13	Whether it is a rod of punishment or for His land or for lovingkindness, He causes it to happen. 
JOB.37.14	“Listen to this, Job: stand and consider God’s wonders. 
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God orders them, and makes the lightning flash in His cloud? 
JOB.37.16	Do you know the balancing of clouds, the wonders of Him who has perfect knowledge? 
JOB.37.17	“You, whose clothes are hot, when the earth is still, because of the south wind, 
JOB.37.18	can you, with Him, stretch out the skies, strong as a mirror of molten metal? 
JOB.37.19	Teach us what to say to Him; we cannot prepare a case because of the darkness. 
JOB.37.20	Should He be informed that I want to speak? If a man speaks, would he be swallowed up? 
JOB.37.21	But now, they do not see the light, bright as it is in the skies, until the wind has passed and cleared the clouds away. 
JOB.37.22	Out of the north comes in golden splendor; around God is awesome majesty. 
JOB.37.23	Shaddai, we cannot find Him! He is great in power and justice, and abundant righteousness He does not oppress. 
JOB.37.24	Therefore people fear Him; He does not regard all the wise of heart.”
JOB.38.1	Then 
JOB.38.2	“Who is this, who darkens counsel with words without knowledge? 
JOB.38.3	Now gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you will inform Me! 
JOB.38.4	“Where were you when I laid the foundations of earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding. 
JOB.38.5	Who set its dimensions —if you know— or who stretched a line over it? 
JOB.38.6	On what were its foundations set, or who laid its cornerstone— 
JOB.38.7	when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 
JOB.38.8	“And who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, 
JOB.38.9	when I made a cloud its garment and thick darkness its swaddling cloth, 
JOB.38.10	when I prescribed my boundary for it, and set bars and gates, 
JOB.38.11	when I said, ‘This far you may come, but no further; here your majestic waves will stop.’ 
JOB.38.12	“Have you ever in your life commanded the morning, or caused dawn to know its place; 
JOB.38.13	that it would take hold of the corners of the earth and shake the wicked out of it? 
JOB.38.14	It changes shape like clay under a seal— they stand out like those of a garment. 
JOB.38.15	And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the upraised arm is broken. 
JOB.38.16	“Have you gone to the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep? 
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness? 
JOB.38.18	Have you comprehended the expanses of the earth? If you know it all, declare it! 
JOB.38.19	In what direction does light dwell, and darkness, where is its place— 
JOB.38.20	that you can take it to its borders, and discern the paths to its home? 
JOB.38.21	Surely you know, for you were born then; and the number of your days is great! 
JOB.38.22	“Have you entered the storehouses of snow or seen the storehouses of hail, 
JOB.38.23	which I reserved for a time of distress, for a day of battle and war? 
JOB.38.24	In what direction is light distributed, or the east wind scattered over the earth? 
JOB.38.25	Who cuts a channel for the flood, and a path for the thunderstorm, 
JOB.38.26	to cause it to rain on an uninhabited land, a desert with no one in it, 
JOB.38.27	to satisfy a devastated and desolate land, and cause it to sprout grass? 
JOB.38.28	Does the rain have a father, or who has birthed the drops of dew? 
JOB.38.29	From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost of heaven, 
JOB.38.30	when the waters hide like stone, and the surface of the deep is frozen? 
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the chains of Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion? 
JOB.38.32	Do you bring out the constellations in their season or guide the Bear with her cubs? 
JOB.38.33	Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you set up dominion over the earth? 
JOB.38.34	“Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with an abundance of water? 
JOB.38.35	Can you send out lightning bolts, so they go? Will they say to you, ‘Here we are’? 
JOB.38.36	Who put wisdom in the secret place or gave understanding to the mind? 
JOB.38.37	Who can count the clouds by wisdom, or tip over the water jars of heaven, 
JOB.38.38	when dust hardens into a mass and clods of earth stick together? 
JOB.38.39	“Do you hunt prey for the lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions, 
JOB.38.40	when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in the thicket? 
JOB.38.41	Who arranges provision for the raven, when its young cry out to God, and wander about for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving doe? 
JOB.39.2	Do you count the months they fulfill and do you know the time when they give birth 
JOB.39.3	when they kneel, bring forth their young, and their labor pains end? 
JOB.39.4	Their young thrive and grow strong in the open field; They leave and never return to them. 
JOB.39.5	“Who sent the wild donkey free? Who released the bonds of the wild ass, 
JOB.39.6	to whom I gave the Arabah as its home, the salt land as its dwelling place? 
JOB.39.7	It scorns the commotion in the town; it does not hear the taskmaster’s shouts. 
JOB.39.8	It explores the mountains as its pasture and searches after every green thing. 
JOB.39.9	“Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will it spend the night at your manger? 
JOB.39.10	Will you bind a wild ox to a furrow with his rope? Will it plow valleys behind you? 
JOB.39.11	Will you rely on it for its great strength? Will you leave your labor to it? 
JOB.39.12	Can you trust it to bring in your seed and gather it to your threshing floor? 
JOB.39.13	“The wings of the ostrich flap joyously, but are they the pinions and plumage of a stork? 
JOB.39.14	For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the soil, 
JOB.39.15	and forgets that a foot may crush them, that a wild beast may trample them. 
JOB.39.16	She treats her young ones harshly, as if they were not hers; She is not concerned that her labor was in vain, 
JOB.39.17	for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of understanding. 
JOB.39.18	When she lifts herself to flee she laughs at the horse and its rider. 
JOB.39.19	“Do you give the horse its strength? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? 
JOB.39.20	Do you cause him to leap like locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying! 
JOB.39.21	He paws in the valley and exalting in his strength he charges into the fray. 
JOB.39.22	He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not recoil from the sword. 
JOB.39.23	On him the quiver rattles; the spear and javelin flash. 
JOB.39.24	With quaking and excitement, he swallows up the ground. He cannot stand still when the 
JOB.39.25	At the blast of the 
JOB.39.26	“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, spreading its wings toward the south? 
JOB.39.27	Is it by your command that an eagle soars and builds its nest high? 
JOB.39.28	It dwells on a cliff and spends the night there, on a rocky crag and stronghold. 
JOB.39.29	From there it searches for food; its eyes detect it from afar. 
JOB.39.30	Its young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there it is.”
JOB.40.1	Then 
JOB.40.2	“Will the one who contends with 
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered 
JOB.40.4	“Indeed, I am unworthy— what can I reply to You? I put my hand over my mouth. 
JOB.40.5	I spoke once, but I have no answer— twice, but I will say no more.” 
JOB.40.6	Then 
JOB.40.7	“Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you will inform Me! 
JOB.40.8	“Would you really annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me to justify yourself? 
JOB.40.9	Do you have an arm like God’s and can you thunder with a voice like His? 
JOB.40.10	Then adorn yourself in majesty and dignity; clothe yourself in splendor and honor. 
JOB.40.11	Scatter the fury of your anger. Look at every proud person and bring him low; 
JOB.40.12	look at everyone who is proud and humble him; tread down the wicked where they stand. 
JOB.40.13	Hide them together in the dust bind their faces in the hidden place. 
JOB.40.14	Then I—even I will acknowledge to you, that your own right hand can save you!
JOB.40.15	“Look now at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He eats grass like an ox. 
JOB.40.16	Now look at his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. 
JOB.40.17	He stiffens his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 
JOB.40.18	His bones are tubes of bronze; His limbs like rods of iron. 
JOB.40.19	He is first among the ways of God, Let his Maker draw near with His sword! 
JOB.40.20	For the mountains bring him food, and all the wild animals play there. 
JOB.40.21	Under the lotus plants he lies down, in the secrecy of the reeds and marsh. 
JOB.40.22	The lotuses conceal him in their shade; the willows of the brook surround him. 
JOB.40.23	If the river rages, he is not alarmed. He is secure, even though the Jordan surges against his mouth. 
JOB.40.24	Can anyone capture it by its eyes, or pierce his nose with hooks? 
JOB.40.25	“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook, or tie down his tongue with a cord? 
JOB.40.26	Can you put a reed rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 
JOB.40.27	Will he make many supplications to you, or speak softly to you? 
JOB.40.28	Will he make a covenant with you, so you can take him as a slave forever? 
JOB.40.29	Can you play with him like a bird, or put him on a leash for your girls? 
JOB.40.30	Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him among the merchants? 
JOB.40.31	Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 
JOB.40.32	If you lay your hands on him— you will remember the battle and never do it again! 
JOB.41.1	“See, his hope is wrong, he is laid low, even the sight of him. 
JOB.41.2	Is he not fierce when he is roused? Who then is able to stand before Me? 
JOB.41.3	Who has confronted Me that I should repay? Everything under heaven belongs to Me. 
JOB.41.4	“I will not keep silent about his limbs, or his might or the grace of his arrangement. 
JOB.41.5	Who can strip off his outer garment? Who can penetrate his double armor? 
JOB.41.6	Who can open the doors of his face, ringed with fearsome teeth? 
JOB.41.7	His rows of shields are his pride, shut up closely as with tight seal; 
JOB.41.8	each so close to the next, that no air can pass between. 
JOB.41.9	They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated. 
JOB.41.10	“He sneezes out flashes of light; his eyes are like the eyelids of dawn. 
JOB.41.11	Out of his mouth go flames, sparks of fire shoot out. 
JOB.41.12	Smoke pours from his nostrils, as a boiling pot over burning reeds. 
JOB.41.13	His breath sets coals ablaze and flames dart from his mouth. 
JOB.41.14	“Strength resides in his neck; dismay runs before him. 
JOB.41.15	The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm on him, immovable. 
JOB.41.16	His heart is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. 
JOB.41.17	“When he rises up, the mighty are afraid; at his crashing they retreat. 
JOB.41.18	A sword that reaches him has no effect— nor with a spear, dart, or javelin. 
JOB.41.19	He regards iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood. 
JOB.41.20	Arrows do not make him flee; sling stones become like chaff to him. 
JOB.41.21	A club is regarded as stubble; he laughs at the rattling 0f a lance. 
JOB.41.22	“His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail like a threshing sledge in mud. 
JOB.41.23	He makes the deep boil like a cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. 
JOB.41.24	He leaves a shining wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair. 
JOB.41.25	Nothing on dry land is his equal— a creature without fear. 
JOB.41.26	He sees every haughty thing; he is king over all who are proud.”
JOB.42.1	Job answered 
JOB.42.2	“I know You can do all things; no purpose of Yours can be thwarted. 
JOB.42.3	You ask, ‘Who is this, who darkens counsel without knowledge?’ Surely I spoke without understanding, things too wonderful for me which I did not know. 
JOB.42.4	You said, ‘Hear now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you will inform Me.’ 
JOB.42.5	I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye has seen You. 
JOB.42.6	Therefore I despise myself, and repent on dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	After 
JOB.42.8	So now, take for yourselves seven young bulls and seven rams and go to My servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept Job’s prayer and not deal with you according to your folly because you have not spoken correctly about Me, like My servant Job.” 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what 
JOB.42.10	So 
JOB.42.11	Then all his brothers, all his sisters and everyone who had known him before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They consoled him and comforted him for all the calamity that 
JOB.42.12	So 
JOB.42.13	He also had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 
JOB.42.15	Nowhere in the land were there found women as beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers. 
JOB.42.16	After this, Job lived 140 years; he saw his children and their children for four generations. 
JOB.42.17	And so Job died, old and full of days.
SNG.1.1	The song of songs of Solomon 
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. 
SNG.1.3	Your ointments have a pleasing fragrance. Your name is poured out like perfume. No wonder maidens love you! 
SNG.1.4	Draw me after you, let us run! The king has brought me into his chambers. Let us rejoice and be glad in you; let us extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you! 
SNG.1.5	I am black, but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 
SNG.1.6	Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked on me. My mother’s sons were angry with me and made me keeper of the vineyards; my very own vineyard I have not kept. 
SNG.1.7	Tell me, the one my soul loves, where you graze your flock, where you make it lie down at noon? Why should I be as one veiled beside the flocks of your companions? 
SNG.1.8	If you yourself do not know, O most beautiful among women, go out yourself in the footsteps of the flock and graze your kids by the shepherds’ tents. 
SNG.1.9	I compare you, my darling, to my mare among Pharaoh’s chariots. 
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of beads. 
SNG.1.11	 Ornaments of gold we will make for you with spangles of silver. 
SNG.1.12	While the king is on his couch, my nard spreads its fragrance. 
SNG.1.13	My lover is my pouch of myrrh, passing the night between my breasts. 
SNG.1.14	My love is to me a spray of henna blooms in the vineyards of En-gedi. 
SNG.1.15	How lovely you are, my darling, how lovely! Your eyes are doves. 
SNG.1.16	How handsome you are, my lover! Oh, so delightful! Yes, our couch is luxuriant. 
SNG.1.17	The beams of our houses are cedar trees, our panels are cypress trees.
SNG.2.1	I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among thorns, so is my darling among the daughters. 
SNG.2.3	Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my lover among the sons. In his shadow I delighted to sit, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 
SNG.2.4	He has brought me to the banquet house and his banner over me is love. 
SNG.2.5	Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples— for I am weak with love. 
SNG.2.6	His left hand is under my head and his right hand embraces me. 
SNG.2.7	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you, by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it delights. 
SNG.2.8	The voice of my lover! Behold, he is coming— leaping over the mountains, springing over the hills! 
SNG.2.9	My lover is like a gazelle or a young buck among the stags. Look! He is standing behind our wall— gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice. 
SNG.2.10	In response my lover said to me: “Get yourself up, my darling, my pretty one, and come, come! 
SNG.2.11	For behold, the winter has past, the rain is over, it has gone. 
SNG.2.12	Blossoms appear in the land, the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land. 
SNG.2.13	The fig tree ripens its early figs. The blossoming vines give off their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling, my pretty one, and come, come! 
SNG.2.14	My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in a secret place along the steep path, let me see your form, let me hear your voice. For your voice is sweet and your form is lovely.” 
SNG.2.15	Catch the foxes for us— the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom.
SNG.2.16	My lover is mine, and I am his! He grazes his flocks among the lilies. 
SNG.2.17	Until the day cools and the shadows flee away, turn about, my lover, like a gazelle or like a stag upon the mountains of spices.
SNG.3.1	On my bed in the night I longed for the one my soul loves. I looked for him but did not find him. 
SNG.3.2	I will get up and go about the city, into the streets and into the squares. I must seek the one my soul loves. I looked for him but did not find him. 
SNG.3.3	The guards patrolling the city found me. “Have you seen the one my soul loves?” 
SNG.3.4	Hardly had I passed beyond them when I found the one my soul loves. I held him, and I would not let him go, until I brought him to my mother’s house, to the chamber of her who conceived me. 
SNG.3.5	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you, by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it delights.
SNG.3.6	Who is this—she who is coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with every powder of the merchant? 
SNG.3.7	Behold, it is Solomon’s traveling couch— around it are sixty warriors from the warriors of Israel. 
SNG.3.8	All of them wield a sword, experts in war. Each man with his sword on his thigh against terrors of the night. 
SNG.3.9	King Solomon has made for himself a carriage from the trees of Lebanon. 
SNG.3.10	He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple cloth, its interior fitted out with love by the daughters of Jerusalem. 
SNG.3.11	Go out, daughters of Zion, and gaze upon King Solomon, with a wreath his mother placed on him on the day of his marriage— on the day of his heart’s joy. 
SNG.4.1	How lovely you are, my darling, how lovely! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of ewe goats descending down from Mount Gilead. 
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes coming up from washing. Each of them has a twin, and none among them is missing. 
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a scarlet thread and your speech is lovely. Your temple is like a slice of pomegranate behind your veil. 
SNG.4.4	 Like the tower of David is your neck, built for weapons. A thousand shields are hung on it —all shields of warriors. 
SNG.4.5	Your two breasts are like two fawns, like twin gazelles grazing among the lilies. 
SNG.4.6	Until the day cools and the shadows flee away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense. 
SNG.4.7	You are altogether lovely, my darling, and no blemish is in you. 
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Watch from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir, even Hermon, from lions’ dens, from mountains of leopards. 
SNG.4.9	You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride— you captivated me with one of your eyes, with one jewel from your necklace. 
SNG.4.10	How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils better than all spices! 
SNG.4.11	Your lips, my bride, drip honey from the honeycomb. Honey and milk are under your tongue. The scent of your garments is like the aroma of Lebanon. 
SNG.4.12	A locked garden is my sister, my bride, an enclosed spring, a sealed fountain. 
SNG.4.13	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruit, henna with nard 
SNG.4.14	—nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon— with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices— 
SNG.4.15	a garden spring, a well of living water and flowing streams from Lebanon. 
SNG.4.16	Awake, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, Let its fragrance spread out. Let my lover come into his garden and eat its choicest fruit. 
SNG.5.1	I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey. I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, Drink, yes, drink your fill, O lovers! 
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart is awake. A voice! My lover is knocking! “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, my locks with dewdrops of night.” 
SNG.5.3	I have stripped off my coat. How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet. How can I soil them? 
SNG.5.4	My lover extended his hand through the opening —my heart yearned for him. 
SNG.5.5	I rose to open for my lover. My hands dripped with myrrh, yes, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock. 
SNG.5.6	I opened to my lover— but my lover had departed, he was gone! My soul went out to him when he spoke. I searched for him, but did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer me. 
SNG.5.7	The guards making rounds in the city found me. They beat me, bruised me. The guards on the walls took my veil from me. 
SNG.5.8	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you, if you should find my lover, what will you tell him? That I am sick from love! 
SNG.5.9	How is your lover different from other lovers, O most beautiful among women? How is your lover different from other lovers that you charge us so? 
SNG.5.10	My lover is dazzling and ruddy, standing out among ten thousand. 
SNG.5.11	His head is purest gold, his hair is wavy, black as a raven. 
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, washed with milk, mounted in their settings. 
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like a bed of spice, towers of sweet-scented perfume. His lips are lilies, dripping with liquid myrrh. 
SNG.5.14	His hands are rods of gold set with jasper. His abdomen is carved ivory inlaid with sapphires. 
SNG.5.15	His legs are pillars of alabaster set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon— excellent like the cedars. 
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweetness. Yes, he is totally desirable. This is my lover! Yes, this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. 
SNG.6.1	Where has your lover gone, most beautiful among women? Where has your lover turned, so we may seek him with you? 
SNG.6.2	My lover went down to his garden, to the beds of balsam to graze his flocks in the gardens and to gather lilies. 
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine. He browses among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	You are beautiful, my darling, like Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. 
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me! Your hair is like a flock of ewe goats descending down from Gilead. 
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing. Each of them has a twin, and none among them is missing. 
SNG.6.7	Your temple is like a slice of pomegranate behind your veil. 
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and young women beyond number. 
SNG.6.9	Yet my dove, my perfect one is unique. She is her mother’s only one— a virtuous child of the one who bore her. Maidens saw her and called her blessed. Queens and concubines praised her. 
SNG.6.10	Who is this that appears like dawn? As beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners. 
SNG.6.11	I went down into the garden of nut trees to look at the fruit of the valley, to see if the vine had budded, or the pomegranates had bloomed. 
SNG.6.12	Before I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people.
SNG.7.1	Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may look upon you. Why do you gaze at the Shulammite like the dance of Mahanaim? 
SNG.7.2	How lovely are your sandaled feet, O nobleman’s daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of a craftsman’s hand. 
SNG.7.3	Your navel is a round goblet, may it not lack mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat enclosed with lilies. 
SNG.7.4	Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 
SNG.7.5	Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon near the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus. 
SNG.7.6	Your head crowns you like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple. The king is captivated in its tresses! 
SNG.7.7	How beautiful and how pleasing you are, O Love, with your delights! 
SNG.7.8	Your stature is like a date palm and your breasts like its clusters. 
SNG.7.9	I said, “I will climb the date palm and take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apple. 
SNG.7.10	May your mouth be like the best wine, going down smoothly for my beloved, causing the lips of sleepers to speak. 
SNG.7.11	I am my lover’s, and his desire is for me. 
SNG.7.12	Come, my beloved, let us go out into the field. Let us spend the night in the villages. 
SNG.7.13	Let us go out early to the vineyards, —let us see if the vine has budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates have bloomed— there I will give you my love. 
SNG.7.14	The mandrakes have given off fragrance, and over our door is every choice fruit, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my lover.
SNG.8.1	O, that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my mother’s breasts. If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me. 
SNG.8.2	I would lead you and bring you into my mother’s house— she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink from the nectar of my pomegranate. 
SNG.8.3	O that his left hand were under my head, and his right hand embraced me. 
SNG.8.4	 I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, Do not arouse or awaken love until it so delights. 
SNG.8.5	Who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you. There your mother travailed with you. There she who was in labor gave you birth. 
SNG.8.6	Set me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, jealousy as cruel as 
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love, nor rivers wash it away. If one gave all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly despised. 
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister, still without breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for? 
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door, we will fence her in with cedar plank. 
SNG.8.10	I am a wall, and my breasts like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes as one bringing 
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon. He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each was to bring for his fruit a thousand pieces of silver. 
SNG.8.12	My very own vineyard is before me. The thousand are for you, Solomon, and two hundred for those who tend the fruit. 
SNG.8.13	You who abide in the gardens, friends are listening for your voice. Let me hear it! 
SNG.8.14	Come quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices! 
RUT.1.1	It came to pass in the days when judges were governing, there was a famine in the land. A man went from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to dwell in the region of Moab with his wife and his two sons. 
RUT.1.2	The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and his two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephratites from Bethlehem in Judah. They came to the region of Moab and remained there. 
RUT.1.3	Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, so she was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	They married Moabite women—one was named Orpah and the second was named Ruth, and they dwelt there about ten years. 
RUT.1.5	Then those two, Mahlon and Chilion, also died. So the woman was left without her children and her husband. 
RUT.1.6	Then she got up, along with her daughters-in-law to return from the region of Moab, because in the region of Moab she had heard that 
RUT.1.7	So she left the place where she was, along with her two daughters-in-law, and they started out on the road to return to the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	So Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to your mother’s house. May 
RUT.1.9	May 
RUT.1.10	“No!” they said to her, “we will return with you to your people.” 
RUT.1.11	Now Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters! Why should you go with me? Do I have more sons in my womb who could become your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	Go home, my daughters! I am too old to have a husband. Even if I were to say that there was hope for me and I could get married tonight, and then bore sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you wait for them to grow up? Would you therefore hold off getting married? No, my daughters, it is more bitter for me than for you—for the hand of 
RUT.1.14	Again they broke into loud weeping. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye. But Ruth clung to her. 
RUT.1.15	She said, “Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Return, along with your sister-in-law!” 
RUT.1.16	Ruth replied, “Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from following you. For where you go, I will go, and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God. 
RUT.1.17	Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May 
RUT.1.18	When she saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she no longer spoke to Ruth about it. 
RUT.1.19	So the two of them went on until they arrived in Bethlehem. As soon as they arrived in Bethlehem the whole city was excited because of them, and the women asked, “Is this Naomi?” 
RUT.1.20	“Do not call me Naomi,” she told them. “Call me Mara—since 
RUT.1.21	I went away full, but 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess returned from the region of Moab. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. 
RUT.2.1	Now, Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side—from Elimelech’s family—a prominent man of substance whose name was Boaz. 
RUT.2.2	Ruth the Moabitess, said to Naomi, “Please let me go out to the field and glean grain behind anyone in whose eyes I may find favor.” Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	So Ruth went out and gleaned in the field behind the reapers. She just so happened to be in the field of Boaz, who was from Elimelech’s family. 
RUT.2.4	Soon after Boaz arrived from Bethlehem, he said to the harvesters, “
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?” 
RUT.2.6	“She is a Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the region of Moab,” the foreman replied. 
RUT.2.7	“She asked ‘Please allow me to glean and gather among the barley sheaves behind the harvesters.’ So she came and has been working in the field since morning until now, except for a little while in the shelter.” 
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen to me, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field or even pass on from here, but stay close to my female workers. 
RUT.2.9	Keep your eyes on the field that they are harvesting, and follow after them. I strongly ordered the young men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, you can go to the jars and drink from the water the young men have drawn.” 
RUT.2.10	Then she fell upon her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes that you have noticed me, even though I am a foreigner?” 
RUT.2.11	Boaz replied and said to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband’s death has been fully reported to me—how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people you did not know before. 
RUT.2.12	May 
RUT.2.13	She said, “May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your maidservant, even though I am not one of your maidservants.” 
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here and eat some bread and dip your piece into the wine vinegar.” So she sat beside the harvesters and he held out to her roasted grain. She ate until she was full, and some was still left. 
RUT.2.15	When she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his workers saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, do not humiliate her. 
RUT.2.16	Also be sure to pull out some grain for her from the sheaves and leave them for her to pick up, and do not rebuke her.” 
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until evening. When she thrashed what she had gathered, there was about an ephah of barley. 
RUT.2.18	She carried it back to town, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth took some out and gave her what was left over after eating her fill. 
RUT.2.19	Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? May the one who noticed you be blessed!” She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and she said, “The name of the man for whom I worked is Boaz.” 
RUT.2.20	So Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by 
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay close to my workers until they have finished the entire harvest.’” 
RUT.2.22	Naomi answered her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is good, my daughter-in-law, that you go out with his female workers, so that you will not be harmed in another field.” 
RUT.2.23	So she stayed close to Boaz’s female workers, gleaning until both the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were completed. Meanwhile she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Naomi her mother-in-law said to her “My daughter, should I not be seeking a resting place for you, so it may go well for you? 
RUT.3.2	Now, is Boaz, with whose female workers you have been, not our relative? Look, he will be winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. 
RUT.3.3	So bathe and perfume yourself, put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	Let it be that when he lies down and you know the place where he lies down, go uncover his feet and lie down there. He will tell you what to do.” 
RUT.3.5	Ruth answered her, “I will do everything you say.” 
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had said. 
RUT.3.7	After Boaz ate, drank, and was in a good mood, he went to lie down at the far side of the grain pile. So she came to the grain pile quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. 
RUT.3.8	Now in the middle of the night, the man was startled and pulled back—and to his surprise, a woman was lying at his feet! 
RUT.3.9	“Who are you?” he asked. “I am Ruth, your handmaid,” she answered. “Spread the corner of your garment over your handmaid, for you are a 
RUT.3.10	“May you be blessed by 
RUT.3.11	Now my daughter, do not be afraid! Everything you propose, I will do for you, for everyone in town knows that you are a woman of valor. 
RUT.3.12	Although it is true that I am a 
RUT.3.13	Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he will be your 
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before one person could be distinguished from another, for he said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” 
RUT.3.15	Then he said, “Bring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out.” She held it out and he poured six measures of barley into it and put it on her. Then he returned to town. 
RUT.3.16	When Ruth came back to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?” So Ruth told her all that the man had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	She said “He gave me six measures of barley, for he said, ‘You shouldn’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” 
RUT.3.18	“Wait, my daughter,” Naomi said, “until you find out how the matter turns out, for he will not rest until he has settled the matter today.” 
RUT.4.1	Meanwhile Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there. And all of a sudden, the 
RUT.4.2	Then Boaz took ten of the town’s elders and said, “Sit down here,” so they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	Then he said to the 
RUT.4.4	I thought I should inform you saying, ‘Buy it in the presence of the people sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, redeem it. But if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, so that I can know, because there is no one else in line to redeem it. I am after you.’” “I will redeem it,” he said. 
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi’s hand, you will also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased over his inheritance.” 
RUT.4.6	The kinsman said, “Then I cannot redeem it for myself, or else I might endanger my own inheritance. You, take my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.” 
RUT.4.7	Now in the past in Israel, one removed his sandal and gave it to another, in order to finalize the redemption and transfer of a matter. This was a legal transaction in Israel. 
RUT.4.8	So the kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” then took off his shoe. 
RUT.4.9	Boaz announced to the elders and all the people: “You are witnesses today that I have bought from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased over his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the gate of his town. You are witnesses today.” 
RUT.4.11	All the people at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May 
RUT.4.12	May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the seed that 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. When he went to her, 
RUT.4.14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be 
RUT.4.15	Moreover, He will be to you a renewer of life and a sustainer of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.” 
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the child and held it to her bosom, and took care of him. 
RUT.4.17	The neighboring women gave him a name saying “A son has been born to Naomi!” So they called him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
RUT.4.18	These are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron, 
RUT.4.19	Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab, 
RUT.4.20	Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon, 
RUT.4.21	Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed, 
RUT.4.22	Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.
LAM.1.1	How lonely sits the city, once so full of people! She who was once great among the nations has become like a widow. The princess among the provinces has become a forced laborer. 
LAM.1.2	Bitterly she weeps in the night, her tears are on her cheeks. Among all her lovers, there is no one to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her. They have become her enemies! 
LAM.1.3	Judah is gone into exile under affliction and great servitude. She dwells among the nations. She finds no resting place. All her pursuers have overtaken her in the midst of her distress. 
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion mourn for no one comes to her 
LAM.1.5	Her foes have become her masters. Her enemies are at ease. For 
LAM.1.6	All her splendor has departed, from the daughter of Zion. Her princes are like stags that find no pasture. They have fled without strength before the pursuer. 
LAM.1.7	In the days of her affliction and her wandering, Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers from the days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies saw her and mocked at her destruction. 
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem has greatly sinned— therefore, she has become 
LAM.1.9	Her uncleanness was in her skirts. She did not consider her future. Her demise was astonishing, there was no one to comfort her. “
LAM.1.10	The enemy has stretched his hand over all her treasures. She even saw nations enter her sanctuary— those You had commanded not to enter Your congregation. 
LAM.1.11	All her people groan, as they seek bread. They traded their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. “Look, 
LAM.1.12	“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by on the road? Look and see! Is any suffering like my suffering that was brought on me, that 
LAM.1.13	From on high He sent fire into my bones and it overcame them. He spread out a net for my feet; He turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long. 
LAM.1.14	My transgressions are bound into a yoke, woven together by His hand. They have come upon my neck and He has sapped my strength. The Lord delivered me over to those I cannot withstand. 
LAM.1.15	The Lord has rejected all the mighty ones in my midst. He has summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men. In a winepress the Lord has trampled the virgin daughter of Judah. 
LAM.1.16	Over these things I weep. My eyes overflow with water. For far from me is a comforter, who might refresh my soul. My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.” 
LAM.1.17	Zion spreads out her hands— there is no one to comfort her. 
LAM.1.18	“
LAM.1.19	I called to my lovers— they deceived me! My 
LAM.1.20	Look, 
LAM.1.21	They have heard me groaning. There is no one to comfort me. All my enemies heard of my distress, They rejoice that You have done it. May You bring about the day that You proclaimed, so they may become like me! 
LAM.1.22	Let all their evil come before You. Deal with them as you dealt with me, because of all my transgressions. For my groans are many and my heart is faint!” 
LAM.2.1	How my Lord has clouded over the daughter of Zion in His anger! He hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth. He has not remembered His footstool in the day of His anger. 
LAM.2.2	My Lord has mercilessly swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob. He threw down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah in His fury. He knocked to the ground and humiliated the kingdom and its princes. 
LAM.2.3	In fierce anger He has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn His right hand from before the enemy. He blazed against Jacob like raging fire, devouring everything around. 
LAM.2.4	He bent His bow like an enemy, set His right hand like a foe, and killed all those pleasant to the eye. In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire. 
LAM.2.5	My Lord is like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. He swallowed up all her citadels, destroyed her fortifications and multiplied mourning and moaning for the daughter of Judah. 
LAM.2.6	Like the garden He laid waste His dwelling, destroyed His appointed meeting place. 
LAM.2.7	The Lord rejected His altar, despised His Sanctuary. He has delivered the walls of her citadels into the hand of the enemy. They raised a shout in the house of 
LAM.2.8	 resolved to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line. He did not withdraw His hand from destroying. He caused rampart and wall to lament— together they languished away. 
LAM.2.9	Her gates sank into the ground. Her bars He destroyed and shattered. Her king and princes are among nations. There is no more 
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground in silence. They threw dust on their heads and girded themselves with sackcloth. The maidens of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground. 
LAM.2.11	My eyes are filled with tears. My stomach is in torment. My heart is poured out on the ground over the destruction of the daughter of my people— as young children and infants languish in the city squares. 
LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers, “Where is grain and wine?” as they faint like a wounded soldier in the city squares, as their lives ebb away in their mothers’ bosom. 
LAM.2.13	How can I admonish you? To what can I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, so that I might console you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your wound is as deep as the sea! Who can heal you? 
LAM.2.14	Your prophets have seen for you false and worthless visions. They did not expose your iniquity, so as to restore your captivity. Rather, they have seen for you false and worthless oracles. 
LAM.2.15	All who pass your way clap their hands at you. They hiss and shake their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem. “Is this the city of which they said, ‘The perfection of beauty,’ ‘the joy of the whole earth’?” 
LAM.2.16	All your enemies opened their mouth wide against you; they hissed and gnashed their teeth, and say, “We have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it!” 
LAM.2.17	 has done what He planned; He has fulfilled His word that He commanded from days of old. He has overthrown you without pity, He enabled the enemy to gloat over you. He has exalted the horn of your foes. 
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried out to the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night. Give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest. 
LAM.2.19	Arise! Cry out in the night at the beginning of the watches! Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to Him for the life of your children who faint from hunger at the head of every street. 
LAM.2.20	Look, 
LAM.2.21	On the ground in the streets lie both young and old. My maidens and my young men have fallen by the sword. You slew them in the day of Your anger. You slaughtered them without pity. 
LAM.2.22	As on a 
LAM.3.1	I am the strong man who has seen affliction by the rod of His wrath. 
LAM.3.2	He has driven me and made me walk in darkness and not light. 
LAM.3.3	Surely, He has turned His hand against me again and again all day long. 
LAM.3.4	He made my flesh and my skin waste away, broken my bones. 
LAM.3.5	He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. 
LAM.3.6	He made me dwell in dark places like those long dead. 
LAM.3.7	He has walled me in so I cannot get out. He made my chain heavy. 
LAM.3.8	Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer. 
LAM.3.9	He walled in my ways with hewn stone. He twisted my paths. 
LAM.3.10	He is a lurking bear to me, a lion in hiding. 
LAM.3.11	He turned aside my paths and tore me to pieces. He has made me desolate. 
LAM.3.12	He bent His bow and made me the target for His arrow. 
LAM.3.13	He shot into my kidneys arrows from His quiver. 
LAM.3.14	I have become a laughing stock to all my people, their song all day long. 
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness and made me drink wormwood. 
LAM.3.16	He broke my teeth with gravel. He made me wallow in ashes. 
LAM.3.17	My soul has been deprived of 
LAM.3.18	So I said, “My endurance has perished, and my hope from 
LAM.3.19	Remember my affliction my homelessness, bitterness and gall. 
LAM.3.20	Whenever I remember, my soul is downcast within me. 
LAM.3.21	This I recall to my heart— therefore I have hope: 
LAM.3.22	Because of the mercies of 
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning! Great is Your faithfulness. 
LAM.3.24	“
LAM.3.25	 is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul that seeks Him. 
LAM.3.26	It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth. 
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone and be silent, since He has laid it upon him. 
LAM.3.29	Let him put his mouth in the dust— there may yet be hope.
LAM.3.30	Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes him. Let him have his fill of disgrace. 
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not reject forever. 
LAM.3.32	For though He has caused grief, yet He will have compassion according to His abundant mercies. 
LAM.3.33	For He does not afflict from His heart or grieve the sons of men. 
LAM.3.34	To crush under His foot all the prisoners of the land, 
LAM.3.35	to deprive a person of justice before the face of Elyon, 
LAM.3.36	to defraud a person in his lawsuit— would the Lord not see? 
LAM.3.37	Who speaks and it comes to pass unless the Lord has decreed it? 
LAM.3.38	Is it not from the mouth of Elyon that both calamities and good things proceed? 
LAM.3.39	Why should any living person complain when punished for his sins? 
LAM.3.40	Let us examine and test our ways, and let us return to 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our heart and hands to God in heaven. 
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and rebelled— You have not pardoned. 
LAM.3.43	You covered Yourself with anger and pursued us. You have slain without pity. 
LAM.3.44	You shrouded Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through. 
LAM.3.45	You have made us scum and refuse in the midst of the peoples. 
LAM.3.46	All our enemies opened their mouth wide against us. 
LAM.3.47	Panic and pitfall have befallen us, devastation and destruction. 
LAM.3.48	Streams of tears run down my eyes because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
LAM.3.49	My eye flows unceasingly, without stopping, 
LAM.3.50	until 
LAM.3.51	My eye torments my soul because of all the daughters of my city. 
LAM.3.52	For no reason, my enemies hunted me down like a bird. 
LAM.3.53	They cut off my life in the Pit, and cast stones upon me. 
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over my head. I said, “I have been cut off!” 
LAM.3.55	I called on Your Name, 
LAM.3.56	You heard my voice, “Do not close Your ears to my cry for relief.” 
LAM.3.57	You drew near on the day I called to You. You said, “Do not fear!” 
LAM.3.58	Lord, You pled my soul’s case, You redeemed my life. 
LAM.3.59	, You saw the wrong done to me; judge my cause! 
LAM.3.60	You have seen all their vengefulness, all their schemes against me. 
LAM.3.61	You heard their taunt, 
LAM.3.62	The lips of my assailants and their whispering are against me all day long. 
LAM.3.63	Look at them, sitting or standing, they mock me in their song. 
LAM.3.64	Pay them back what they deserve, 
LAM.3.65	Give them a distraught heart. May Your curse be on them. 
LAM.3.66	Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of 
LAM.4.1	How dulled is the gold, how tarnished the fine gold. The sacred gems are poured out at the corner of every street. 
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in gold— alas! now they are treated like clay jars, the work of a potter’s hands! 
LAM.4.3	Even jackals offer their breast to nurse their young. The daughter of my people has become cruel, like ostriches in the desert. 
LAM.4.4	The nursing infant’s tongue clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst. Little children ask for bread, but no one gives it t0 them. 
LAM.4.5	Those who used to eat delicacies are desolate in the streets. Those who were brought up in purple embrace trash heaps. 
LAM.4.6	For the iniquities of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, yet no hands turned to her. 
LAM.4.7	Purer than snow were her princes, whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphire. 
LAM.4.8	Their form has become darker than soot! They are not recognized in the street. Their skin has shriveled on their bones, withered like a tree. 
LAM.4.9	Better are those slain by the sword than those struck down by famine— they waste away, racked with pain, for lack of fruits of the field. 
LAM.4.10	The hands of compassionate women boiled their own children. They became their food when the daughter of my people were destroyed. 
LAM.4.11	 has vented His fury. He has poured out His burning anger. Yes, He kindled a fire in Zion that devoured her foundations. 
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did the inhabitations of the world, that enemy and foe would enter the gates of Jerusalem. 
LAM.4.13	Yet it happened because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her 
LAM.4.14	They wander in the streets, like blind men. They are so defiled with blood, no one can touch their garments. 
LAM.4.15	“Turn away! Unclean!” They cry to them. “Turn away, turn away! Don’t touch!” So they fled and wandered about. People among the nations say, “They can stay here no longer.” 
LAM.4.16	 Himself has scattered them. He will look on them no more. They did not respect the 
LAM.4.17	Even now our eyes waste away looking in vain for our help. From our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us. 
LAM.4.18	They hunted our steps, so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near. Our days were numbered, for our end had come. 
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter than eagles of the sky; they pursued us over the mountains; they ambushed us in the wilderness. 
LAM.4.20	The anointed of 
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. To you also will the cup be passed. You will be drunk and stripped naked. 
LAM.4.22	O daughter of Zion, your punishment is accomplished; He will exile you no longer. But, O daughter of Edom, He will punish your iniquity and uncover your sins.
LAM.5.1	Remember, 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. 
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans, fatherless, our mothers are like widows. 
LAM.5.4	We pay silver for the water we drink; our wood comes at a price. 
LAM.5.5	Our pursuers are at our necks. We are weary and have no rest. 
LAM.5.6	We have held out our hand to Egypt and Assyria to be satisfied with bread. 
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned and are no more, but we bear their punishment. 
LAM.5.8	Slaves rule over us. There is no one to deliver us from their hand. 
LAM.5.9	We get our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword in the desert. 
LAM.5.10	Our skin is hot as an oven due to fever from famine. 
LAM.5.11	The women in Zion have been ravished, maidens in the towns of Judah. 
LAM.5.12	Princes are hung up by their hands; elders are dishonored. 
LAM.5.13	Young men toil at the millstone. Boys stagger under loads of wood. 
LAM.5.14	Elders are gone from the gate, young men from their music. 
LAM.5.15	Joy has ceased in our hearts. Our dance has turned into mourning. 
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head. 
LAM.5.17	Because of this our heart is faint, for these things our eyes are dim, 
LAM.5.18	for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, as jackals prowl over it.
LAM.5.19	You, 
LAM.5.20	Why do You always forget us and forsake us for so long? 
LAM.5.21	Bring us back to You, 
LAM.5.22	unless You have utterly rejected us and are exceedingly angry with us. 
ECC.1.1	The words of 
ECC.1.2	Futile! Futile! says 
ECC.1.3	What does a person gain in all his labor that he toils under the sun? 
ECC.1.4	A generation comes, and a generation goes, but the earth remains forever. 
ECC.1.5	The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to the place it rises. 
ECC.1.6	The wind goes toward the south, and circles around to the north. Round and round it swirls about, ever returning to its circuits. 
ECC.1.7	All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they go again. 
ECC.1.8	All things are wearisome. No one can express them. The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 
ECC.1.9	What has been is what will be, and what has been done will be done again. There is nothing new under the sun. 
ECC.1.10	Is there anything about which is said, “Look! This is new!”? It was already here long ago, in the ages long before us. 
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance for former things, and things yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.
ECC.1.12	I, 
ECC.1.13	I applied my heart to seek and examine by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a burdensome task God has given the sons of men to keep them occupied. 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the deeds done under the sun; and behold, all is meaningless and chasing after the wind. 
ECC.1.15	What is crooked cannot be made straight. What is missing cannot be counted. 
ECC.1.16	I spoke with my heart saying: “I have grown rich and increased in wisdom more than any who were before me over Jerusalem. Indeed, my heart has experienced much wisdom and knowledge.” 
ECC.1.17	So I applied my heart to know wisdom as well as to know madness and folly. I learned that this too was pursuit of the wind. 
ECC.1.18	For with much wisdom comes much grief, and whoever keeps increasing knowledge, increases heartache. 
ECC.2.1	I said within myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to see what is good.” Yet behold, this too was meaningless. 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, “It is madness!” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?” 
ECC.2.3	I thought deeply about how to cheer my flesh with wine—letting my heart guide me with wisdom—and how to grasp folly, so that I could see what was worthwhile for the sons of men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives. 
ECC.2.4	I increased my possessions. I built myself houses and I planted myself vineyards. 
ECC.2.5	I made royal gardens and parks for myself, and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
ECC.2.6	I constructed for myself pools of water to irrigate a forest of flourishing trees. 
ECC.2.7	I purchased male and female servants and had other servants who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than all my predecessors in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	I also amassed silver and gold for myself, as well as the treasure of kings and the provinces. I acquired male and female singers for myself, as well as the luxuries of humankind—vaults and vaults of them. 
ECC.2.9	So I became far wealthier than all before me in Jerusalem, yet my wisdom stayed with me. 
ECC.2.10	I denied myself nothing that my eyes desired; I withheld from my heart no enjoyment. My heart took delight from all my toil— this was my reward for all my labor. 
ECC.2.11	Yet when I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended to accomplish it, behold, it all was futile and chasing after the wind. There was nothing to be gained under the sun. 
ECC.2.12	Then I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly. For what more can the one who succeeds the king do than what he has already done? 
ECC.2.13	I realized that: Wisdom is more beneficial than folly as light is better than darkness. 
ECC.2.14	A wise man has his eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness. Yet, I also came to realize that the same destiny befalls them both. 
ECC.2.15	Then said I in my heart: “I, even I, will have the same destiny as a fool. So why have I become so wise?” I said in my heart, “This too is meaningless.” 
ECC.2.16	For the wise man, together with the fool, is not remembered forever. For in the days to come both will be forgotten. Alas, the wise, just like the fool, must die! 
ECC.2.17	And so I hated life, because the work done under the sun was grievous to me. All is but vapor and chasing after the wind. 
ECC.2.18	I also hated all the fruit of my toil for which I had labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the one who comes after me. 
ECC.2.19	Who knows if he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my toil for which I had wisely labored under the sun. This too is futile. 
ECC.2.20	So I turned my heart over to despair over all the things for which I had toiled under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For sometimes a man, who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, must hand over as an inheritance to someone who did not work for it. This also is futile and a great misfortune. 
ECC.2.22	For what does a man get for all his toil and longing of his heart for which he labors under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	For all his days, his work is pain and grief. Even at night his mind does not rest. This also is futility. 
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink, and to find enjoyment in their labor. This too, I perceived, is from the hand of God. 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat and who can have joy, apart from Him? 
ECC.2.26	For to the one who pleases Him, He gives wisdom, knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and accumulating wealth to give it to one who pleases God. This also is only vapor and striving after the wind. 
ECC.3.1	For everything there is a season and a time for every activity under heaven: 
ECC.3.2	a time to give birth and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted; 
ECC.3.3	a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build up; 
ECC.3.4	a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance; 
ECC.3.5	a time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing; 
ECC.3.6	a time to seek and a time to lose, a time to keep and a time to discard; 
ECC.3.7	a time to tear apart and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak; 
ECC.3.8	a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. 
ECC.3.9	What gain, then, does the laborer get with his toil? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the task that God has given to the children of men to keep them occupied. 
ECC.3.11	He has made everything beautiful in its time. Moreover, He has set eternity in their heart—yet without the possibility that humankind can ever discover the work that God has done from the beginning to the end. 
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy themselves in their lifetime. 
ECC.3.13	Also when anyone eats and drinks, and finds satisfaction in all of his labor, it is the gift of God. 
ECC.3.14	I know that everything that God does will endure forever. There is no adding to it or taking from it. God has made it so, that they will revere Him. 
ECC.3.15	Whatever exists, has already been and whatever will be, has already been, but God recalls what has passed. 
ECC.3.16	I have also seen under the sun: In the place of justice there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there was wickedness. 
ECC.3.17	I said in my heart: “The righteous and the wicked, God will judge. For there is a time for every activity and for every deed.” 
ECC.3.18	I also said in my heart, “As for the sons of man, God tests them so that they may see that they are but animals.” 
ECC.3.19	For the destiny of humankind and the destiny of animals are one and the same. As one dies, so dies the other. Both have the same breath—a human has no advantage over an animal—both are fleeting. 
ECC.3.20	Both go to one place. Both were taken from the dust, and both return to the dust. 
ECC.3.21	Who knows that the spirit of the sons of man ascends upward and the animal’s spirit descends into the earth? 
ECC.3.22	So I perceived that nothing is better than for man to enjoy his works, because that is his portion. For who can bring him back to see what will be in the future? 
ECC.4.1	Again I looked and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun, and behold, I saw the tears of the oppressed, but they have no comforter. Power is in the hand of their oppressors, but they had no comforter. 
ECC.4.2	So I considered the dead, who are already dead, more fortunate than the living, who are still alive. 
ECC.4.3	Yet better than both is one who has not yet been, who has never seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 
ECC.4.4	Then I saw that all toil and all skill that is done come from man’s envy of his neighbor; this too is fleeting and striving after the wind. 
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh. 
ECC.4.6	Better is a handful with tranquility than two handfuls of toil and striving after the wind. 
ECC.4.7	Again I saw something futile under the sun: 
ECC.4.8	There is one who has no one else, neither son nor brother, yet there is no end to all his toil. His eyes are not content with riches. “So, for whom am I toiling, and depriving myself of prosperity?” This too is meaningless— a grievous task!
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one, because they get a good return for their effort. 
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion. But oy to the one who falls and has no one to lift him up! 
ECC.4.11	Furthermore, if two lie together, then they will be warm. But how can one keep warm alone? 
ECC.4.12	Though a man might overpower one, two can stand against him. Moreover a threefold cord cannot be quickly broken. 
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning. 
ECC.4.14	For he came out of prison to become king—though he was born poor in his kingdom. 
ECC.4.15	I considered all the living that walk under the sun as well as the next youth who stands in his place. 
ECC.4.16	There is no end to all the people—to all who were before him. Also those who will come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this too is meaningless and striving after the wind. 
ECC.4.17	Watch your feet when you go to the House of God. Draw near to listen, rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing wrong. 
ECC.5.1	Do not be quick with your mouth nor hasty in your heart to utter a word in God’s presence. For God is in heaven, and you are on the earth— therefore, let your words be few. 
ECC.5.2	As a dream comes with excessive burdens so a fool’s voice with too many words. 
ECC.5.3	When you swear a vow to God, don’t delay in fulfilling it. For He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow! 
ECC.5.4	It is better for you not to vow than to vow and not pay. 
ECC.5.5	Don’t let your mouth lead your flesh to sin, and don’t say before the messenger, “It was a mistake!” Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands? 
ECC.5.6	Many dreams and many words are meaningless. Therefore, fear God!
ECC.5.7	If you see the oppression of the poor or perversion of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the matter. For one authority watches over another authority, and higher ones are over them. 
ECC.5.8	Though the profit of the land is taken by all, a king is served by the fields. 
ECC.5.9	A lover of money never has enough money, and a lover of wealth is never satisfied with his income. This too is futile. 
ECC.5.10	When goods increase, so do those who consume them. So what advantage are they to the owner except he sees it with his eyes? 
ECC.5.11	The sleep of the laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much— but the excess of the rich permits him no sleep. 
ECC.5.12	There is a grievous wrong that I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded by its owner to his own hurt, 
ECC.5.13	or wealth lost in a bad investment, and when he fathers a son, there is nothing in his hand. 
ECC.5.14	As he came from his mother’s womb, naked he will return as he came. He takes nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand. 
ECC.5.15	This too is a grievous wrong. Just as he came, so will he go, so what does he gain, from his toiling for the wind? 
ECC.5.16	So, all his days he eats in darkness, and he has much grief, sickness, and humiliation. 
ECC.5.17	Behold, this is what I myself have seen. It is beneficial and good for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy all of his toil that he labors under the sun during the few days of his life that God has given him—for this is his reward. 
ECC.5.18	Additionally, everyone to whom God has given riches and wealth, and empowers him to eat from it, to receive his share, and to rejoice in his labor—this is a gift of God. 
ECC.5.19	For he will not often consider the days of his life, since God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
ECC.6.1	There is a misery that I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon humanity. 
ECC.6.2	God gives a man riches, wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires, yet God does not enable him to eat from it—instead a foreigner will eat it. This is fruitless—an agonizing illness. 
ECC.6.3	Even if a man should father a hundred children and live many years, however many the days of his years may be, yet his soul is never satisfied with his prosperity and he does not have a proper burial, then I say that it is better for the stillborn than him. 
ECC.6.4	Even though it comes in futility and departs into darkness, though its name is shrouded in darkness, 
ECC.6.5	though it has never seen or experienced the sun, it has more rest than the other. 
ECC.6.6	Even if the other man were to live a thousand years twice and never enjoy good things—do not all go to the same place? 
ECC.6.7	All a man’s labor is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. 
ECC.6.8	So what advantage has the wise over the fool? What does the pauper gain by knowing how to walk before the living? 
ECC.6.9	Better is what the eyes see than the pursuit of the soul’s desires. This too is fleeting and striving after wind. 
ECC.6.10	Whatever exists has already been named, and it has been made known what humanity is. But man cannot contend with the One who is mightier than he. 
ECC.6.11	When there are many words, futility increases! How does that benefit anyone? 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for one during his life—during the few days of his fleeting life—that pass like a shadow? For who can tell a person what happens after him under the sun?
ECC.7.1	Better is a good reputation than precious oil and the day of death than the day of birth. 
ECC.7.2	Better to go to a house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, since that is the end of all mankind —and the living should take it to heart. 
ECC.7.3	Grief is better than laughter, for though the face is sad, the heart may be glad. 
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in a house of pleasure. 
ECC.7.5	Better to hear a rebuke from the wise than to listen to the song of fools. 
ECC.7.6	For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is vapor. 
ECC.7.7	For extortion drives a wise man crazy, and a bribe corrupts the heart. 
ECC.7.8	Better the end of a matter than its beginning. Better a patient spirit than a proud one. 
ECC.7.9	Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger settles in the bosom of fools. 
ECC.7.10	Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this. 
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and even better for those who see the sun. 
ECC.7.12	For wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: wisdom preserves the life of the one who possesses it. 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God, for who can straighten what He has bent? 
ECC.7.14	In a time of prosperity, prosper! But in a time of adversity, consider: God has made one as well as the other. Therefore man cannot discover anything about his future. 
ECC.7.15	During my fleeting days I have seen both of these things: sometimes a righteous one perishes in his righteousness and sometimes a wicked one lives long in his wickedness. 
ECC.7.16	Do not be overly righteous nor overly wise— why confound yourself? 
ECC.7.17	Do not be overly wicked and do not be a fool— why die before your time? 
ECC.7.18	It is good to grasp the one and not withdraw your hand from the other. For the one who fears God will escape both extremes. 
ECC.7.19	Wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a city. 
ECC.7.20	Surely there is not a righteous person on earth who does what is good and doesn’t sin. 
ECC.7.21	Also, do not pay attention to every word people say, otherwise you might hear your servant mocking you— 
ECC.7.22	for your heart knows that many times you too have mocked others. 
ECC.7.23	All this I have tested with wisdom and I said, “I determined to be wise”—but it was far from me. 
ECC.7.24	Whatever it may be, it is far off and very profound—who can fathom it? 
ECC.7.25	So I turned my heart to understand, to search and seek out wisdom and an explanation of things and to know the stupidity of wickedness and madness of folly. 
ECC.7.26	I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap, and whose hands are chains. He who pleases God will escape her, but a sinner will be captured by her. 
ECC.7.27	“Look,” said 
ECC.7.28	which my soul is still seeking, but not finding—I found one upright man among a thousand, but one upright woman among them all I have not found. 
ECC.7.29	Only this have I discovered: God made mankind upright, but they went seeking after many schemes.”
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise person? Who knows the meaning of a matter? A person’s wisdom makes his face shine, transforming the harshness of his face. 
ECC.8.2	I say: “Obey the king’s command, and especially in regard to the oath of God. 
ECC.8.3	Do not be hasty to rush out of his presence. Do not stand up for an evil cause, because he will do whatever he desires. 
ECC.8.4	Since the word of a king has authority, who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ 
ECC.8.5	Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm, and a wise person’s heart discerns the proper time and procedure. 
ECC.8.6	For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person’s trouble is heavy upon him. 
ECC.8.7	Since no one knows what will be, who can tell when it will happen? 
ECC.8.8	No one has authority over the wind to restrain it, nor authority over the day of death. As no one is discharged during a battle, so wickedness cannot rescue its master. 
ECC.8.9	I have seen all this while applying my mind to everything done under the sun: sometimes one person dominates another person to his own harm. 
ECC.8.10	Then I saw the wicked buried—they used to come and go from the holy place, but will soon be forgotten in the very city where they did this. This too is meaningless. 
ECC.8.11	When the sentence against a crime is not swiftly carried out, the human heart is encouraged to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and prolong his days, yet I know that it will be well for those who fear God, for those who revere Him. 
ECC.8.13	But it will not go well with the wicked, and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God. 
ECC.8.14	There is another enigma that occurs upon the earth: there are righteous people who are requited according to the work of the wicked, and there are wicked people who are requited according to the work of the righteous. I said, “This also is meaningless.” 
ECC.8.15	So I recommend enjoyment, because there is nothing better for humanity under the sun except to eat, drink and enjoy it. So this joy will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life that God gives him under the sun. 
ECC.8.16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to observe the activity that is done upon the earth (his eyes not seeing sleep either day or night), 
ECC.8.17	then I saw all the work of God. No one can comprehend the work that is done under the sun. Despite all human efforts to seek it out, no one comprehends. Even if a wise person claims to know, he cannot really comprehend. 
ECC.9.1	For all this I laid on my heart and to ascertain all this: that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works are in the hand of God. Whether love or hatred, no one knows—everything awaits them. 
ECC.9.2	Everyone shares the same destiny: for the righteous and the wicked; for the good, the ritually clean and the defiled; for one who sacrifices and one who does not sacrifice; as the good person so the sinner; as the one who swears like the one who fears an oath. 
ECC.9.3	This is a misery in everything done under the sun: that the same destiny awaits everyone. Moreover, the hearts of all humans are full of evil, and folly is in their hearts during their lives—after that they die. 
ECC.9.4	Everyone who is among the living has hope—even a living dog is better off than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, even the memory of them is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Their love, their hatred, and their zeal have already perished; never again will they have a share in anything that is done under the sun. 
ECC.9.7	Go! Eat your bread with gladness and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already accepted your deeds. 
ECC.9.8	Let your clothes always be white, and do not spare oil on your head. 
ECC.9.9	Live joyously with the wife whom you love all the days of your fleeting life that He has given you under the sun during all your fleeting days—for this is your portion in life and in your toil that you labor under the sun. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your strength, for there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom in 
ECC.9.11	I further observed under the sun: The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the mighty, nor does bread come to the wise, or wealth to the discerning, or favor to the skillful; for time and chance befall them all. 
ECC.9.12	Moreover, no man knows his time: like fish caught in a fatal net or birds caught in a snare, so people are trapped in a time of calamity, that falls upon them suddenly. 
ECC.9.13	I also observed this as wisdom under the sun, and it greatly impressed me. 
ECC.9.14	There was a little city with a few people in it and a mighty king came against it, surrounded it, and built great siege works against it. 
ECC.9.15	Now a poor, wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his shrewdness. Yet nobody remembered that poor man! 
ECC.9.16	So I said: “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised and his words are not heeded. 
ECC.9.17	The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than a ruler’s shout among fools. 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good. 
ECC.10.1	Dead flies make a perfumer’s oil stink, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 
ECC.10.2	The heart of the wise is to his right, and the heart of the fool is to his left. 
ECC.10.3	Even as the fool walks along the way, his heart lacks sense and tells everyone what a fool he is. 
ECC.10.4	If a ruler’s spirit rises up against you, do not leave your post, for composure allays great offences. 
ECC.10.5	There is a wrong I have seen under the sun like an error proceeding from a ruler. 
ECC.10.6	Fools are placed in many high positions, while the rich sit in low ones. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves. 
ECC.10.8	Whoever digs a pit may fall into it, and whoever breaks through a fence may be bitten by a snake. 
ECC.10.9	Whoever quarries stones may be hurt by them, and whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. 
ECC.10.10	If the iron axe is blunt and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must exert more force. So wisdom has the advantage of giving success. 
ECC.10.11	If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer. 
ECC.10.12	Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but the lips of a fool destroy him. 
ECC.10.13	The words from his mouth begin as folly and end as grievous madness— 
ECC.10.14	and the fool multiplies words. No one knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will happen after him? 
ECC.10.15	The mischief of fools wearies them for he doesn’t know how to go to town. 
ECC.10.16	 to you, O land, when your king is a youth and your princes feast in the morning. 
ECC.10.17	Happy are you, O land, when your king is a son of nobles, and your princes eat at the proper time— in self-control and not in drunkenness! 
ECC.10.18	By laziness the rafters sag, and by idle hands the house leaks. 
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life glad— but money is the answer for everything. 
ECC.10.20	Do not ridicule the king— even in your thoughts, nor curse the rich in your bedroom. For a bird of the air may carry your voice, and a winged creature may report your words.
ECC.11.1	Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it. 
ECC.11.2	Give portions to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what disaster may happen upon the earth. 
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full, they empty out rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to south or north, the tree lies wherever it falls. 
ECC.11.4	Whoever keeps watching the wind will not sow and whoever gazes at the clouds will not reap. 
ECC.11.5	Just as you do not know how the spirit passes into the bones in the womb of a pregnant woman, so you do not know the work of God who makes all things. 
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not let your hand be idle, for you do not know if this or that will succeed, or if both will prosper together. 
ECC.11.7	Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun. 
ECC.11.8	For if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all. But let him remember the days of darkness— for there will be many. Everything to come is obscure. 
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, young man, in your childhood, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment. 
ECC.11.10	So banish anxiety from your heart and cast off distress from your body, for youth and prime of life are fleeting.
ECC.12.1	So remember your Creator in the days of your youth: before the days of misery come, and years draw near when you will say: “I have no pleasure in them”— 
ECC.12.2	before the sun and light and moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds dissipate after the rain, 
ECC.12.3	in the day the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when grinders stop because they are few, and those peering out windows grow dim,

EST.1.1	This is what happened in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia. 
EST.1.2	At that time King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in the castle in Shushan. 
EST.1.3	In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his princes and his servants. The military leaders of Persia and Media plus the nobles and officials of the provinces were present. 
EST.1.4	He displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty for many days, 180 days. 
EST.1.5	When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the garden court of the king’s palace for all the people who were present in the palace at Shushan, for both the greatest to the least. 
EST.1.6	There were white and blue linen curtains hung by cords of fine linen and purple on silver rings and marble columns, gold and silver couches on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, marble, mother-of-pearl and minerals. 
EST.1.7	Wine was served in golden goblets, each of which was different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant according to the king’s wealth. 
EST.1.8	In keeping with the law, there were no restrictions on drinking for the king had instructed the supervisors of his household to comply with each person’s desire. 
EST.1.9	In addition Queen Vashti held a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry from the wine, he commanded Mehuman, Bizzetha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas—the seven eunuchs who attended Ahasuerus the king—
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king wearing the royal crown. He wanted to show the peoples and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive. 
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command conveyed by the eunuchs. Then the king became furious, and burned with anger. 
EST.1.13	So the king consulted the wise men who discerned the times, for it was the king’s practice to consult experts in matters of law and justice. 
EST.1.14	Those closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king’s presence and were the highest in the kingdom. 
EST.1.15	“By law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, for failing to obey the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed by the eunuchs?” 
EST.1.16	Then Memucan answered in the presence of the king and the princes: “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but also all the princes and peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.17	For the queen’s conduct will go out to all the women making their husbands contemptible in their eyes, by saying, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she would not come!’ 
EST.1.18	This very day the noblewomen of Persia and Media who have heard of the matter concerning the queen will respond similarly to all the king’s princes and there will be no end to the contempt and anger. 
EST.1.19	If it pleases the king, let a royal commandment go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal status to another who is more worthy than she. 
EST.1.20	Then the king’s edict, which he will enact, will be proclaimed throughout all his vast kingdom, and all the wives will give their husbands honor from the greatest to the smallest.” 
EST.1.21	The matter pleased the king and the princes. So the king did according to the word of Memucan. 
EST.1.22	He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script, and to each people in its own language, that every man should be in charge of his own household, and speak the language of his own people.
EST.2.1	After these things when King Ahasuerus’ anger subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s servants who attended him said: “Let a search be made on the king’s behalf for beautiful young virgins. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the palace at Shushan in the house of women under the supervision of Hegai the king’s eunuch, who oversees the women. Let them be given beauty treatments. 
EST.2.4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king become queen instead of Vashti.” This advice pleased the king and he acted accordingly. 
EST.2.5	There was a Jewish man in the Shushan palace whose name was Mordecai, son of Jair son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite, 
EST.2.6	who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with King Jeconiah of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken away. 
EST.2.7	He had raised Hadassah—that is Esther—his uncle’s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The girl was attractive and had a beautiful figure. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her to him as his own daughter. 
EST.2.8	After the king’s order and decree became known, many young women were assembled in the palace of Shushan under the supervision of Hegai. Esther also was taken into the king’s household under the supervision of Hegai, guardian of the women. 
EST.2.9	This young woman pleased him and found favor with him. He quickly arranged her beauty treatments and provided her special food. He also provided her with seven specially chosen young women from the king’s household. Then he moved her and her maids to the best place in the women’s house. 
EST.2.10	Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage, because Mordecai had commanded her not to make them known. 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai walked in front of the women’s courtyard to find out how Esther was, and what might happen to her. 
EST.2.12	When each young woman’s turn came to go to King Ahasuerus at the end of 12 months as prescribed for the women—for in this way they fulfilled their beautification: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and women’s cosmetics—
EST.2.13	the young woman would go to the king in this way: whatever she asked for was given to her to take with her from the women’s house to the king’s palace. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go, and in the morning she would return to the second women’s home under the supervision of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, guardian of the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her, and summoned her by name. 
EST.2.15	When the turn came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the women, advised. And Esther won favor in the eyes of all who saw her. 
EST.2.16	Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tevet, in the seventh year of his reign. 
EST.2.17	Now the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she won his grace and favor more than all the other virgins. So he placed the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his princes and servants. He proclaimed a holiday for the provinces and distributed gifts in keeping with the king’s wealth. 
EST.2.19	When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate. 
EST.2.20	Esther had not yet made known her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had told her. Esther continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.
EST.2.21	In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. 
EST.2.22	But Mordecai found out about the plot and told it to Queen Esther. Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name. 
EST.2.23	When the matter was investigated and found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows. It was then written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.
EST.3.1	Some time later King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, elevating him and setting his chair above all the officials who were with him. 
EST.3.2	All the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded it. But Mordecai would not bow down or pay him honor. 
EST.3.3	Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you disobeying the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	Day after day, they spoke to him but he would not listen to them. Therefore they told Haman in order to see whether Mordecai’s resolve would prevail, for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing down or paying him honor, Haman was filled with rage. 
EST.3.6	But it was repugnant in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him the identity of Mordecai’s people. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. 
EST.3.7	In the first month (that is the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast the pur (that is, ‘the lot’) in the presence of Haman from day to day and month to month, up to the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. 
EST.3.8	Haman then said to King Ahasuerus: “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of every other people and who do not obey the king’s laws. It is not in the king’s interest to tolerate them. 
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let an edict be written to destroy them. I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who carry out this business, to put it into the king’s treasuries.” 
EST.3.10	The king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman—son of Hammedatha the Agagite—enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	The king said to Haman, “The silver and the people are yours—do with them as you please.” 
EST.3.12	The king’s scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day, and an edict was written as Haman had commanded. Everything Haman commanded was written to the king’s provincial governors, and to the officials who were in every province, and to the officials of every people, province by province, according to its script and people by people according to its language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s ring. 
EST.3.13	Dispatches were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, stating to destroy, slay, and annihilate all the Jews—from the youth to the elderly, both little children and women—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions. 
EST.3.14	A copy of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to all people, so that they would be ready for that day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went out hurriedly with the king’s command and the edict was issued in the palace in Shushan. The king and Haman then sat down to drink. But the city of Shushan was dumbfounded.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned all that was done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the middle of the city crying out in a loud and bitter voice. 
EST.4.2	He went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one could enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	In each and every province where the king’s edict and law came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many put on sackcloth and ashes. 
EST.4.4	When Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, the queen was greatly distressed. She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on so he would remove his sackcloth, but he refused. 
EST.4.5	So Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to find the cause and reason for this. 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, even the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	He also gave him a written copy of the decree, which had been distributed in Shushan, for their annihilation, to show to Esther and to explain it to her. He instructed her to go in to the king, to beg his favor and plead before him on behalf of her people. 
EST.4.9	Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him instructions for Mordecai: 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces fully understand that for anyone, man or woman, who approaches the king in the inner courtyard without being summoned, he has one law—that he be put to death, unless the king extends his golden scepter permitting him to live. But I have not been summoned to come to the king for 30 days.” 
EST.4.12	So they conveyed Esther’s words to Mordecai. 
EST.4.13	Mordecai told them to reply to Esther with this answer, “Do not think in your soul that you will escape in the king’s household more than all the Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place—but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows whether you have attained royal status for such a time as this?” 
EST.4.15	Esther sent this to reply to Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	“Go! Gather together all the Jews who are in Shushan and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast in the same way. Afterwards, I will go in to the king, even though it is not according to the law. So if I perish, I perish!” 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai left and did all that Esther commanded him.
EST.5.1	On the third day, Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she found favor in his eyes, so the king held out to Esther the golden scepter in his hand and Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 
EST.5.3	Then said the king to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever you request, even as much as half of the kingdom, it will be given to you.” 
EST.5.4	So Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.” 
EST.5.5	The king replied, “Bring Haman quickly so we may do what Esther said.” Then the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther prepared. 
EST.5.6	 As they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your request? It will be granted to you. Whatever you request, even as much as half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.” 
EST.5.7	Esther answered and said, “My petition and my request is this: 
EST.5.8	if I have found favor in the king’s eyes and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and my request, then let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them—and then I will do as the king requests.”
EST.5.9	Haman went out that day happy and in good spirits. However, when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, and he did not rise or tremble before him, Haman was filled with rage against Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. He sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 
EST.5.11	Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and how the king had promoted him and exalted him above the other officials and servants of the king. 
EST.5.12	Haman added, “And that’s not all! Queen Esther invited only me to accompany the king to a banquet that she prepared. And she has also invited me along with the king tomorrow. 
EST.5.13	Yet all this does not satisfy me, as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” 
EST.5.14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let them set up a gallows 50 cubits high, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go happily with the king to the banquet.” This idea delighted Haman and he ordered the gallows to be built. 
EST.6.1	That night sleep deserted the king, so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, be brought in and read before the king. 
EST.6.2	It was found recorded there that Mordecai had revealed that Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the door, had conspired to kill King Ahasuerus. 
EST.6.3	The king asked, “What honor or recognition has been shown to Mordecai for this?” The king’s servants that attended him replied, “Nothing has been done for him.” 
EST.6.4	The king said, “Who is in the courtyard?” Now Haman had just come into the outer court of the king’s palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 
EST.6.5	The king’s servants answered, “Haman is standing in the courtyard.” The king said, “Let him come in.” 
EST.6.6	When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for a man whom the king desires to honor?” Now Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king desire to honor rather than me?” 
EST.6.7	So Haman replied, “For the man whom the king desires to honor, 
EST.6.8	let them bring a royal robe that the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on his head. 
EST.6.9	Then let the robe and the horse be placed into the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them clothe the man whom the king desires to honor and parade him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming, ‘This is what is done for a man the king desires to honor!’” 
EST.6.10	The king said to Haman, “Go quickly! Take the robe and the horse, just as you suggested, for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate! Do not neglect anything that you recommended.” 
EST.6.11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, robed Mordecai, and paraded him through the city streets, proclaiming: “This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honor.” 
EST.6.12	Afterwards, Mordecai then returned to the king’s gate, but Haman rushed to his home, grief-stricken and with his head covered. 
EST.6.13	Haman recounted to his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom you have begun your downfall, is of Jewish descent, you won’t be able to stand against him. In fact, you will certainly fall before him!” 
EST.6.14	While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came and hurried Haman along to the banquet Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther, 
EST.7.2	and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king asked Esther again, “Whatever you request, even as much as half of the kingdom, it will be given to you.” 
EST.7.3	So Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor in the eyes of the king, and if it pleases the king, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare the life of my people—this is my request! 
EST.7.4	For we have been sold, I and my people, for destruction, slaughter and annihilation. If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for such distress would not be worth disturbing the king.” 
EST.7.5	King Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is the man that presumed to do this?” 
EST.7.6	Esther replied, “The man—the adversary and foe—is this wicked Haman!” Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 
EST.7.7	Enraged, the king got up from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. But Haman stayed behind to plead with Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king had determined a catastrophic end for him. 
EST.7.8	When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the same couch where Esther was. The king exclaimed, “Will he also assault the queen while she is with me in the palace?” As soon as these words came out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. 
EST.7.9	Harbonah, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “Look, a gallows fifty cubits high is standing next to Haman’s house. Haman himself made it for Mordecai, who spoke good on behalf of the king!” The king said, “Hang him on it!” 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s rage subsided. 
EST.8.1	That same day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Then Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had revealed how he was related to her. 
EST.8.2	The king took off his signet ring, which he had taken back from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther then appointed Mordecai over Haman’s estate. 
EST.8.3	Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She pleaded with him to stop the evil of Haman the Agagite and his plan that he had devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	Then the king extended the golden scepter to Esther, and she arose and stood before the king. 
EST.8.5	She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor before him and it seems right to the king, and if I am pleasing in his eyes, let an edict be written rescinding the dispatches devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are throughout the king’s provinces. 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure seeing the disaster that will fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my relatives?” 
EST.8.7	King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “I have decided to give Haman’s estate to Esther and had him hanged on the gallows, because he stretched out his hand against the Jews. 
EST.8.8	Now write in the king’s name on behalf of the Jews what seems good to you and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a decree that is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, cannot be revoked.” 
EST.8.9	So the king’s scribes were called at that time—on the 23rd day of the third month, the month of Sivan. It was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to all the Jews, as well as to the officials, governors and advisors of all the 127 provinces that stretch from India to Ethiopia. To each province it was written in its own script and in its own language, and also to the Jews in their own writing and language. 
EST.8.10	This decree was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed with the king’s ring, and sent on horseback by couriers who rode on the king’s horses specially bred for their speed. 
EST.8.11	The king granted the right for Jews in every city to assemble themselves and to protect themselves—to destroy, kill and annihilate any army of any people or province that might attack them and their women and children, and to plunder their possessions. 
EST.8.12	The day appointed for this in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar. 
EST.8.13	A copy of the written edict was distributed to every province and made known to the peoples of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
EST.8.14	The couriers that rode royal horses raced out, pressed on by the king’s command. The decree was also given out at the palace at Shushan. 
EST.8.15	Then Mordecai went out from the king’s presence in blue and white royal robes, with a large gold crown, and also a purple robe of fine linen.The city of Shushan shouted and rejoiced. 
EST.8.16	For the Jews there was light and gladness, joy and honor. 
EST.8.17	Throughout every province and throughout every city, wherever the king’s edict and his law went, the Jews had gladness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many peoples of the land became Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them.
EST.9.1	Consequently, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is the month Adar), the king’s edict and his law drew near to be carried out. On that day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but contrary to expectations the Jews gained the upper hand over those that hated them. 
EST.9.2	Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus in order to lay hands on those seeking their harm. No one was able to stand against them, for fear of them had fallen on all the peoples. 
EST.9.3	Even all the administrators of the provinces, the officers and governors, and those doing business for the king, helped the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
EST.9.4	Mordecai was prominent at the palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces. The man Mordecai was growing ever more powerful. 
EST.9.5	The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying, and they did whatever they wished to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	In the citadel at Shushan the Jews killed and destroyed 500 people, 
EST.9.7	including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the 10 sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. They slew them but did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those that were killed in the citadel at Shushan was brought to the king’s attention. 
EST.9.12	Then the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men in the citadel of Shushan, including Haman’s ten sons. What have they done, in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your request? It shall be granted to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done.” 
EST.9.13	“If it please the king,” Esther said, “let the Jews in Shushan be allowed to carry out today’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.” 
EST.9.14	The king commanded that this be done. A decree was issued in Shushan and they hanged Haman’s 10 sons. 
EST.9.15	The Jews in Shushan gathered together on the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and they killed 300 men in Shushan, but they did not put their hands on the plunder. 
EST.9.16	Meanwhile the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered together to protect themselves and to get relief from their enemies. They killed 75,000 of their enemies, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
EST.9.17	This happened on the thirteenth day of Adar and on the fourteenth day they rested, making it a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.18	But the Jews that were in Shushan had assembled on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth they rested, making it a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.19	That is why the rural Jews—those living in unwalled villages—make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a day of sending presents of food to one another. 
EST.9.20	Mordecai recorded these events and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	urging them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar every year 
EST.9.22	as the days when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into celebration. These were to be days of feasting, celebration and sending presents of food to one another and giving gifts to the poor. 
EST.9.23	So the Jews agreed to continue the commemoration they had begun, and do what Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	For Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur—that is, the lot—to ruin and destroy them. 
EST.9.25	But when it came to the king’s attention, he issued a written edict that the wicked scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. (
EST.9.26	For this reason, these days were called Purim, from the word pur.) Therefore because of everything in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews established and took upon themselves, upon their descendants, and upon all who joined with them, that they would commemorate these two days in the way prescribed and at the appointed time every year. 
EST.9.28	These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family and in every province and every city. These days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor their remembrance perish from their descendants. 
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail, and also Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
EST.9.30	He sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of 
EST.9.31	to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them and just as they had established for themselves and their descendants, matters regarding their times of fasting and lamentations. 
EST.9.32	Esther’s command confirmed these regulations about Purim and it was written into the records.
EST.10.1	Now King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute upon the entire land, even to the coastlands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	All the acts of his power and might, along with the full account of the greatness of Mordecai and the story of how the king promoted him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by the multitude of his people. He sought their good and spoke for the welfare of his descendants. 
DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	God gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the House of God. He brought them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god and put the vessels into the treasure house of his god. 
DAN.1.3	Then the king told Ashpenaz the chief of his officials to bring in some of the sons of Israel from royal descent and nobility— 
DAN.1.4	youths without any defect, handsome, proficient in all wisdom, knowledgeable, intelligent and capable of serving in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. 
DAN.1.5	The king allotted them a daily portion from the king’s delicacies and from the wine that he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end they were to stand before the king. 
DAN.1.6	Now among them were some from the sons of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	The chief officer gave them new names: to Daniel, Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-nego. 
DAN.1.8	But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king’s delicacies or with the wine he was drinking, so he entreated the chief official for permission not to defile himself. 
DAN.1.9	Now God caused the chief official to show mercy and compassion to Daniel. 
DAN.1.10	But the chief official said to Daniel: “I fear my lord the king, who allotted your food and your drink. Why should he see your faces looking poorly, unlike the other youths your age? Then the king would have my head because of you.” 
DAN.1.11	Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Please test your servants for ten days, giving us just vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then compare our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king’s delicacies, and treat your servants according to what you see.” 
DAN.1.14	So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	At the end of ten days their appearance looked better and their bodies healthier than all the youths who ate the king’s food. 
DAN.1.16	So the guard took away their delicacies and the wine they were supposed to drink and gave them vegetables instead. 
DAN.1.17	Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and proficiency in every kind of wisdom and literature, and Daniel could understand all sorts of visions and dreams. 
DAN.1.18	At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them before Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	When the king spoke with them, he did not find among all of them anyone like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service. 
DAN.1.20	In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers throughout his realm. 
DAN.1.21	Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams. His spirit was troubled and sleep escaped him. 
DAN.2.2	So the king issued an order to summon the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers and Chaldeans in order to explain to the king his dreams. When they came and stood before the king, 
DAN.2.3	he said to them, “I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.” 
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic , “May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.” 
DAN.2.5	The king answered the Chaldeans saying, “I firmly decree: If you do not make the dream and its meaning known to me, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses reduced to rubble. 
DAN.2.6	But if you tell the dream and its meaning, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and its meaning!” 
DAN.2.7	They responded a second time, saying, “Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will declare the interpretation.” 
DAN.2.8	The king replied saying, “I know for sure that you are buying time since you see that I have firmly decreed 
DAN.2.9	that if you do not reveal the dream to me, there is only one verdict for you. You have conspired to say something false and fraudulent, until such a time as things might change. So then, tell me the dream and I will know that you can tell me its meaning.” 
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered the king saying, “There is no man on earth who can meet the king’s demand. For no great king, however great or mighty, has ever asked such a thing from any magician, astrologer or Chaldean. 
DAN.2.11	What the king asks is too difficult. There is no one who could declare it to the king, except the gods whose dwelling is not with mortals!” 
DAN.2.12	Because of this, the king became furiously angry and gave orders to execute all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went out that the wise men were about to be slaughtered. They also sought Daniel and his companions to execute them. 
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel spoke with tact and discretion to Arioch, who was captain of the king’s guard and who had set out to execute the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.15	He spoke up and said to Arioch, the king’s captain, “Why is the king’s decree so urgent?” Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter. 
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went in and asked the king to grant him time, so that he might disclose the interpretation to the king. 
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah about the matter 
DAN.2.18	so they would request mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not perish along with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.19	During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven 
DAN.2.20	and answered, saying: “Blessed be the Name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His. 
DAN.2.21	He changes times and seasons. He removes kings and installs kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. 
DAN.2.22	He reveals deep and hidden things. He knows what lies in darkness and light dwells with Him. 
DAN.2.23	To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise! For You gave me wisdom and power. You have made known to me what we asked of You. You revealed to us the word of the king.” 
DAN.2.24	Then Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king and I will declare the interpretation to the king.” 
DAN.2.25	So Arioch quickly ushered Daniel into the king’s presence and said to him, “I have found a man among the sons of the exiles from Judah, who can make known the interpretation to the king.” 
DAN.2.26	The king then asked Daniel (who was renamed Belteshazzar), “Are you able to reveal to me the dream that I saw, as well as its interpretation?” 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered the king, saying: “The mystery about which the king inquired is such that neither wise men, astrologers, magicians, or sorcerers can disclose it to the king. 
DAN.2.28	But, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar the things that will happen in the latter days. The dream and the visions that went through your head as you lay on your bed are these. 
DAN.2.29	“To you , O king—as you lay on your bed—came thoughts about what will come to pass in the future. The Revealer of mysteries has made known to you what is going to happen. 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this mystery is not revealed to me because I posses more wisdom than any other living person, but in order that the king may know the interpretation and understand the thoughts of your heart.
DAN.2.31	“You looked, O king, and behold, there before you stood a huge statue—an enormous and dazzling image, whose appearance was awesome. 
DAN.2.32	The head of that statue was of pure gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, and its feet partly iron and partly clay. 
DAN.2.34	While you were watching, a stone was cut out, but not by hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from summer threshing-floors that the wind blows away. Not a trace of them could be found. Then the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. 
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation. 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, are the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, might and glory. 
DAN.2.38	Wherever mankind, beasts of the field, and fowls of the heaven dwell, He has given them into your hand, and made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold. 
DAN.2.39	“Now after you another kingdom will arise, one inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over all the earth. 
DAN.2.40	Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron shatters and breaks everything—and just as iron smashes everything, so will it shatter and crush all the others. 
DAN.2.41	Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly potter’s clay and partly iron, so this will be a divided kingdom. It will have some of the strength of the iron, for you saw the iron mixed with clay. 
DAN.2.42	As the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. 
DAN.2.43	Just as you saw iron mixed with clay, people will mix with one another, but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. 
DAN.2.44	“Now in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will this kingdom be left to another people. It will crush and bring to an end all of these kingdoms. But it will endure forever. 
DAN.2.45	For just as you saw a stone cut out of a mountain, yet not by hands, crush the iron, bronze, clay, silver and gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen in the future. Now the dream is certain, and its interpretation is trustworthy.” 
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel and gave orders that an offering and incense be provided for him. 
DAN.2.47	In response the king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and the revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this secret!” 
DAN.2.48	Then the king promoted Daniel and lavished on him many marvelous gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained at the royal court.
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
DAN.3.2	Then King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the authorities of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
DAN.3.3	Then the satraps, administrators, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the authorities of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “You are commanded O peoples, nations and languages, 
DAN.3.5	that when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Whoever does not fall down and worship will that same hour be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.” 
DAN.3.7	Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and pipes, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
DAN.3.8	At that time certain Chaldeans came forward and denounced the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They spoke up and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever! 
DAN.3.10	You, O king, made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, must fall down and worship the golden image, 
DAN.3.11	and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego—those men pay no heed to you, O king. They do not serve your gods, nor will they worship the golden image that you have set up.” 
DAN.3.13	Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar ordered Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to be summoned. When these men were brought before the king, 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar responded to them saying, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you don’t serve my gods or worship the golden image that I set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and pipes and all kinds of music you must fall down and worship the image that I have made. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire! Then what god will be able to deliver you out of my hands?” 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king saying, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to answer you concerning this matter. 
DAN.3.17	If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to save us from the furnace of blazing fire and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king. 
DAN.3.18	Yet even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image that you set up.” 
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage and the appearance of his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than it was normally heated 
DAN.3.20	and commanded some of the mighty men in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego and to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.21	So these men, wearing their robes, tunics, hats and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.22	But because the king’s order was so urgent and the furnace so extremely hot, a raging flame killed those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. 
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell bound into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and leapt to his feet. He asked his ministers, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire?” They replied to the king, “Surely, O king.” 
DAN.3.25	But he answered saying, “Look! I see four men walking about unbound and unharmed in the middle of the fire, and the fourth has the appearance like a son of the gods!” 
DAN.3.26	Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and exclaimed, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out from the middle of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	When the satraps, administrators, governors and royal ministers had gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men. Not a hair of their head was singed, nor were their robes scorched, nor was there a smell of fire on them. 
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him! They defied the king’s edict and gave up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I hereby decree that any people, nation or language that says anything slanderous against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego will be torn limb from limb and their house made a pile of rubble, because there is no other god that is able to deliver in this way.” 
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.
DAN.3.31	King Nebuchadnezzar— To all peoples, nations and languages who dwell in all the earth: May your peace abound! 
DAN.3.32	It seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders that God Most High has done for me. 
DAN.3.33	How great are His signs, how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, His dominion from generation to generation.
DAN.4.1	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace. 
DAN.4.2	I had a dream that frightened me. While on my bed the images and visions in my mind terrified me. 
DAN.4.3	So I issued a decree to bring all the wise men of Babylon before me so that they could make known to me the meaning of the dream. 
DAN.4.4	When the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans and diviners came in, I recounted the dream to them, but they were unable to make known its interpretation to me. 
DAN.4.5	Finally Daniel—whose name was Belteshazzar after the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods—came in before me and I told him the dream. 
DAN.4.6	I said, “Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery baffles you. Consider my dream that I have seen and tell me its interpretation. 
DAN.4.7	“These are the visions in my head while I was on my bed: I looked, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth. Its height was enormous. 
DAN.4.8	The tree grew large and became strong and its top reached to heaven; it was visible to the ends of the earth. 
DAN.4.9	Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Beneath it the beasts of the field found shade and birds of the sky lived in its branches, and from it all creatures were fed. 
DAN.4.10	“I was watching the visions in my mind while on my bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, descended from heaven. 
DAN.4.11	He called loudly, saying: ‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Let beasts flee from under it, and birds from its branches. 
DAN.4.12	Yet leave a stump with its roots in the earth, in fetters of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be damp with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth. 
DAN.4.13	Let his mind be altered from that of a man and let an animal’s mind be given to him and let seven periods of time pass over him. 
DAN.4.14	This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, this verdict by the command of the holy ones, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over the realm of man and bestows it to whomever He wishes, and may set over them even the lowliest of men.’ 
DAN.4.15	“I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw this dream. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its meaning, for none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to make known to me its interpretation. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
DAN.4.16	Then Daniel, whose name is also Belteshazzar, was perplexed for a brief time; his thoughts alarmed him. The king answered, and said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or the interpretation disturb you.” But Belteshazzar replied, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies! 
DAN.4.17	The tree that you saw grow large and strong, whose top reached to heaven and that was visible to all the earth, 
DAN.4.18	whose leaves were beautiful and whose fruit was so abundant that there was food for all in it and beneath which the beasts of the fields lived and in its branches birds of the sky dwelt—
DAN.4.19	it is you, O king! For you have grown great and mighty. Your greatness reaches to heaven, and your authority extends to the end of the earth. 
DAN.4.20	“‘You, O king, saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it! Yet leave a stump with its roots in the ground, in fetters of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, until seven time periods pass over him.’ 
DAN.4.21	“This is the interpretation, O king. It is the decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king: 
DAN.4.22	“You will be driven away from people and will dwell with the wild animals. You will feed on grass like an ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven periods of time will pass over you until you know that the Most High is sovereign over the realm of mankind and gives it to whomever He wishes. 
DAN.4.23	“The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you understand that Heaven is sovereign. 
DAN.4.24	Therefore, O king, may my counsel be acceptable to you: Renounce your sins through righteousness and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged.”
DAN.4.25	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.26	At the end of twelve months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, 
DAN.4.27	the king exclaimed, “Is this not the great Babylon that I have built as the royal residence by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?” 
DAN.4.28	The words were still in the king’s mouth when a voice fell from heaven. “King Nebuchadnezzar, it has been decreed to you that your kingdom has been removed from you! 
DAN.4.29	You will be driven away from men and you will live with the beasts of the field. You will feed on grass like an ox and seven periods of time will pass over you until you come to know that the Most High is sovereign over the realm of mankind and gives it to whomever He wishes.” 
DAN.4.30	Immediately the word about Ne­buchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from men, ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws. 
DAN.4.31	But at the end of the appointed days, I Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes up to heaven and my sanity returned to me. So I blessed the Most High and I praised and honored Him who lives forever. “For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endures from generation to generation! 
DAN.4.32	All the inhabitants of earth are counted as nothing. He does as He wills with the army of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. No one can hold back His hand, or say to Him, ‘What have you done?’ 
DAN.4.33	“At that moment my sanity returned to me, and my majesty and my splendor were restored to me, for the glory of my kingdom. My ministers and nobles sought me out and I was reestablished over my kingdom. I became even greater than before. 
DAN.4.34	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, because all His works are right and His ways just. He is able to humble those who walk in pride.”
DAN.5.1	King Belshazzar held a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles and was drinking wine in front of the thousand. 
DAN.5.2	When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he issued an order to bring in the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the Temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his consorts and his concubines could drink from them. 
DAN.5.3	So they brought the gold vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the House of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, consorts and concubines drank from them. 
DAN.5.4	They drank the wine and praised the gods made of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone. 
DAN.5.5	At that very moment, the fingers of a human hand emerged and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace opposite the lampstand, so that the king could see the back of the hand that was writing. 
DAN.5.6	The color drained from the king’s face, his thoughts alarmed him, his hips gave way and his knees began knocking together. 
DAN.5.7	The king called loudly to summon the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the diviners. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain around his neck, and will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom!” 
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription nor tell the king what it meant. 
DAN.5.9	So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew pale. His nobles were baffled. 
DAN.5.10	The queen hearing the words of the king and his nobles entered the banquet hall. The queen spoke out and said, “May the king live forever! Do not let your thoughts frighten you, or your face be so pale! 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your father, he was found to have insight and intelligence, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. So King Nebuchadnezzar your father made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans and diviners. 
DAN.5.12	This man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight for interpreting dreams, explaining riddles, and solving problems. Now, let Daniel be summoned and he will explain the interpretation.” 
DAN.5.13	So Daniel was brought before the king and the king said to Daniel, “Are you Daniel who is one of the captives of Judah that my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard about you, how a spirit of the gods is in you and how there has been found in you insight, discernment and extraordinary wisdom. 
DAN.5.15	Just now the wise men and diviners were brought before me to read this writing and to make its meaning known to me, but they are unable to declare its interpretation. 
DAN.5.16	However, I have heard about you that you are able to provide interpretations and to solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the writing and explain to me its meaning, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain around your neck and have the authority to rule as the third in the kingdom.” 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered the king saying, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and tell him its meaning. 
DAN.5.18	Your majesty, God Most High gave your father Nebuchadnezzar the kingdom, as well as greatness, glory, and splendor. 
DAN.5.19	Because of the grandeur that He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and languages dreaded and feared him. He killed whomever he wanted and spared anyone he wanted; he raised up whomever he wished and humbled anyone he wished. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart became haughty and his spirit hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. 
DAN.5.21	He was driven away from among men and his mind became like an animal, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he fed on grass like an ox, and his body was damp with the dew of heaven until he recognized that God Most High is sovereign over the realm of mankind and that He sets up over it whomever He wills. 
DAN.5.22	“But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this. 
DAN.5.23	Instead you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. You had the vessels of His House brought before you, and you and your nobles, your consorts and your concubines have been drinking wine in them. You have praised the gods made of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. Yet you did not honor the God who holds in His hand your very breath and all your ways. 
DAN.5.24	Therefore, the hand was sent from Him that wrote this inscription. 
DAN.5.25	“Now this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPARSIN. 
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the inscription: MENE: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. 
DAN.5.27	TEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting. 
DAN.5.28	PERES: Your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.” 
DAN.5.29	Then at Belshazzar’s command, they clothed Daniel with purple, put a chain of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation about him that he would have the authority as third ruler in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.30	On that very night King Belshazzar of the Chaldeans was slain. 
DAN.6.1	So Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of 62. 
DAN.6.2	It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the whole kingdom 
DAN.6.3	with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. These satraps were accountable to them so that the king would not be troubled. 
DAN.6.4	Now this Daniel was distinguishing himself among the supervisors and satraps because he had an extraordinary spirit in him. In fact, the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom. 
DAN.6.5	At this time the supervisors and satraps tried to find ground for a charge against Daniel regarding the kingdom. But they were unable to find fault or corruption, because he was trustworthy and no negligence or dishonesty could be found in him. 
DAN.6.6	Finally these men said, “We’re not going to find any basis for charges against this man Daniel, unless we find something against him regarding the law of his God.” 
DAN.6.7	So these supervisors and satraps went in to the king as a group, and said to him, “King Darius, live forever! 
DAN.6.8	All the supervisors of the realm, the magistrates and satraps, ministers and governors, have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce a decree that anyone who prays to any god or man for 30 days other than you O king, will be cast into the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.9	Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it may not be altered, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” 
DAN.6.10	Thereupon King Darius issued the written decree. 
DAN.6.11	Now when Daniel learned that a written decree had been issued, he went into his house, where the windows in his upper room opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he knelt down, prayed and gave thanks before his God, just as he did before. 
DAN.6.12	Then these men came as a group and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 
DAN.6.13	So they approached the king and spoke to him about the royal decree: “Didn’t you issue a written decree that anyone who prays to any god or man for 30 days—except for you, O king—shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king replied, “The decree stands, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” 
DAN.6.14	Then they answered and said to the king: “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree that you put in writing. He still prays three times a day!” 
DAN.6.15	When the king heard this report, he was deeply distressed, and he set his mind on how he might rescue Daniel. Until sunset he struggled to find a way to save him. 
DAN.6.16	Then these men came as a throng in to the king, and said to the king: “Remember, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or edict which the king issues may be altered.” 
DAN.6.17	So the king gave the order and Daniel was brought and thrown into the lions’ den. Now the king spoke to Daniel saying, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!” 
DAN.6.18	A stone was brought to block the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet of his nobles, so that nothing could be changed regarding Daniel. 
DAN.6.19	Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting—no entertainment was brought before him. He was unable to sleep. 
DAN.6.20	At dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.21	As he reached the den, he cried out to Daniel with a voice of anguish. The king spoke out to Daniel saying: “Daniel, servant of the living God, was your God, whom you serve continually, able to rescue you from the lions?” 
DAN.6.22	Daniel spoke to the king: “May the king live forever! 
DAN.6.23	My God sent His angel to shut the lions’ mouths so that they haven’t harmed me, because I was found innocent before Him. Nor have I committed any crime against you, O king.” 
DAN.6.24	Then the king was overjoyed, and ordered Daniel taken up out of the den. So Daniel was lifted out of the pit. No injury of any kind was found on him because he had trusted in his God. 
DAN.6.25	At the king’s command, those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions’ den—they, their children, and their wives. They had not even reached the bottom of the pit before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones. 
DAN.6.26	Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages dwelling in all the earth: “May your peace be abundant! 
DAN.6.27	I issue a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom people are to tremble with fear before the God of Daniel. “For He is the living God, enduring forever! His kingdom will never be destroyed, His dominion will never end. 
DAN.6.28	He delivers and rescues. He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth. He has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions!” 
DAN.6.29	So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was on his bed. He wrote down a summary of the dream. 
DAN.7.2	Daniel said: “I was looking in my vision at night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were churning up the great sea. 
DAN.7.3	Four huge beasts came up from the sea, each different from the others. 
DAN.7.4	“The first was like a lion with eagle’s wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off and it was lifted off the ground. It was made to stand upon two feet like a man, and the heart of a human was given to it. 
DAN.7.5	“And behold there before me was another beast, a second one, like a bear. It raised itself up on one side; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh!’ 
DAN.7.6	“After that I looked, and behold, there was another one like a leopard. On its back it had four wings like those of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. 
DAN.7.7	“After this in my vision at night, I looked and behold there was a fourth beast—terrifying, frightening, tremendously strong, with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed—and anything that was left it trampled with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it; it had ten horns. 
DAN.7.8	“While I was pondering the horns, behold, another horn, a small one, sprang up between them, and three of the first horns were uprooted from before it. And behold, this horn had eyes resembling human eyes and a mouth speaking boastfully.
DAN.7.9	“While I was watching, thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His garment was as white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, its wheels a burning fire. 
DAN.7.10	A river of fire was flowing and coming out from before Him. Thousands of thousands attended Him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. 
DAN.7.11	“I kept watching because of the boastful words that the horn was speaking. I continued watching until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. 
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion had been taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 
DAN.7.13	“I was watching in the night visions. Behold, One like a Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days, and was brought into His presence. 
DAN.7.14	Dominion, glory and sovereignty were given to Him that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will never pass away, and His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was disturbed within me, and the visions of my head alarmed me. 
DAN.7.16	I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he spoke with me and revealed the interpretation of these things: 
DAN.7.17	‘These large beasts, four in number, are four kings that will rise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the 
DAN.7.19	“Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast that was different from all the others, exceedingly terrifying with iron teeth and bronze claws, which broke in pieces and devoured and then stomped with its feet anything that remained. 
DAN.7.20	Of the ten horns on its head, the other horn that sprang up before which three others fell—that horn eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things, and its appearance was more imposing than its companions. 
DAN.7.21	As I was watching, that horn was waging war against the 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was rendered in favor of the 
DAN.7.23	“Thus he explained: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth that will be different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, and trample it and crush it. 
DAN.7.24	As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise. Another will arise after them, but he will be different from the previous ones; he will subdue three kings. 
DAN.7.25	He will speak words against the Most High, and will continually harass the 
DAN.7.26	But the court will sit and he will be stripped of his power to be destroyed and abolished for all time. 
DAN.7.27	Then the kingdom, power, and greatness of the kingdoms under all heaven will be given to the people of the 
DAN.7.28	This is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me and the color drained from my face. But I kept the matter in my heart.”
DAN.8.1	“In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me earlier. 
DAN.8.2	In the vision I saw myself in the citadel of Shushan , which is in the province of Elam. In the vision I saw that I was beside the Ulai Canal. 
DAN.8.3	I lifted up my eyes and looked up, behold, a ram with two horns was standing in front of the canal. The two horns were long but one was longer than the other, but the longer one grew up last. 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram charging toward the west and north and south. No animal could stand against him—none could deliver from his hand. So he did as he pleased and magnified himself. 
DAN.8.5	“While I was contemplating this, behold, a male goat came from the west crossing the face of the whole earth without touching the ground! Now the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 
DAN.8.6	He came up to the two-horn ram that I had seen standing beside the canal, and charged it with raging strength. 
DAN.8.7	I saw him attacking the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. Now the ram was not strong enough to stand against him, so he knocked the ram to the ground and trampled him. No one could rescue the ram from his power. 
DAN.8.8	“The male goat became exceedingly great, but as soon as he became mighty, the large horn was broken, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven. 
DAN.8.9	“Out of one of them came forth a small horn, which grew extremely large to the south and the east, and toward the beautiful land. 
DAN.8.10	It grew as high as the host of heaven and hurled some of the host and the stars down to the earth and trampled them. 
DAN.8.11	It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host. It took away from him the daily offering and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down. 
DAN.8.12	The host was given over along with the daily sacrifice, in the course of its rebellion. It will hurl truth to the ground and prosper in what it does. 
DAN.8.13	“Then I heard a holy one speaking and another holy one said to the one who was speaking, ‘How long will the vision last, the daily sacrifice be forsaken because of rebellion, the sanctuary be surrendered and the host be trampled?’ 
DAN.8.14	Then he said to me: ‘For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be vindicated.’
DAN.8.15	“Now it happened that while I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, behold, standing before me was one with the appearance of a man. 
DAN.8.16	Then I heard a human voice coming from between the banks of the Ulai, calling out saying, ‘Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.’ 
DAN.8.17	“He came near to where I was standing, and as he approached I was terrified and fell on my face. But he said to me, ‘Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.’ 
DAN.8.18	“While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and stood me up, 
DAN.8.19	and said: ‘Behold, I am going to inform you about what will happen later in the time of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end. 
DAN.8.20	The ram that you saw with the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	The buck, the male goat, is the king of Greece; and the large horn between his eyes is the first king. 
DAN.8.22	The four horns that replaced the one that was broken represent four kingdoms that will arise from this nation, though not with its power. 
DAN.8.23	“‘Now toward the end of their reign, when the measure of transgressions is completed, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise. 
DAN.8.24	His power will be mighty, but it will not be by his strength alone. He will cause extraordinary devastation, and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy both the powerful and the holy people. 
DAN.8.25	By his cunning he will cause deceit to prosper under his hand and he will consider himself superior. He will destroy many, taking them unaware. He will even stand up against the Prince of princes, yet he will be broken, but not by human hands. 
DAN.8.26	“‘Now the vision of the evenings and mornings that has been told to you is true, but seal up the vision for it concerns many days from now.’ 
DAN.8.27	“Then I, Daniel, was stricken and languished for days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business, but I was astounded at the vision and no one could explain it.
DAN.9.1	“In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign—I, Daniel, understood from the books that according to the word of 
DAN.9.3	So I set my face to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes. 
DAN.9.4	“I prayed to 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have acted wickedly; we have rebelled; we have turned away from Your 
DAN.9.6	We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our leaders and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
DAN.9.7	“‘You Lord are righteousness, but shame covers our face to this day—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far, in all the countries where you have banished them—because they behaved unfaithfully toward you. 
DAN.9.8	, shame covers our face—our kings, our leaders, our fathers—because we have sinned against you. 
DAN.9.9	The Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against Him. 
DAN.9.10	We have not obeyed the voice of 
DAN.9.11	Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your 
DAN.9.12	So He has confirmed His words that he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled over us by bringing on us a great calamity. Under the whole heaven nothing like this has ever been done to Jerusalem! 
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the 
DAN.9.14	So 
DAN.9.15	“‘So now, 
DAN.9.16	Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, let Your anger and Your fury turn away, please, from Jerusalem, Your city, Your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become an object of scorn to all those around us. 
DAN.9.17	‘So now, our God, listen to the prayers and petitions of Your servant, and cause Your face to shine upon Your devastated Sanctuary, for the sake of my Lord. 
DAN.9.18	Give ear, my God, and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolation and the city called by Your name. We do not present our supplications before You because of our own righteousness, but because of Your great compassions. 
DAN.9.19	Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! For Your own sake, O my God, do not delay! For Your city and Your people are called by Your name.’ 
DAN.9.20	“While I was still speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before 
DAN.9.21	yes, while I was praying, Gabriel, the one I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me swiftly about the time of the evening offering. 
DAN.9.22	“He instructed me and said to me: ‘Daniel, I have come now to give you insight and understanding. 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your requests, a message went out, and I have come to declare it to you, for you are greatly esteemed. Therefore consider the message and understand the vision: 
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks are decreed concerning your people and your holy city, to put an end to transgression to bring sin to an end, to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. 
DAN.9.25	So know and understand: From the issuing of the decree to restore and to build Jerusalem until the time 
DAN.9.26	Then after the 62 weeks 
DAN.9.27	Then he will make a firm covenant with many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on a wing of abominations will come one who destroys, until the decreed annihilation is poured out on the one who destroys.’”
DAN.10.1	In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. The oracle was true and concerns a great war. He understood the message and gained insight through a vision. 
DAN.10.2	“In those days, I, Daniel was mourning for three whole weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no rich food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I anoint myself with oil, until the end of three weeks. 
DAN.10.4	“Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was beside the bank of the great river, the Tigris, 
DAN.10.5	I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a man dressed in linen with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. 
DAN.10.6	His body was like yellow jasper, his face like a flash of lightning, his eyes like fiery torches, his arms and his feet like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the roar of a multitude. 
DAN.10.7	“Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men that were with me did not see the vision. Nevertheless, such a great terror fell upon them that they fled and hid themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone to see this great vision. My strength drained from me and my vigor was destroyed; I could not summon any strength. 
DAN.10.9	Yet I heard the sound of his words. When I heard him speaking, I fell on my face in a deep sleep with my face to the ground. 
DAN.10.10	“Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. 
DAN.10.11	He said to me, ‘Daniel, highly valued man, carefully consider the words I am speaking to you. Stand up! For now I have been sent to you.’ When he spoke this word to me, I stood up trembling. 
DAN.10.12	“Then he said to me, ‘Don’t be afraid, Daniel! For from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come because of your words. 
DAN.10.13	However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me for 21 days, but behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I had been detained there with the kings of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future days. For the vision concerns days yet to come.’ 
DAN.10.15	“While he was speaking these words to me, I bowed my face toward the ground and was speechless. 
DAN.10.16	Then behold, one who resembled a human touched my lips. I opened my mouth and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, ‘O my Lord because of the vision, anguish has overcome me and I have no strength. 
DAN.10.17	For how can this servant of my Lord speak with my Lord since no strength remains in me and no spirit is left in me?’ 
DAN.10.18	“Again the one who looked like a man touched me and strengthened me. 
DAN.10.19	Then he said: ‘Highly valued man, do not fear! 
DAN.10.20	“Then he said: ‘Do you understand why I have come to you? Now I must return to fight against the prince of Persia! When I go, behold, the prince of Greece will come. 
DAN.10.21	But first, I will tell you what is recorded in the writing of truth.’ (No one strengthened me against these, except Michael your prince. 
DAN.11.1	“And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him). 
DAN.11.2	“Now I will declare the truth. Behold, three more kings will arise in Persia. Then a fourth will be far richer than all. When he becomes powerful through his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the realm of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great authority and do as he pleases. 
DAN.11.4	But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and distributed to the four winds of heaven—though it will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the authority he exercised, for his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others besides these. 
DAN.11.5	“Then the king of the south will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he, and he will rule a greater kingdom than his. 
DAN.11.6	After some years they will form an alliance. The daughter of the king of the south will approach the king of the north to make an agreement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will his strength endure. Instead she will be given up, together with her escort, her father and the one who supported her in those times. 
DAN.11.7	But another shoot from her roots will arise in his place. He will come against the army of the king of the north and enter his fortress. He will fight against them and prevail. 
DAN.11.8	He will also carry off their gods into captivity to Egypt, along with their metal images and their precious articles of silver and gold. For a few years he will stay away from the king of the north. 
DAN.11.9	“Then the king of the north will invade the realm of the king of the south, but he will retreat to his own land. 
DAN.11.10	His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will advance and overflow and sweep through like a flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress. 
DAN.11.11	“Then the king of the south, enraged, will march out and fight against the king of the north, who will also muster a massive army. But the army will be defeated. 
DAN.11.12	But when the army is carried off, the heart of the king of the south will become arrogant, and will slaughter thousands and thousands, yet he will not prevail. 
DAN.11.13	The king of the north will raise up another army, one greater than the first. After an interval of some years, he will advance with a great army and with abundant supplies. 
DAN.11.14	“In those times many will rise up against the king of the south. The lawless sons among your own people will raise themselves up in order to confirm the vision, but they will stumble. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the north will come, build a siege-ramp and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the south will not prevail—not even their select troops will have strength to prevail. 
DAN.11.16	But the invader will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to stand against him. He will take his stand in the beautiful land and its devastation in his hand. 
DAN.11.17	His intention will be to come with the strength of his entire kingdom, but he will reach an agreement with him. He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to destroy the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him. 
DAN.11.18	Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put an end to his insolence and pay him back for his insolence. 
DAN.11.19	He will then turn his face toward the strongholds of his own land, but he will stumble and fall, not to be found again. 
DAN.11.20	“In his place will arise one who will dispatch a tax collector to extract tribute for royal glory, but within a few days he will be destroyed, though not in anger or battle. 
DAN.11.21	“Then in his place will arise a despicable person, on whom royal honor has not been conferred. He will come in a time of tranquility, and seize the kingdom through intrigue. 
DAN.11.22	Armies will be utterly swept away from before him and will be broken, as well as the leader of the covenant. 
DAN.11.23	After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully; he will rise to power with a small force. 
DAN.11.24	Without warning, he will invade the richest province and accomplish what his fathers or predecessors were unable to do. He will lavish on them plunder, loot and spoils. He will plot the overthrow of strongholds, though only for a while. 
DAN.11.25	“He will summon his strength and courage against the king of the south with a great army. The king of the south will wage war with a very large and mighty army, but he will not succeed because of plots devised against him. 
DAN.11.26	Those who eat his delicacies will destroy him, and his army will be swept away; many will be slain in battle. 
DAN.11.27	These two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and speak lies, but to no avail, for the end will still come at the appointed time. 
DAN.11.28	The king of the north will return to his own land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action and then return to his own land. 
DAN.11.29	“At the appointed time he will invade the south again, only this time the outcome will not be as before. 
DAN.11.30	The ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his rage against the holy covenant. When he returns, he will favor those who forsake the holy covenant. 
DAN.11.31	“His forces will rise up and profane the fortified Temple; they will stop the daily offering and set up the abomination of desolation. 
DAN.11.32	With smooth words he will seduce those who act wickedly against the covenant, but the people who know their God will stand strong and prevail. 
DAN.11.33	Those who are wise among the people will instruct many, though for many days they will fall by the sword, or be burned, captured or pillaged. 
DAN.11.34	When they stumble, they will receive a little help, but many will join them deceitfully. 
DAN.11.35	Even some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end—for it will still come at the appointed time. 
DAN.11.36	“So the king will do as he pleases, exalting and magnifying himself above every god. He will even speak outrageous things against the God of gods. He will prosper until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been decided will be done. 
DAN.11.37	He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or the one desired by women, nor will he show regard for any god, but will exalt himself above all. 
DAN.11.38	Instead of these, he will honor a god of fortresses—a god his fathers did not acknowledge he will honor with gold, silver, precious stones and costly things. 
DAN.11.39	He will attack strong fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will give them authority over many and will parcel out land for a price. 
DAN.11.40	“Now at the time of the end the king of the south will attack him, and the king of the north will storm out against him with chariots, horsemen and many ships. He will invade lands and pass through them like an overflowing river. 
DAN.11.41	He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many will be overthrown, but these will escape from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon. 
DAN.11.42	He will extend his hand against other countries; the land of Egypt will not escape. 
DAN.11.43	He will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver, as well as all of the riches of Egypt. The Libyans and the Cushites will also be under his feet. 
DAN.11.44	But reports from the east and north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 
DAN.11.45	He will pitch his royal tents between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will meet his doom with no one to help him.’ 
DAN.12.1	“At that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has never occurred since the beginning of the nation until then. But at that time your people—everyone who is found written in the book—will be delivered. 
DAN.12.2	Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake—some to everlasting life, and others to shame and everlasting contempt. 
DAN.12.3	Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavenly expanse. And those who turn many to righteousness will be like the stars forever and ever. 
DAN.12.4	But you, Daniel, close up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase.’ 
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others stood there, one on this bank of the river and the one on the other bank of the river. 
DAN.12.6	One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long until the end of the wondrous things?” 
DAN.12.7	Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised both his right and left hands toward heaven and swore an oath by Him who lives forever, saying, “It is for a time, times, and a half. Then when the breaking of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these things will be finished.” 
DAN.12.8	Now I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, ‘My Lord, what will be the outcome of these things?’ 
DAN.12.9	Then he said: “Go your way, Daniel. For the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly. None of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand. 
DAN.12.11	“From the time that the daily burnt offering is taken away, and abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. 
DAN.12.12	Happy is the one who keeps waiting, and reaches the 1,335 days. 
DAN.12.13	But you, go your way till the end. You will rest and then at the end of days you will arise to receive your portion.”
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of 
EZR.1.2	“Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: 
EZR.1.3	Whoever is among you from all His people—may his God be with him—may go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the House of 
EZR.1.4	As for anyone who remains, wherever they may be living, let the people of those places supply him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill offerings for the House of God in Jerusalem.” 
EZR.1.5	So the patriarchal leaders of Judah and Benjamin, along with the 
EZR.1.6	All those around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, gold, goods, cattle and valuable gifts, besides all that was willingly offered. 
EZR.1.7	Then King Cyrus brought out the vessels from the House of 
EZR.1.8	King Cyrus of Persia had them brought out by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out for Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	And this was the inventory of them: gold basins—30 silver basins—1,000 silver utensils—29 
EZR.1.10	gold bowls—30 other silver bowls—410 other vessels—1,000 
EZR.1.11	In all there were 5,400 vessels of gold and silver. Sheshbatzar brought them all along when the exiles were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem. 
EZR.2.1	Now these are the people of the province who went up from the captives of the exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive to Babylon. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his town.

EZR.2.58	All the Temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants—392. 
EZR.2.59	The following came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they were not able to prove their family connection or their ancestry whether they were from Israel: 
EZR.2.60	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda—652. 
EZR.2.61	Also from the sons of the 
EZR.2.62	These sought their records in the genealogical lists, but did not find them. So they were disqualified from the priesthood. 
EZR.2.63	As a result, the governor said to them that they should not eat any of the most holy food until a 
EZR.2.64	The entire assembly totaled 42,360, 
EZR.2.65	not including their male and female servants, who numbered 7,337. They also had 200 male and female singers. 
EZR.2.66	They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
EZR.2.67	 435 camels, 6,702 donkeys. 
EZR.2.68	When they arrived at the House of 
EZR.2.69	According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 gold drachmas, 5,000 silver minas and 100 priestly tunics. 
EZR.2.70	Now the 
EZR.3.1	When the seventh month arrived and the sons of Israel were settled in the towns, the people gathered together as one man in Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then Jeshua son of Jozadak, his fellow 
EZR.3.3	They set up the altar on its fixed resting place despite their fear of the peoples of the lands and they offered burnt offerings on it to 
EZR.3.4	They also kept the Feast of 
EZR.3.5	After that they presented the regular burnt offerings, the new moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the sacred 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to 
EZR.3.7	So they gave money to the stone-masons and carpenters, and food, beverages, and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians to bring cedar trees by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by King Cyrus of Persia. 
EZR.3.8	In the second month of the second year after they had come to the House of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers—the 
EZR.3.9	Then Jeshua, his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, stood together to supervise those working in the House of God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons, and their brothers, the Levites. 
EZR.3.10	When the builders had laid the foundation of the Temple of 
EZR.3.11	With praise and thanksgiving they sang to 
EZR.3.12	But many of the 
EZR.3.13	People could not distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of the people’s weeping. For the people were shouting so loudly that the sound was heard far away. 
EZR.4.1	When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple for 
EZR.4.2	they approached Zerubbabel and the leading patriarchs and said to them, “Let us build with you, for like you we seek your God and have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who brought us here.” 
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of the prominent patriarchs of Israel said to them, “It is not for you and us to build a House for our God—but we alone will build it for 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land began discouraging the people of Judah and making them afraid to build. 
EZR.4.5	They bribed advisors in order to thwart their plans all the days of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
EZR.4.6	During the reign of Ahasuerus at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 
EZR.4.7	Also during the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated. 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows: 
EZR.4.9	From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates—the judges and the officials, the magistrates, and governors over the Erechites, the Babylonians, the people of Susa (that is, the Elamites) 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the peoples whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and the rest of Trans-Euphrates. (Now 
EZR.4.11	this is a copy of the letter they sent to him.) To Artaxerxes the king, from your servants, the men of Trans-Euphrates: Now 
EZR.4.12	let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city. They are completing the walls and repairing the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	“Furthermore, let it be known to the king, that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, no more tribute, taxes or duty will be paid and the royal revenue will suffer. 
EZR.4.14	Now since we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king 
EZR.4.15	so that a search may be made in the book of records of your fathers and you will discover in the records and know that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, inciting internal revolts from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed. 
EZR.4.16	We are informing the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls completed, you will no longer have any possession in Trans-Euphrates.” 
EZR.4.17	The king sent this reply: “To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who dwell in Samaria and the others in Trans-Euphrates. “
EZR.4.18	“The letter that you sent to us has been translated and read in my presence. 
EZR.4.19	At my order a search was made and it was found that this city has from earliest times revolted against kings and that rebellion and sedition continually occur in it. 
EZR.4.20	Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem governing all the Trans-Euphrates, and tribute, taxes, and duty were paid to them. 
EZR.4.21	“So now, issue a decree to stop these men—this city is not to be rebuilt until I issue a decree. 
EZR.4.22	Be careful not to be negligent in this matter. Why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?” 
EZR.4.23	Then, as soon as the copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read in the presence of Rehum, Shimshai the scribe and their associates, they hurried off to the Jews in Jerusalem and by force and power compelled them to stop. 
EZR.4.24	Thus the work on the House of God in Jerusalem ceased. It remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them. 
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the House of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them supporting them. 
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates came to them and asked them, “Who gave you the authority to build this House and to complete this structure?” 
EZR.5.4	They also asked them, “What are the names of the men who are constructing this building?” 
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and a written reply about it be returned. 
EZR.5.6	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shetar-bozenai, and his colleagues, officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius. 
EZR.5.7	The report they sent to him was written as follows: “To King Darius. “All 
EZR.5.8	“Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the House of the great God, which is being built with large stones and timber is being set in the walls. Now this work is being done diligently and is succeeding in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then we questioned those elders, asking them, ‘Who gave you the authority to build this House and to complete this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names in order to inform you, so that we might write the names of the men who were in charge of them. 
EZR.5.11	They responded to us saying, ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the House that was built many years ago. A great king of Israel built and finished it. 
EZR.5.12	But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Chaldean. He destroyed this House and carried the people away to Babylon. 
EZR.5.13	‘However, in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this House of God. 
EZR.5.14	Even the gold and silver utensils of the House of God that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and had carried away to the temple in Babylon—King Cyrus took those things from the temple in Babylon and gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor. 
EZR.5.15	‘Then he said to him, “Take these vessels and go and deposit them in the Temple in Jerusalem and let the House of God be built in its place!” 
EZR.5.16	So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the House of God in Jerusalem. From that time until now it has been under construction, yet it is not yet finished.’ 
EZR.5.17	“Now, if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see if in fact King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this House of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision about this matter.”
EZR.6.1	King Darius then issued an order and a search was made in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it: “Memorandum: 
EZR.6.3	“In the first year of Cyrus the king, King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the House of God at Jerusalem. “Let the House be rebuilt as a place where sacrifices are offered. Let its foundations be laid. Its height is to be sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits 
EZR.6.4	with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. Let the expense be paid from the king’s house. 
EZR.6.5	Also let the gold and silver vessels of the House of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought to the Temple in Jerusalem; you shall deposit them in the House of God. 
EZR.6.6	“Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues, officials of Trans-Euphrates, all of you stay away from there. 
EZR.6.7	Leave the work of this House of God alone! Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this House of God in its place. 
EZR.6.8	“Moreover, I hereby issue a decree as to what you are to do for these elders of the Jews to rebuild this House of God. The complete costs are to be paid to these men from the royal treasury, from the tribute from Trans-Euphrates so that they are not hindered. 
EZR.6.9	“Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams or lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven or wheat, salt, wine and oil, as requested by the 
EZR.6.10	so that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 
EZR.6.11	“Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and impaled on it, and because of this, his house be made a pile of refuse. 
EZR.6.12	May God, who makes His name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts his hand to cause such change to destroy this House of God in Jerusalem. I Darius have issued a decree; let it be carried out with diligence.”
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai the governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates diligently carried it out, just as King Darius had sent. 
EZR.6.14	So the elders of the Jews continued building and prospering through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and according to the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	The Temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 
EZR.6.16	Then the sons of Israel—the 
EZR.6.17	For the dedication of this House of God they offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 male lambs, and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	They appointed the 
EZR.6.19	The exiles celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, 
EZR.6.20	for every one of the 
EZR.6.21	So those of 
EZR.6.22	They celebrated the Feast of Matzot with joy for seven days, because 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the 
EZR.7.7	Some of 
EZR.7.8	He arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	He began his 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart to seek the 
EZR.7.11	Now this is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the 
EZR.7.12	“Artaxerxes, king of kings, “To Ezra the 
EZR.7.13	“I have now issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel—even the 
EZR.7.14	For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand, 
EZR.7.15	and to bring the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	together with all the silver and gold that you find in the whole province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and the 
EZR.7.17	Furthermore, with this silver you should be sure to buy bulls, rams and lambs, along with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the House of your God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	You may do whatever seems good to you and your brothers with the remaining silver and gold, according to the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	“The vessels that are entrusted to you for the service of the House of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	The rest of the needs for the House of your God that you may have occasioned to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury. 
EZR.7.21	“I, King Artaxerxes, hereby issue a decree to all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates to diligently provide all that Ezra the 
EZR.7.22	up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt without limit. 
EZR.7.23	Everything that the God of heaven has required, let it be done with diligence for the House of the God of heaven. For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
EZR.7.24	We also notify you that you have no authority to impose tribute, tax or duty on any of the 
EZR.7.25	“Now you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint judges and magistrates who may administer justice to all the people in Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach those who do not know them. 
EZR.7.26	Let anyone who does not observe the Law of your God and the law of the king, be punished with due diligence, whether it is death or banishment, confiscation of goods or imprisonment.” 
EZR.7.27	Blessed be 
EZR.7.28	and who has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and all the king’s mighty princes. I gained strength, as the hand of 
EZR.8.1	Now these are the patriarchal leaders, and the genealogical records of those who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes: 
EZR.8.2	from the sons of Phinehas—Gershom; from the sons of Ithamar—Daniel; from the sons of David—Hattush; 
EZR.8.3	from the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh—Zechariah and with him were 150 males were enrolled by genealogy; 
EZR.8.4	from the sons of Pahath-moab—Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and with him were 200 males enrolled by genealogy; 
EZR.8.5	from the sons of Shechaniah—the son of Jahaziel and 300 males with him. 
EZR.8.6	from the sons of Adin—Ebed the son of Jonathan and 50 males with him; 
EZR.8.7	from the sons of Elam—Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and 70 males with him; 
EZR.8.8	from the sons of Shephatiah—Zebadiah the son of Michael and 80 males with him; 
EZR.8.9	from the sons of Joab—Obadiah the son of Jehiel and 128 males with him; 
EZR.8.10	from the sons of Shelomith—the son of Josiphiah and 160 males with him; 
EZR.8.11	from the sons of Bebai—Zechariah the son of Bebai and 28 males with him; 
EZR.8.12	from the sons of Azgad—Johanan the son of Hakkatan and 110 males with him; 
EZR.8.13	from the sons of Adonikam (they came later, but these are their names)—Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah and 60 males with them; 
EZR.8.14	from the sons of Bigvai—Uthai and Zaccur and 70 males with him. 
EZR.8.15	I assembled them at the river that flows toward Ahava. We camped there for three days, and I observed the people and the 
EZR.8.16	So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders and for Joiarib and Elnatan who were men of learning. 
EZR.8.17	I sent them to Iddo, the leader at the place Casiphia. I put words in their mouths to speak to Iddo and his brother, who were sanctuary servants at Casiphia, in order to bring us ministers for the House of our God. 
EZR.8.18	Now as the good hand of our God was upon us, they brought us Sherebiah, a man of insight from the sons of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel, along with his sons and his brothers, 18 men. 
EZR.8.19	Also Hashabiah together with Jeshaiah from the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, 20 men. 
EZR.8.20	Also from the sanctuary servants, whom David and his officials had given for the work of the Levites, 220 sanctuary servants, all of them designated by name. 
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there at the Ahava River so that we might humble ourselves before our God and seek from Him a straight way for us, our little ones, and all of our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and cavalry to protect us from the enemy along the way, because we had spoken to the king saying, “The gracious hand of our God is upon everyone who seeks Him, but His great anger is against everyone who forsakes Him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and sought our God about this, and He responded to our plea. 
EZR.8.24	Then I set apart twelve of the leading 
EZR.8.25	and I weighed out for them the silver, the gold and the utensils, the contribution to the House of our God that the king, his counselors, his officials and all Israel who were present had offered. 
EZR.8.26	Specifically, I weighed into their hand 650 talents of silver, silver utensils worth 100 talents, 100 talents of gold, 
EZR.8.27	20 golden bowels valued at 1000 darics, and two exquisite vessels of gleaming bronze, as precious as gold. 
EZR.8.28	Then I said to them, “You are holy to 
EZR.8.29	Guard them carefully until you weigh them before the leading 
EZR.8.30	So the 
EZR.8.31	Then we set out from the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was upon us and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the way. 
EZR.8.32	So we came to Jerusalem and remained there for three days. 
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day the silver, the gold, and the utensils were weighed out in the House of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the 
EZR.8.34	Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time. 
EZR.8.35	Then the exiles returning from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs and as a sin offering 12 male goats. All of this was a burnt offering to 
EZR.8.36	Then they delivered the decrees of the king to the king’s Persian governors and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave help to the people and the House of God.
EZR.9.1	Now when these things had been completed, the leaders approached me to say: “The people of Israel, the 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons and have mingled the holy seed with the peoples of the lands. Indeed, the hand of the leaders and the officials have been at the forefront in this unfaithful act.” 
EZR.9.3	When I heard this report, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled out some of the hair from my head and from my beard. Then I sat down devastated. 
EZR.9.4	Everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered themselves around me because of the unfaithful act of the exiles. Devastated, I sat there until the evening offering. 
EZR.9.5	At the time of the evening offering, I rose up from my self-abasement with my garment and robe torn, then I bowed down on my knees and spread out my hands to 
EZR.9.6	I prayed, “O my God, I am ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God! For our iniquities are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our fathers to this day our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities we, our kings and our 
EZR.9.8	“But now for a brief moment 
EZR.9.9	Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, reviving us in order to restore the House of our God, to raise up its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. 
EZR.9.10	“So now, our God, what should we say after this? For we have forsaken Your 
EZR.9.11	that You commanded through Your servants the prophets saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurities of the peoples of the lands. Through their abominations, they have filled it from one end to the other with their uncleanness. 
EZR.9.12	Therefore, do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek their 
EZR.9.13	“After everything that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and our great guilt—for You, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and given us a remnant such as this—
EZR.9.14	shall we once again break Your 
EZR.9.15	, God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left this day as a remnant. Behold, here we are before You in our guilt; because of it no one can stand before You.”
EZR.10.1	While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and prostrating himself before the House of God, a very large assembly of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. The people also wept very bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 
EZR.10.3	So now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their offspring, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the 
EZR.10.4	Arise! For this matter concerns you. We are with you, so be strong and do it!” 
EZR.10.5	So Ezra rose up and made the leading 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra got up from before the House of God and went into the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no bread and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles. 
EZR.10.7	A proclamation was then circulated throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all of the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	Everyone who did not come within three days, would forfeit all his property according to the counsel of the officials and the elders, and would himself be excluded from the assembly of the exiles. 
EZR.10.9	So within three days all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the plaza before the House of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the rain. 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the 
EZR.10.11	So now, give praise to 
EZR.10.12	The entire assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “Yes, we will do just as you have said. 
EZR.10.13	However, there are many people here and it is the rainy season, and we are not able to stand outside. Besides, this task cannot be resolved in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter. 
EZR.10.14	Let our leaders stand for the whole assembly. Let everyone in our cities who has married a foreign woman come at an appointed time, and with them the elders of each city and its judges, until the burning wrath of our God is turned back from us in this matter.” 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah stood against this, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite. 
EZR.10.16	So the exiles did as proposed. Ezra the 
EZR.10.17	and they were finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women on the first day of the first month. 
EZR.10.18	Among the sons of the 
EZR.10.19	They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt, they offered a ram of the flock as a guilt offering. 
EZR.10.20	Also from the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 
EZR.10.21	From the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah. 
EZR.10.22	From the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah. 
EZR.10.23	From the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah—he is Kelita—Pethahiah, Judah and Eliezer. 
EZR.10.24	From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri. 
EZR.10.25	Also from Israel: From the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.26	From the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah. 
EZR.10.27	From the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza. 
EZR.10.28	From the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai and Athlai. 
EZR.10.29	From the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal and Ramoth. 
EZR.10.30	From the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh. 
EZR.10.31	From the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch and Shemariah. 
EZR.10.33	From the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh and Shimei. 
EZR.10.34	From the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhu, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasai, 
EZR.10.38	Bani, Binnui, Shimei, 
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah and Joseph. 
EZR.10.43	From the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.44	All these had taken foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: Now it happened that in the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in Shushan the capitol, 
NEH.1.2	that Hanani, one of my brothers, together with some men from Judah, arrived and I asked them about the Judeans, the remnant who had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “The remnant who have survived the captivity there in the province are in great distress and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.” 
NEH.1.4	Upon hearing these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days. I prayed and fasted before the God of heaven.
NEH.1.5	Then I said: “
NEH.1.6	please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant that I am praying before You today both day and night on behalf of Your servants, the 
NEH.1.7	We have acted very corruptly against You. We have not kept the 
NEH.1.8	“Please recall the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples, 
NEH.1.9	but if you return to Me and obey My 
NEH.1.10	“They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great strength and by Your mighty hand. 
NEH.1.11	Please, my Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants who delight in revering Your Name. Give Your servant success today and grant compassion in the presence of this man.” Now I was cupbearer to the king. 
NEH.2.1	Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before. 
NEH.2.2	So the king said to me, “Why is your face so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.” I was very frightened, 
NEH.2.3	but I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?” 
NEH.2.4	The king asked me, “What is your request?” Then I prayed to the God of heaven, 
NEH.2.5	and I answered the king, “If it seems good to the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight, send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried that I may rebuild it.” 
NEH.2.6	Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” Since it pleased the king to send me, I set a time for him. 
NEH.2.7	I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let him give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates that will enable me to pass through until I arrive in Judah, 
NEH.2.8	as well as a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest so he will give me lumber to make beams for the gates of the fortress adjacent to the Temple, for the wall of the city and for the residence I will occupy.” The king granted me the requests because the good hand of my God was upon me. 
NEH.2.9	Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and I gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officials and cavalry with me. 
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite officials heard all this, they were very displeased that a man had come to seek the welfare of 
NEH.2.11	I came to Jerusalem, and after I was there for three days, 
NEH.2.12	I got up during the night along with a few men. But I did not tell anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me except the animal I was riding. 
NEH.2.13	By night I went out by the Valley Gate toward Jackal Spring and the Dung Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I moved on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, where there was not enough room for my animal to pass with me; 
NEH.2.15	so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and returned to the Valley Gate. 
NEH.2.16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, but as yet I had not told the Jews, the 
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in: Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burnt. Come! Let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a disgrace.” 
NEH.2.18	Then I told them how the good hand of my God was on me and the words that the king had said to me. Then they replied, “Let us begin building!” So they prepared themselves for this good work. 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. They said, “What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” 
NEH.2.20	I responded to them saying, “The God of heaven will bring us success. We His servants will arise and build. But you have no part, right, or historical claim in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the 
NEH.3.2	The men of Jericho built next to it and Zaccur the son of Imri built next to them. 
NEH.3.3	The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They laid its beams and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.4	Next to them Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz made repairs. Adjacent to them Meshullam son of Berechiah, son of Meshezabel made repairs, and next to them Zadok son of Baana made repairs. 
NEH.3.5	The men of Tekoa made repairs next to them, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work of their masters. 
NEH.3.6	Joiada son of Paseah, and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate. They laid its beams and set up its doors, its bolts and its bars. 
NEH.3.7	Adjacent to them worked Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, men from Gibeon and Mizpah who are under the jurisdiction of the governor of Trans-Euphrates. 
NEH.3.8	Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, worked adjacent to him, and Hananiah, one of the perfumers, worked next to him. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. 
NEH.3.9	Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem made repairs next to them. 
NEH.3.10	Jedaiah son of Harumaph repaired the section adjacent to them opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah worked next to them. 
NEH.3.11	Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Furnaces. 
NEH.3.12	Shallum son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, and his daughters repaired the next section. 
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. They also repaired a thousand cubits of wall up to the Dung Gate. 
NEH.3.14	Malchijah son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-cherem, repaired the Dung Gate. He built it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.15	Shallun son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He built it, covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah by the King’s Garden, as far as the stairs going down from the City of David. 
NEH.3.16	Beyond him Nehemiah son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, made repairs as far as the tombs of David and the artificial pool and the House of the Warriors. 
NEH.3.17	After him, the Levites made repairs under Rehum son of Bani, and beside him, Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district. 
NEH.3.18	After him repairs were made by their brothers under Bavvai son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah. 
NEH.3.19	Adjacent to him Ezer son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the corner buttress.
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch son of Zaccai zealously repaired another section from the corner buttress up to the door of the house of Eliashib, the 
NEH.3.21	After him Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib. 
NEH.3.22	And after him the 
NEH.3.23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house. After them Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, worked beside his house. 
NEH.3.24	Beyond him Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section from the house of Azariah up to the inner buttress and the corner. 
NEH.3.25	Palal son of Uzai made repairs opposite the inner buttress and the tower coming out from the upper palace, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah son of Parosh 
NEH.3.26	and the Temple servants living on the Ophel made repairs up to the area opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower. 
NEH.3.27	After him the men of Tekoa repaired another section from opposite the great projecting tower to the wall of the Ophel. 
NEH.3.28	Above the Horse Gate the 
NEH.3.29	After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house and after him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the guard of the East Gate, made repairs. 
NEH.3.30	After him Hananiah, son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another portion. After him Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs in front of his living quarters. 
NEH.3.31	After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs up to the house of the Temple servants, and the merchants opposite the Inspection Gate and as far as the room above the corner. 
NEH.3.32	Between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants worked. 
NEH.3.33	Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he became very angry and was greatly enraged. He mocked the Jews 
NEH.3.34	in the presence of his colleagues and the army of Samaria, saying: “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble that are burnt?” 
NEH.3.35	Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said: “Even if a fox climbed on what they are building, it would break down their stone wall!” 
NEH.3.36	Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insult back on their own head! Give them up as plunder in a land of captivity. 
NEH.3.37	Do not cover their guilt or blot out their sin from before You, for they have provoked You to anger before the builders. 
NEH.3.38	So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a heart to work.
NEH.4.1	Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that restoration of the walls of Jerusalem was proceeding and that the breaches had begun to be closed, they became extremely angry. 
NEH.4.2	They all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to stir up trouble against it. 
NEH.4.3	But we prayed to our God and stationed a guard against them day and night. 
NEH.4.4	Meanwhile the people of Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing. There is so much rubble that we are unable to rebuild the wall.” 
NEH.4.5	Our adversaries also said, “They will not know or perceive anything, until we come among them and kill them, and put an end to the work!” 
NEH.4.6	So it happened that the Jews living near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us!”
NEH.4.7	So I stationed people in the lower places behind the wall in the exposed places. I stationed the people by families with their swords, spears and bows. 
NEH.4.8	When I looked things over, I rose up and said to the nobles, the rulers and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the great and awesome Lord, and fight on behalf of your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.” 
NEH.4.9	Now when our enemies heard that their plan was known to us, and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. 
NEH.4.10	From that day on, half of my men were doing the work, while half of them took hold of the spears, shields, bows and breastplates, and the leaders were behind the entire house of Judah.
NEH.4.11	Those building the wall and those bearing heavy burdens kept one hand on the work and the other holding a weapon. 
NEH.4.12	So each of the builders had his sword strapped to his side while they were building, and the 
NEH.4.13	Then I said to the nobles, the rulers and the rest of the people, “The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from one another on the wall. 
NEH.4.14	Wherever you hear the sound of the 
NEH.4.15	So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from dawn until the stars came out. 
NEH.4.16	Also at that time I said to the people, “Let every man and his helper lodge inside Jerusalem, so they can be guards for us by night and workers by day.” 
NEH.4.17	So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my workers, nor the guards who were with me took off our clothes; each man even had his weapon at the water. 
NEH.5.1	Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives to their fellow Jews. 
NEH.5.2	There were those who said, “We and our sons and our daughters are numerous. We must take grain, so we may eat and live.” 
NEH.5.3	There were others who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses in order to obtain grain during the famine.” 
NEH.5.4	Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	And now, though we share the same flesh as our brothers, and our children are just like their children, still we subject our sons and our daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved but our hands are tied since our fields and vineyards belong to others.” 
NEH.5.6	I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	I pondered them in my heart and then I opposed the nobles and the officials, saying to them, “Usury! Each of you is putting his brother in debt!” So I convened a great assembly to deal with them. 
NEH.5.8	I said to them, “As much as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who had been sold to the nations. Now you also are selling your brothers so that they will be sold back to us?” Then they became silent and could not find anything to say. 
NEH.5.9	Then I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good! Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God, in order to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies? 
NEH.5.10	Even I, my brothers, and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let this usury stop, now! 
NEH.5.11	Now, return to them this very day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, as well as the hundredth that you have extracted from them on the money, the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil.” 
NEH.5.12	Then they said, “We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do just as you say.” Then I summoned the 
NEH.5.13	Also I shook out my garment, and said, “In this way may God shake out from His house and from His property every one that does not keep this promise. In this way may he be shaken out and emptied!” And all the assembly replied, “Amen!” and they praised 
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the day when I was appointed to be the governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years—neither I, nor my relatives have eaten the bread allocated to the governor. 
NEH.5.15	The earlier governors, those preceding me, placed heavy burdens on the people, and took bread and wine from them, in addition to forty shekels of silver. Their attendants also lorded over the people. But I did not do so, out of fear of God. 
NEH.5.16	Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall, without even buying a field. All my attendants were gathered there for the work. 
NEH.5.17	Furthermore, 150 Judeans and officials, as well as those that came to us from the nations around us, were at my table. 
NEH.5.18	Now, each day one ox and six choice sheep, as well as some fowl, were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundance of every kind of wine was prepared. Despite all this, I did not require the governor’s food allowance, because the work was already heavy on this people. 
NEH.5.19	Remember me for good, O my God, for all that I have done for this people. 
NEH.6.1	Now it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and no breach remained in it—even though at that time I had not positioned the doors in the gates. 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they were scheming to do me harm. 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them saying, “I am doing an important work, so I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” 
NEH.6.4	They sent me the same message four times, and each time I returned a similar response to them. 
NEH.6.5	But the fifth time Sanballat sent his young aide to me in this way, he had an open letter in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	In it was written: “It has been heard among the nations—and Geshem substantiates it—that you and the Jews are planning to revolt. That is why you are rebuilding the wall. Furthermore, according to these reports, you are to become their king 
NEH.6.7	and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem saying, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ Now, the king is going to hear about these reports. So come now! Let us confer together.” 
NEH.6.8	Then I sent a message to him, saying, “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are devising them from your own heart.” 
NEH.6.9	For they were all trying to intimidate us, thinking, “Their hands will become weak from the work and it will not be done.” So now, strengthen my hands! 
NEH.6.10	Then I went to the house of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel. He was confined to his home. He said, “Let us meet in the House of God, within the Temple. Let us shut the doors of the Temple, for they are coming to kill you. Indeed, they will come to kill you at night.” 
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who in my position could go into the Temple and live? I will not go in.” 
NEH.6.12	I recognized that God had not really sent him, for he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	He had been hired so that I might become so frightened that I would do this and thereby sin. Then they would give me a bad name in order to discredit me. 
NEH.6.14	Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me. 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in just 52 days. 
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies heard, all the surrounding nations were afraid and fell greatly in their own eyes, because they realized that this work had been accomplished by our God. 
NEH.6.17	Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were under oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 
NEH.6.19	Moreover, they kept telling me about his good deeds and then reporting my words to him. Also Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
NEH.7.1	After the wall had been rebuilt, the doors set up, and the gatekeepers, singers and Levites appointed, 
NEH.7.2	I put in charge over Jerusalem, my brother Hanani along with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, for he was a man of integrity and feared God more than many. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun is hot. While those are still on duty, have them shut and bar the doors. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their post and some near their homes.” 
NEH.7.4	Now the city was spacious and large, but there were few people within it and no houses were being built. 
NEH.7.5	So my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be registered by genealogy. I found the scroll of the genealogical record of those who formerly returned. I found the following written there: 
NEH.7.6	These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had taken away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each man to his own town. 
NEH.7.7	Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of

NEH.7.43	The Levites: the sons of Jeshua of Kadmiel from the sons of Hodeiah—74

NEH.7.45	The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita and the sons of Shobai—138. 
NEH.7.46	The sanctuary servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaot,

NEH.7.59	the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim and the sons of Amon. 
NEH.7.60	All the Temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants—392. 
NEH.7.61	Now the following were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer—but they were not able to identify their ancestral houses or whether their descendants were from Israel: 
NEH.7.62	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah and the sons of Nekoda—642. 
NEH.7.63	Also of the 
NEH.7.64	These sought their names in the genealogies, but were not found; so they were disqualified from the priesthood. 
NEH.7.65	The governor said to them that they should not eat any of the most holy things until a 
NEH.7.66	The whole congregation together was 42,360, 
NEH.7.67	not including their male and female servants—these were 7,337—as well as 245 male and female singers. 
NEH.7.68	There were 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys. 
NEH.7.69	Some from among the family leaders contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury: gold drachmas—1,000; bowls—50; and priestly tunics—500. 
NEH.7.70	Those from the heads of ancestral lines gave to the treasury for the work: gold drachmas—20,000; silver minas—2,000. 
NEH.7.71	The rest of the people gave: gold drachmas—20,000; silver minas—2,000; and priestly tunics—67. 
NEH.7.72	So the 
NEH.8.1	Then all the people were brought as a single body into the plaza that was before the Water Gate. They said to Ezra the scribe, “Bring out the 
NEH.8.2	Ezra the 
NEH.8.3	So he read from it before the plaza in front of the Water Gate from first light until midday, in the presence of the men and women, and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the scroll of the 
NEH.8.4	Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform constructed for this purpose. Standing near him at his right hand were Mattitiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah and at his left hand were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam. 
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the scroll in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people. When he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Ezra blessed 
NEH.8.7	The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbetai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the 
NEH.8.8	They read from the 
NEH.8.9	Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the 
NEH.8.10	So he said to them, “Go! Eat choice food, drink sweet drinks, and send portions to those who have nothing ready. For today is 
NEH.8.11	Then the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Hush! For today is 
NEH.8.12	So all the people departed to eat and drink, to send portions and to celebrate with great joy, because they came to understand the words that were explained to them. 
NEH.8.13	On the second day, the heads of the families along with the 
NEH.8.14	They found written in the 
NEH.8.15	So that they should proclaim and spread this message in all their towns and in Jerusalem saying, “Go out to the hill country and bring olive branches and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches and branches of other leafy trees to make sukkot, just as it is written.”
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and brought branches, and made sukkot for themselves, each on their own roof, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the House of God, in the plaza before the Water Gate and in the plaza of the Ephraim Gate. 
NEH.8.17	The entire assembly who had returned from the captivity made sukkot and dwelt in the sukkot. Since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day 
NEH.8.18	Day after day from the first day to the last day, he read from the scroll of the 
NEH.9.1	Now on the twenty-fourth day of this same month, 
NEH.9.2	The offspring of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, standing and confessing their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. 
NEH.9.3	They stood in their place and read in the scroll of the 
NEH.9.4	Then the Levites —Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani —stood on the platform and cried out with a loud voice to 
NEH.9.5	The Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said: “Stand up! Bless 
NEH.9.6	You alone are 
NEH.9.7	“You are 
NEH.9.8	You found his heart faithful before You and made the covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Jebusite and the Girgashite to his seed. You have fulfilled Your words, for You are righteous. 
NEH.9.9	“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds. 
NEH.9.10	You gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all the people of his land, for You knew how insolently they treated them. You made a name for Yourself which remains to this day. 
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land! But their pursuers You threw into the depths like a stone into mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	You led them with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire by night to illuminate for them the way they were to go. 
NEH.9.13	“You descended on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven. You gave them just judgments, reliable laws, and good statutes and 
NEH.9.14	You made known to them Your holy 
NEH.9.15	You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought them water from the rock for their thirst. You told them to go in to possess the land that You had sworn to give them. 
NEH.9.16	“But they, our ancestors, became arrogant. They stiffened their neck and did not obey Your 
NEH.9.17	They refused to obey and did not remember Your wonders that You did among them. Instead, they became stiff-necked and in their rebellion, appointed a leader in order to return to their bondage. But You are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in love. Therefore You did not abandon them, 
NEH.9.18	even when they made a cast image of a calf for themselves and said, ‘This is your god who brought you up from Egypt!’ or when they committed great blasphemies. 
NEH.9.19	“Yet in Your great compassion You did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud by day did not depart from above them, guiding them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, illuminating the way they should go. 
NEH.9.20	You also gave Your good 
NEH.9.21	For forty years You sustained them in the desert: they lacked nothing, their garments did not wear out and their feet did not swell. 
NEH.9.22	“You gave them kingdoms and peoples and You allotted them their boundaries of the land. They possessed the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan. 
NEH.9.23	You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven, and You brought them into the land that You told their ancestors to enter and inherit. 
NEH.9.24	So the children went in and possessed the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who were the inhabitants of the land. You delivered them into their hands, along with their kings and the peoples of the land to deal with them as they pleased. 
NEH.9.25	They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses full of every good thing—hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, and an abundance of fruit trees. They ate and were satisfied, and grew fat. They enjoyed Your great goodness. 
NEH.9.26	“Nonetheless they became contentious and rebelled against You. They cast Your 
NEH.9.27	Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies who oppressed them. But in the time of their distress, they cried out to You and You heard from heaven. According to Your great compassion, You gave them deliverers, who rescued them out of the hand of their enemies. 
NEH.9.28	“But as soon as they were at rest, they returned to doing evil before You. Therefore You abandoned them into the hand of their enemies who ruled over them. When they repented and cried out to You, You heard from heaven, and according to Your compassion You delivered them many times. 
NEH.9.29	“You warned them in order to turn them back to Your 
NEH.9.30	You bore with them for many years and admonished them by Your 
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless, in Your great compassion, You did not put an end to them or abandon them, for You are a gracious and compassionate God. 
NEH.9.32	“So now, our God—the great, mighty and awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy—do not let all the hardship that has befallen us seem insignificant to you—our kings, our leaders, our 
NEH.9.33	You are righteous in all that has come upon us. For You have acted faithfully while we have done wickedly. 
NEH.9.34	Our kings, our leaders, our 
NEH.9.35	“Even in their own kingdom with the abundance of Your good things that You gave them, or with the spacious and fertile land that You set before them, they did not serve You or turn back from their evil deeds. 
NEH.9.36	“But see, even today we are slaves! Slaves in the land that You gave to our ancestors to eat of its fruit and its bounty. We are slaves in it. 
NEH.9.37	Its abundant produce goes to the kings You have set over us due to our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please. We are in great distress!
NEH.10.1	“Now because of all this, we are making a binding agreement in writing, and the names of our leaders, our Levites and our 
NEH.10.2	On the sealed document were: Nehemiah, the governor, son of Hachaliah, Zedekiah, 
NEH.10.3	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.10.4	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, 
NEH.10.5	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 
NEH.10.6	Harim, Meremot, Obadiah, 
NEH.10.7	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 
NEH.10.8	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 
NEH.10.9	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the 
NEH.10.10	And the Levites were: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui from the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel, 
NEH.10.11	and their associates Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 
NEH.10.12	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 
NEH.10.13	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.10.14	Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu. 
NEH.10.15	The leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahat-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.16	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.17	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.18	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.19	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 
NEH.10.20	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 
NEH.10.21	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 
NEH.10.22	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 
NEH.10.23	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 
NEH.10.24	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 
NEH.10.25	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 
NEH.10.26	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 
NEH.10.27	and Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.28	Malluch, Harim, and Baanah. 
NEH.10.29	“Now the rest of the people —the 
NEH.10.30	all join their brothers the nobles, and enter into a curse and an oath to walk in the 
NEH.10.31	“Furthermore, we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, and we will not take their daughters for our sons. 
NEH.10.32	When the peoples of the land bring merchandise or any kind of grain on Shabbat, we will not buy from them on 
NEH.10.33	We also assume responsibility for the 
NEH.10.34	for the rows of bread, the regular grain offering and regular burnt offering, the 
NEH.10.35	“We—the 
NEH.10.36	Also to bring the firstfruits of our land and the first fruits of all fruit trees year by year to the House of 
NEH.10.37	and the firstborn of our sons and our livestock as written in the 
NEH.10.38	and the first of our coarse meal, along with our offerings—the fruit from every kind of tree, new wine and oil—to the 
NEH.10.39	“Also the 
NEH.10.40	For 
NEH.11.1	So the leaders of the people dwelt in Jerusalem while the remainder of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine remained in the other towns. 
NEH.11.2	Then the people blessed all the men who volunteered to dwell in Jerusalem. 
NEH.11.3	These are the leaders of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (Some of Israel, the 
NEH.11.4	and some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin dwelt in Jerusalem). From the sons of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, from the descendants of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	also Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, son of the Shilonite. 
NEH.11.6	In all, 468 sons of Perez dwelt in Jerusalem—valiant men. 
NEH.11.7	Now these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah. 
NEH.11.8	Following him were 928 valiant men. 
NEH.11.9	Joel son of Zichri was in charge over them; Judah son of Hassenuah was second over the city. 
NEH.11.10	Of the 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the ruler of the House of God, 
NEH.11.12	their relatives who performed the work of the House—822. Also Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah, 
NEH.11.13	and his relatives, leaders of ancestral lines—242. Also Amashsai son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer, 
NEH.11.14	and their relatives were 128 valiant warriors. Zabdiel son of Haggedolim was in charge over them. 
NEH.11.15	From the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah of Bunni. 
NEH.11.16	From the leaders of the Levites, Shabbethai and Jozabad had oversight over the external business of the House of God. 
NEH.11.17	Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, the director who led the thanksgiving prayer. Also Bakbukiah, second among his relatives, and then Abda son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	In all there were 284 Levites in the holy city. 
NEH.11.19	Also there were 172 gatekeepers Akkub, Talmon and their brothers—who kept watch at the gates. 
NEH.11.20	The rest of Israel, the 
NEH.11.21	But the Temple servants dwelt on the Ophel, with Ziha and Gishpa over the Temple servants. 
NEH.11.22	The one in charge over the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph who were singers responsible for the service in the House of God. 
NEH.11.23	The king’s command concerning them was to provide regular daily support for the singers. 
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, from the descendants of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s agent for any matter concerning the people. 
NEH.11.25	Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah dwelt in Kiriat-arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, in Jekabzeel and its villages, 
NEH.11.26	in Jeshua; in Moladah, in Beth-pelet; 
NEH.11.27	in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns, 
NEH.11.28	in Ziklag, in Meconah and its towns, 
NEH.11.29	in En-rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	in Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its towns. So they settled from Beersheba to the Hinnom valley. 
NEH.11.31	The descendants of Benjamin dwelt in Geba, Michmas and Aijah, Bethel and its towns, 
NEH.11.32	Anatoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod, Ono and Ge-harashim. 
NEH.11.36	Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah settled with Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	Now these are the 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremot, 
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 
NEH.12.5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the 
NEH.12.8	The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and also Mattaniah—he and his brothers conducted the songs of praise— 
NEH.12.9	and Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, were opposite them in ranks. 
NEH.12.10	Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua. 
NEH.12.12	In the days of Joiakim, the family leaders of the 
NEH.12.13	Meshullam for Ezra, Jehohanan for Amariah, 
NEH.12.14	Jonathan for Melicu, Joseph for Shebaniah, 
NEH.12.15	Adna for Harim, Helkai for Meraiot, 
NEH.12.16	Zechariah for Iddo, Meshullam for Ginnethon, 
NEH.12.17	Zichri for Abijah, Piltai for Miniamin and Moadiah, 
NEH.12.18	Shammua for Bilgah, Jehonathan for Shemaiah, 
NEH.12.19	Mattenai for Joiarib, Uzzi for Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.20	Kallai for Sallai, Eber for Amok, 
NEH.12.21	Hashabiah for Hilkiah, and Nethanel for Jedaiah. 
NEH.12.22	The family heads of the Levites were recorded in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, as well as for the 
NEH.12.23	The family leaders among the sons of Levi were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib. 
NEH.12.24	So the leaders of the Levites were: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, with their brothers facing them, to give praise and thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, one section responding to the other. 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers guarding the storehouses at the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the 
NEH.12.27	At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought out Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with joy and thanksgiving, and songs with cymbals, harps and lyres.
NEH.12.28	The companies of singers were also assembled from the district around Jerusalem and from the Netophathite villages, 
NEH.12.29	and from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmavet, for the singers had built communities for themselves round about Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	After the 
NEH.12.31	Then I led the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give thanks. One of the processions went to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate, 
NEH.12.32	and going after them, Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah—
NEH.12.33	Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah and Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	some of the 
NEH.12.36	and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani—all with the musical instruments of David the man of God—and Ezra the scribe was ahead of them. 
NEH.12.37	They went over the Fountain Gate and continued up the stairs of the city of David at the ascent to the wall, and passed, above the house of David all the way to the Water Gate toward the east. 
NEH.12.38	The second thanksgiving choir proceeded to the left. I followed them, along with half of the people on the wall above the Tower of the Furnaces as far as the Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	over the Ephraim Gate, the gate of the old city, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Gate of the Guard. 
NEH.12.40	So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the House of God. 
NEH.12.41	So did I along with half the officials with me, and the 
NEH.12.42	and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. The singers sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. 
NEH.12.43	On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The joy in Jerusalem could be heard from far off. 
NEH.12.44	On that day men were appointed over the storehouses for the offerings, firstfruits and tithes. They were to gather into them the portions from the fields of the cities required by the 
NEH.12.45	They kept the ceremonial functions of their God and the ceremony of the purification according to the command of David and of Solomon his son. 
NEH.12.46	For of old, in the days of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers who sang songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel gave daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers. They also set apart the portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the portion for the sons of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day, the scroll of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people. The command was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should enter into the assembly of God forever. 
NEH.13.2	For they did not meet 
NEH.13.3	When they heard the 
NEH.13.4	Prior to this Eliashib the 
NEH.13.5	He was closely associated with Tobiah and provided him with a large chamber previously used to store the offerings, frankincense, and the Temple vessels, and also the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, along with the offerings for the 
NEH.13.6	I was not in Jerusalem during all this, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to the king. After a period of time, I requested to take leave from the king 
NEH.13.7	and returned to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done by preparing a chamber for Tobiah in the courts of the House of God. 
NEH.13.8	It greatly displeased me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household goods outside of the storeroom 
NEH.13.9	and commanded the storerooms to be cleansed. Then I restored the utensils of the House of God, the offerings and the frankincense. 
NEH.13.10	I also learned that the portions for the Levites had not been provided, and that each of the Levites and singers who performed the work had gone back to his own field. 
NEH.13.11	So I rebuked the leaders and asked, “Why has the House of God been forsaken?” I assembled them and stationed them at their posts. 
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine and oil to the storehouses. 
NEH.13.13	I put Shelemiah the 
NEH.13.14	Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loving kindness that I have done for the House of my God and for overseeing it. 
NEH.13.15	In those days, I saw in Judah some people treading winepresses on the Shabbat, some bringing and loading heaps of grain on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs and various other burdens, bringing them into Jerusalem on the 
NEH.13.16	Men from Tyre who lived there were bringing fish and all kinds of merchandise and were selling it on the 
NEH.13.17	So I complained to the nobles of Judah and asked them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing? You are profaning Yom Shabbat! 
NEH.13.18	Didn’t your ancestors do exactly the same causing our God to bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? So now you are bringing even more wrath upon Israel by profaning Yom Shabbat.” 
NEH.13.19	When evening darkness began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem before Yom Shabbat, I commanded the doors to be shut. I further commanded that they should not be opened till after Yom Shabbat. I appointed some of my attendants over the gates so that no burden could enter during Shabbat. 
NEH.13.20	Once or twice the traders and those selling all kinds of merchandise camped outside Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.21	But I warned them and said to them, “Why are you camping next to the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time they no longer came on the Shabbat. 
NEH.13.22	Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves, and to come and guard the gates in order to sanctify Yom Shabbat. Remember this also on my behalf, O my God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of your lovingkindness. 
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.
NEH.13.24	Half of their children spoke the dialect of Ashdod or the language of other peoples, but none of them understood the language of Judah. 
NEH.13.25	So I rebuked them. I cursed them, beat some of their men and pulled their beards. I made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons—or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin about these things? Yet among many nations there was never any king like him. Yes, he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, the foreign women caused even him to sin. 
NEH.13.27	Must we then hear about you doing all this great evil, thereby being unfaithful with our God by marrying foreign women?” 
NEH.13.28	Now one of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the 
NEH.13.29	O my God, please remember them for the defilement of the priesthood as well as the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
NEH.13.30	So I purged them from everything foreign and I assigned duties for the 
NEH.13.31	and for the wood offering at appointed times and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

1CH.4.24	The sons of Simeon: Nemuel, Jamim, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul, 
1CH.4.25	his son Shallum, his son Mibsam, and his son Mishma. 
1CH.4.26	The descendants of Mishma: Hammuel, Zaccur his son and Shimei his son. 
1CH.4.27	Now Shimei had 16 sons and six daughters. But his brothers did not have many sons, so their family did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah. 
1CH.4.28	They dwelt in Beer-sheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual, 
1CH.4.29	Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, 
1CH.4.30	Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,

1CH.4.33	along with all the villages that surrounded these towns as far as Baal. These were their habitations. Registered in their genealogical records were:

1CH.4.38	these mentioned by name were leaders in their families, and their clans increased greatly. 
1CH.4.39	Now they went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. 
1CH.4.40	They found rich and good pasture, and the land was spacious, quiet, and peaceful. The former inhabitants were Hamites. 
1CH.4.41	Now those whose names are recorded came during the days of King Hezekiah of Judah. They attacked the encampments of the Hamites, as well as the Meunim who were found there, and utterly wiped them out to this very day. They settled in their place because there was pasture there for their flocks. 
1CH.4.42	About 500 of them from the descendants of Simeon, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to Mount Seir 
1CH.4.43	where they struck down the remaining Amalekites who had escaped, and they live there to this day.
1CH.5.1	The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel—he was the firstborn, but when he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel—so he is not reckoned as the firstborn in the genealogical record.

1CH.5.7	His kinsmen by their families, as listed in their genealogical records: the leader Jeiel, Zechariah, 
1CH.5.8	and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel. They settled in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon, 
1CH.5.9	while in the east they settled as far as the entrance of the wilderness from this side of the river Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied in the land of Gilead. 
1CH.5.10	Now in the days of Saul they had made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand. So they lived in their encampments in the entire eastern area of Gilead. 
1CH.5.11	Now the sons of Gad lived opposite them in the land of Bashan as far as Salcah: 
1CH.5.12	Joel the leader, Shapham second, then Janai and Shaphat in Bashan. 
1CH.5.13	Their kinsmen according to their ancestral families: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia and Eber—seven in all.

1CH.5.18	The sons of Reuben and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors ready for war—men who carried shield and sword and drew the bow, and were skilled in battle. 
1CH.5.19	So they made war with the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. 
1CH.5.20	They received help against them, so that the Hagrites and all who were with them were delivered into their hand, for they cried out to God during the battle. He answered their supplications, because they put their trust in Him. 
1CH.5.21	They took away their livestock: 50,000 of their camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys, as well as 100,000 people. 
1CH.5.22	For many fell slain, because the war was of God. So they dwelt in their place until the exile.
1CH.5.23	Now the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir and Mount Hermon. They were numerous. 
1CH.5.24	These were the heads of their clans: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, Jahdiel. They were mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their clans. 
1CH.5.25	But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land whom God had destroyed before them. 
1CH.5.26	So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of King Pul of Assyria—the spirit of Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria—and he carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

1CH.10.8	The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1CH.10.9	They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the good news to their idols and to the people. 
1CH.10.10	They put his armor in the house of their gods, and hung his head in the house of Dagon. 
1CH.10.11	Now when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
1CH.10.12	all the valiant men arose and retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
1CH.10.13	So Saul died because of his unfaithful acts that he committed against the word of 
1CH.10.14	rather than inquire of 
1CH.11.1	Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron, saying: “Behold, we are your own flesh and blood. 
1CH.11.2	In the past, even when Saul was king, you were the one that led out and brought in Israel. 
1CH.11.3	When all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, David made a covenant with them in Hebron before 
1CH.11.4	Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem—that is Jebus, where the Jebusite inhabitants of the land lived. 
1CH.11.5	Now the residents of Jebus said to David, “You cannot get in here!” Nevertheless David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David. 
1CH.11.6	David had said, “Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will be commander-in-chief.” So Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became commander. 
1CH.11.7	David lived in the stronghold; for this reason it is called the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	He fortified the city all around, from the Millo to the surrounding walls, and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
1CH.11.9	David grew more and more powerful because 
1CH.11.10	Now these were chiefs of David’s mighty men, who strongly supported him in his kingdom, together with all Israel to make him king, according to the word of 
1CH.11.11	This is the list of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam the son of Hachmoni, was the chief of the 30; he wielded his spear against 300 and slew them all at one time. 
1CH.11.12	After him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. 
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pas Dammim, when the Philistines assembled there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley where the army retreated from before the Philistines, 
1CH.11.14	but they took a stand in the middle of the plot; they defended it and struck down the Philistines. 
1CH.11.15	Three of the 30 leaders went down to David at the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	At that time, David was in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. 
1CH.11.17	David had a craving and said, “If only someone would give me water to drink from the cistern by the gate in Bethlehem!” 
1CH.11.18	So the three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the cistern by the gate in Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But David refused to drink it. He poured it out to 
1CH.11.19	and said: “Far be it for me that I should do this before my God! Can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?”—for they brought it at the risk of their lives and he would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the Three mighty men. 
1CH.11.20	Abishai, Joab’s brother, was chief of the Three. He once wielded his spear against 300 and slew them. Thus he won a name among the Three. 
1CH.11.21	Of the Three, he was more highly esteemed than the other two and became their commander, even though he was not one of the three. 
1CH.11.22	Beniah son of Jehoiada was a valiant man from Kabzeel who had done mighty deeds. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab, and went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day.
1CH.11.23	He also killed the giant Egyptian man who was five cubits tall. In his hand the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam, yet Beniah attacked him with a club. He snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
1CH.11.24	These were the exploits of Beniah son of Jehoiada, who gained renown among the three mighty men. 
1CH.11.25	Behold, he was more honorable than the 30, yet he was not one of the Three. Nevertheless, David set him over his bodyguard. 
1CH.11.26	The mighty men were: Asael Joab’s brother, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 
1CH.11.27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.28	Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 
1CH.11.29	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
1CH.11.30	Mahrai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, 
1CH.11.31	Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
1CH.11.32	Hurai of Nahale-gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
1CH.11.33	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
1CH.11.34	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shageh the Hararite, 
1CH.11.35	Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur, 
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Meherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.37	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri, 
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite, Nahrai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah, 
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai, 
1CH.11.42	Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and 30 with him, 
1CH.11.43	Hanan son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
1CH.11.44	Uzzijah the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotam the Aroerite, 
1CH.11.45	Jedaiael son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite, 
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 
1CH.11.47	Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 
1CH.12.1	Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag when he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who assisted him in battle. 
1CH.12.2	They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left to sling stones and shoot arrows from the bow. They were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	Their chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite, 
1CH.12.4	 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the 30 and leading the 30, 
1CH.12.5	Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite, 
1CH.12.6	Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Hariphite, 
1CH.12.7	Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam, the Korahites, 
1CH.12.8	Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from Gedor. 
1CH.12.9	Some of the Gadites there withdrew to follow David to the stronghold in the wilderness. They were valiant men trained for battle, armed with shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains.
1CH.12.10	Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
1CH.12.11	Mish
1CH.12.12	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
1CH.12.13	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
1CH.12.14	Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. 
1CH.12.15	These were the Gadites, leaders of the army. The least was equal to 100 and the greatest to 1,000. 
1CH.12.16	These were the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing its banks, routing all those in the valleys to the east and to the west. 
1CH.12.17	Some of the children of Benjamin and also from Judah came to David at the stronghold. 
1CH.12.18	David went out to meet them and answered them saying, “If you come to me in peace to support me, then my heart will be united with you. But if it is to betray me to my adversaries, when my hands have done no wrong, then may the God of our fathers take notice and judge.” 
1CH.12.19	Then a spirit came upon Amasai, leader of the 30, “We are yours, David, on your side, son of Jesse. 
1CH.12.20	Some from Manasseh went over to David when he went with the Philistines to battle against Saul. But they did not help them because the Philistine rulers after consultation sent him away, saying: “It would cost us our heads if he defected to his master Saul.” 
1CH.12.21	When he went to Ziklag, these from Manasseh joined him—Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, Zillethai, the leaders of thousands that were from Manasseh. 
1CH.12.22	They helped David against the raiding bands, for all of them were valiant warriors and they were officers in the army. 
1CH.12.23	Day by day men came to David to help him until there was a great army like the army of God. 
1CH.12.24	These are the numbers of the heads of those armed for war who came to David in Hebron to transfer Saul’s kingdom to him, according to the word of 
1CH.12.25	The sons of Judah that bore shield and spear were 6,800, armed for war; 
1CH.12.26	from the sons of Simeon, 7,100 brave warriors ready for war; 
1CH.12.27	from the sons of Levi 4,600; 
1CH.12.28	Jehoiada the leader of the Aaronides and with him 3,700; 
1CH.12.29	Zadok, a young mighty man of valor, with 22 commanders from his clan; 
1CH.12.30	from the sons of Benjamin, Saul’s kinsmen, 3,000 for up to that time the majority of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house; 
1CH.12.31	from the sons of Ephraim 20,800 valliant warriors, famous men in their clan; 
1CH.12.32	from the half-tribe of Manasseh 18,000 who were designated by name to come and make David king; 
1CH.12.33	from the sons of Issachar—men who know how to interpret the signs of the times to determine what Israel should do—200 chiefs with all their kinsmen under their command; 
1CH.12.34	from Zebulun 50,000 warriors prepared for battle, arrayed with all types of weapons of war and ready to give their undivided loyalty; 
1CH.12.35	from Naphtali 1,000 officers, along with 37,000 with shield and spear; 
1CH.12.36	from the Danites, 28,600 equipped for battle; 
1CH.12.37	from Asher 40,000 experienced warriors arrayed for battle; 
1CH.12.38	and from beyond the Jordan, from the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh 120,000 armed with every type of weapons of war. 
1CH.12.39	All these fighting men, prepared for the battle line, came to Hebron with a whole heart to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel were also of one heart to make David king. 
1CH.12.40	So they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen had given them provision. 
1CH.12.41	Moreover those who were near to them, from as far as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There was flour, pressed figs, raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance—for indeed, there was joy in Israel. 
1CH.13.1	Then David consulted with the officers of the thousands and of the hundreds, with every leader. 
1CH.13.2	David said to the entire assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and is from 
1CH.13.3	Let us bring the Ark of our God back to us—for we did not inquire of it in the days of Saul.” 
1CH.13.4	The entire assembly agreed to do so, for the proposal seemed right in the eyes of all the people. 
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamat, to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
1CH.13.6	David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kiriath-jearim, that was in Judah to bring up from there the Ark of God, 
1CH.13.7	They transported the Ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab. Uzza and Ahio guided the cart 
1CH.13.8	while David and all Israel celebrated before God with all their might, with songs, lyres, harps, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets. 
1CH.13.9	But when they came to the threshing-floor of Hidon, Uzza reached out his hand to hold the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	The anger of 
1CH.13.11	David was angry because 
1CH.13.12	David feared God that day, saying, “How can I ever bring the Ark of God to me?” 
1CH.13.13	So David did not take the Ark with him to the City of David, but left it in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	So the Ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; 
1CH.14.1	Now King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, as well as cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters, to build a palace for him. 
1CH.14.2	Then David knew that 
1CH.14.3	David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David, but David heard of it and went out before them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	So David inquired of God, asking, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them over into my hand?” Then 
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Baal-perazim, where David defeated them. David said, “God burst out against my enemies by my hand, like waters burst out!” Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim . 
1CH.14.12	They abandoned their gods there, so David ordered and they were burned with fire. 
1CH.14.13	But the Philistines again raided the valley. 
1CH.14.14	So David again inquired of God, and God said to him, “Do not go up after them, but circle around behind them and come against them in front of the baca trees . 
1CH.14.15	As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baca trees, then go out to battle. For God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.” 
1CH.14.16	David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	So the fame of David spread throughout every land, and 
1CH.15.1	David built houses made for himself in the City of David; he then prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one should carry the Ark of God except the Levites, for 
1CH.15.3	David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the Ark of 
1CH.15.4	David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	from the sons of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his kinsmen; 
1CH.15.6	from the sons of Merari: Asaiah the leader and 220 0f his kinsmen; 
1CH.15.7	from the sons of Gershom: Joel the leader with 130 of his kinsmen; 
1CH.15.8	from the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the leader with 200 of his kinsmen; 
1CH.15.9	from the sons of Hebron: Eliel the leader with 80 of his kinsmen; 
1CH.15.10	from the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his kinsmen. 
1CH.15.11	David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the 
1CH.15.12	He told them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. Sanctify yourselves, you and your kinsmen, so that you may bring up the Ark of 
1CH.15.13	Because you were not there the first time, 
1CH.15.14	So the 
1CH.15.15	The Levites carried the Ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses commanded according to the word of 
1CH.15.16	David ordered the leaders of the Levites to appoint their kinsmen, the singers, with musical instruments, harps, lyres, and cymbals, to joyfully make their voices heard. 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the descendants of Merari, Ethan son of Kushaiah; 
1CH.15.18	and with them their relatives second in rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphalehu and Mikneiahu, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. 
1CH.15.19	The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoh, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play harps according to alamoth , 
1CH.15.21	but Mattitiah, Eliphalehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jehiel and Azaziah were to lead with lyres, according to the sheminith . 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was a master. 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. 
1CH.15.24	The 
1CH.15.25	So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of the thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.15.26	Because God helped the Levites who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.15.27	Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the Ark, and as were the singers and Henaniah the leader of the songs of the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.15.29	As the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.16.1	They brought the Ark of God and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	After David finished offering the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of 
1CH.16.3	He then distributed to everyone in Israel—man and woman alike—to each a loaf of bread, a date cake and a raisin cake. 
1CH.16.4	He appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the Ark of 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was the chief and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom and Jehiel. They were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals, 
1CH.16.6	and the 
1CH.16.7	On that day David first appointed Asaph and his kinsmen to give thanks to 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks to 
1CH.16.9	Sing to Him! Sing praises to Him! Tell of all His wonderful acts. 
1CH.16.10	Glory in His holy Name! Let the heart of those who seek 
1CH.16.11	Seek 
1CH.16.12	Remember the wonders He has done, His signs and judgments of His mouth, 
1CH.16.13	O descendants of Israel His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones! 
1CH.16.14	He is 
1CH.16.15	Remember His covenant forever, the word that He commanded for a thousand generations— 
1CH.16.16	that He made with Abraham, swore to Isaac, 
1CH.16.17	and confirmed in a decree with Jacob to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
1CH.16.18	saying: “To you I give the land of Canaan as your allotted inheritance.” 
1CH.16.19	When you were but a few in number, very few, and strangers in it, 
1CH.16.20	and wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another, 
1CH.16.21	He allowed no one to oppress them, but for their sake He reproved kings: 
1CH.16.22	“Touch not My anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.” 
1CH.16.23	Sing to 
1CH.16.24	Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderous works among all the peoples. 
1CH.16.25	For great is 
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but 
1CH.16.27	Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy are in His place. 
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to 
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to 
1CH.16.30	Tremble before Him, all the earth! The world is firmly established— it will not be moved. 
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations: “
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar and all that is in it. Let the field rejoice and all that is in it. 
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before 
1CH.16.34	Give thanks to 
1CH.16.35	Declare, “Save us, O God of our salvation! Gather and rescue us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy Name, that we may glory in Your praise.” 
1CH.16.36	Blessed be 
1CH.16.37	So David left Asaph and his kinsmen there before the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.16.38	including Obed-edom and his 68 kinsmen. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were gatekeepers. 
1CH.16.39	Also he left Zadok the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings to 
1CH.16.41	Along with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, designated by name to give thanks to 
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for music and other instruments for praising God. The sons of Jeduthun were to be at the gate. 
1CH.16.43	Then all the people departed each one to his home, and David returned to bless his household.
1CH.17.1	After David settled in his place, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Look! I am living in a house of cedar, while the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.” 
1CH.17.3	But that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell David My servant, thus says 
1CH.17.5	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel out to this day. I have gone from tent to tent, and from one dwelling to another. 
1CH.17.6	Wherever I went throughout all Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, “Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?”’ 
1CH.17.7	“So now, say this to My servant David, ‘Thus says 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make your name like the names of the great ones that are in the earth. 
1CH.17.9	I wil establish a place for My people Israel, and plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and shall tremble no more. Violent people will no longer wear them down, as they did formerly, 
1CH.17.10	from the days I ordered judges to be over My people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies.’ “‘Moreover, I declare to you that 
1CH.17.11	It will be that when your days are fulfilled to go with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He will build a house for Me and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me, I will not withdraw My lovingkindness from him, as I withdrew it from the one who ruled before you. 
1CH.17.14	I will appoint him over My House and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.’” 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words and according to all this vision, Nathan spoke to David. 
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and sat before 
1CH.17.17	And this was not enough in Your eyes, O God! You have spoken about the future of Your servant’s household. You have regarded me as the most distinquished of men, 
1CH.17.18	“What more can David say to You for honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant. 
1CH.17.19	, for the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to reveal all Your greatness. 
1CH.17.20	“
1CH.17.21	And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself and to make a Name for Yourself by great and awesome deeds, by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt? 
1CH.17.22	You made Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You, 
1CH.17.23	“Now, 
1CH.17.24	so that it might be established and Your Name might be magnified forever, saying, ‘
1CH.17.25	“You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build a house for him. So Your servant has found courage to pray before You. 
1CH.17.26	Now, 
1CH.17.27	Now You are willing to bless the house of Your servant, so that it may continue forever before You, for it is You, 
1CH.18.1	In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. He took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines. 
1CH.18.2	He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became vassals to David and brought tribute. 
1CH.18.3	Moreover, David defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah at Hamath, when he went to establish his dominion to the Euphrates River. 
1CH.18.4	David captured from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 infantrymen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses but reserved 100 of them for chariots. 
1CH.18.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 of the Arameans. 
1CH.18.6	David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus and the Arameans became subject to David and brought tribute. 
1CH.18.7	David took the gold shields that were on Hadadezer’s servants and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	From Tibhath and from Kun, Hadadezer’s cities, David took a very large quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze sea, pillars and bronze vessels. 
1CH.18.9	When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet and bless him because he fought against Hadarezer and defeated him—for Hadadezer had many wars with Tou. He also sent all kinds of articles of gold, silver and bronze. 
1CH.18.11	King David dedicated these articles to 
1CH.18.12	Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became vassals to David. So 
1CH.18.14	David reigned over all Israel and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was secretary. 
1CH.18.16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were 
1CH.18.17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites, and David’s sons were chief officials in the service of the king.
1CH.19.1	Now in the course of time Nachash king of the Ammonites died and his son became king in his place. 
1CH.19.2	David said: “l will show lovingkindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. But when David’s emissaries came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to console him, 
1CH.19.3	the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you really think that David is honoring your father, by sending messengers to express sympathy? Have not his servants come to you to explore and spy out the country to overthrow it?” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David’s emissaries and shaved them. He cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	When some people came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them for the men were throughly humiliated. The king said: “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow and then return.” 
1CH.19.6	When the children of Ammon realized they had made themselves a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram-naharaim , Aram-maacah and Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	So they hired 32,000 chariots along with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. The children of Ammon also assembled from their cities and moved out to the battle. 
1CH.19.8	On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men. 
1CH.19.9	The children of Ammon came out and took up battle formation at the city gate, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. 
1CH.19.10	When Joab saw that there was a battle line against him both in front and rear, he selected some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans. 
1CH.19.11	He put the rest of the people under the command of his brother Abishai, and arrayed them against the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	He said: “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you will help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	! Take courage for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before his brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem. 
1CH.19.16	After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had the Arameans brought from across the River with Shophah the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. 
1CH.19.17	When David was informed he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came against them and took up positions against them. David took up positions against the Arameans in battle and they fought with him. 
1CH.19.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 infantrymen. He also killed Shophah the commander of the army. 
1CH.19.19	Now when Hadadezer’s vassals saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. Thus the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites. 
1CH.20.1	At the turn of the year, the season when kings go out to war, Joab led out the army and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah, while David remained in Jerusalem. Joab smote Rabbah and left it in ruins. 
1CH.20.2	David took the crown from the head of their king—its weight was found to be a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones—and it was placed on David’s head. He took a vast amount of spoils from the city. 
1CH.20.3	Furthermore, he removed the people who were in it and set them to work with saws, sharp iron tools and axes. Thus he did to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
1CH.20.4	Now it came about after this, that war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and they were subdued. 
1CH.20.5	Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like a weaver’s beam. 
1CH.20.6	Once again there was a battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had 24 fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot. He too also descended from the giants. 
1CH.20.7	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, struck him down. 
1CH.20.8	These were descendants of the giants in Gath; they fell by the hand of David and his servants. 
1CH.21.1	Then satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count Israel. 
1CH.21.2	So David told Joab and the leaders of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan. Then bring me a report so I may know their number.” 
1CH.21.3	But Joab said, “May 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and finally came back to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Joab gave the number of the census of the people to David: in all Israel there were 1,100,000 sword-wielding men; Judah had 470,000 sword-wielding men. 
1CH.21.6	But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king’s word was detestable to Joab. 
1CH.21.7	But God was displeased with this thing and He struck Israel. 
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. But now, I entreat you, take away the guilt of Your servant for I have behaved very foolishly.” 
1CH.21.9	Then 
1CH.21.10	“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says 
1CH.21.11	So Gad went to David and said to him, “Thus says 
1CH.21.12	either three years of famine, or three months being swept away from before your adversaries and the sword of your enemies overtaking you or three days of the sword of 
1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, “I am in a great anguish! Let me fall into the hand of 
1CH.21.14	So 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but while he was doing so, 
1CH.21.16	David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of 
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded to count the people? I alone am the one who sinned and behaved wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand, 
1CH.21.18	So the angel of 
1CH.21.19	So David went up by the word of Gad, which he spoke in the Name of 
1CH.21.20	While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel. His four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
1CH.21.21	When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked up and saw David. He went out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground. 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan: “Give me the site of this threshing floor that I may build an altar to 
1CH.21.23	Then Ornan said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever seems good in his eyes. Look, I will give the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.” 
1CH.21.24	King David said to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for the full price. For I will not take for 
1CH.21.25	So David gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the place. 
1CH.21.26	David built there an altar to 
1CH.21.27	Then 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that 
1CH.21.29	For the Tabernacle of 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to seek God for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, “This is the place where the House of 
1CH.22.2	David gave orders to assemble the foreigners in the land of Israel, and assigned them to be masons to quarry stones to build the House of God. 
1CH.22.3	David supplied an abundance of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for the joints, so much bronze that it could not be weighed, 
1CH.22.4	and cedar logs without number, for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought an abundance of cedar logs to David. 
1CH.22.5	David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced and the House that is to be built for 
1CH.22.6	Then He called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a House for 
1CH.22.7	David said to Solomon, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a House for the name of 
1CH.22.8	But the word of 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son will be born to you who will be a man at rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon and I will confer 
1CH.22.10	He will build a House for My name; he will be My son and I will be His Father. I will establish his royal throne over Israel forever.’ 
1CH.22.11	“Now, my son, may 
1CH.22.12	Only may 
1CH.22.13	Then you will prosper, if you carefully observe the statutes and the ordinances that 
1CH.22.14	“Now behold, with great pain I have provided for the House of 
1CH.22.15	 Moreover, you have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters and every kind of craftsmen skilled in every kind of material—
1CH.22.16	in gold, silver, bronze and iron—beyond number. Arise and work! May 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, 
1CH.22.18	“Is not 
1CH.22.19	Now set your hearts and souls to seek after 
1CH.23.1	When David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel along with the 
1CH.23.3	The Levites 30 years old or more were counted; their head count was 38,000 men. 
1CH.23.4	Of these, there were 24,000 to oversee the work of the House of 
1CH.23.5	 4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 for praising 
1CH.23.6	David organized them into divisions: The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
1CH.23.7	Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the leader, Zetham and Joel—three. 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, Haziel and Haran—three. These were the heads of the clans of Ladan. 
1CH.23.10	The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four. 
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the first and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were enrolled together as a single clan. 
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four. 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron, along with his descendants, was set apart to be consecrated as most holy forever, to burn incense before 
1CH.23.14	But as for Moses the man of God, his sons are named among the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The sons of Gershom: Shebuel, the leader. 
1CH.23.17	The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.

1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died having no sons but only daughters; the sons of Kish, their kinsmen, took them as wives. 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Yeremot—three. 
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi by clans, with the heads of clans as they were enrolled and with a list of their names by heads who carried out the task of avodah in the House of 
1CH.23.25	For David said: “
1CH.23.26	Therefore, the Levites need not carry the Tabernacle and all the vessels for avodah.” 
1CH.23.27	For according to David’s final instructions, the Levites 20 years old and upward were counted. 
1CH.23.28	For their duty was to help the descendants of Aaron in the avodah of 
1CH.23.29	the rows of bread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the 
1CH.23.30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise 
1CH.23.31	and whenever burnt offerings were offered to 
1CH.23.32	They were to keep watch over the Tent of Meeting, the Holy Place and the sons of Aaron their kinsmen for avodah in the House of 
1CH.24.1	Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as 
1CH.24.3	David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them into their offices according to their avodah. 
1CH.24.4	More leading men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, so they divided them: the sons of Eleazar had 16 leaders of clans and the sons of Ithamar had eight leaders of clans. 
1CH.24.5	Thus, they were impartially divided by lot for there were officials of the Holy Place and officials of God, both from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar. 
1CH.24.6	The scribe Shemaiah, son of Nethanel from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the clans of the

1CH.24.31	These also cast lots even as their kinsmen the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech and the heads of the clans of the 
1CH.25.1	Moreover, David and the commanders of the army, set apart for avodah the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun who prophesied with lyres, harps and cymbals. The list of those who performed this work according to their service was: 
1CH.25.2	from the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. The sons of Asaph were under the supervision of Asaph, who prophesied under the hand of the king. 
1CH.25.3	As for Jeduthun, from Jeduthun’s sons: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah and Mattithiah—six, under the charge of their father Jeduthun—who prophesied with the harp, giving thanks and praise to

1CH.27.22	of Dan: Azarel son of Jeroham. These were the officers of the tribes of Israel. 
1CH.27.23	But David did not count those 20 years old and under, because 
1CH.27.24	Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count them, but did not finish. Wrath came upon Israel for this and the number was not entered into the account in the chronicles of King David. 
1CH.27.25	Over the king’s storehouses: Azmaveth son of Adiel. Over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, in the villages and in the citadels: Jonathan son of Uzziah;

1CH.27.32	Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, learned man and scribe. Jehiel son of Hachmoni tutored the king’s sons. 
1CH.27.33	Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Arkite was the king’s friend. 
1CH.27.34	Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah and by Abiatar. Joab was the commander of the king’s army. 
1CH.28.1	Now David assembled all the leaders of Israel in Jerusalem—the tribal officers, the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, and the stewards over all the property and livestock of the king and of his sons, along with the high officials, the mighty warriors and all the men of valor. 
1CH.28.2	Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant of 
1CH.28.3	But God said to me, ‘You will not build a House for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’ 
1CH.28.4	Yet 
1CH.28.5	Moreover, of all my sons—for 
1CH.28.6	“He said to me, ‘Solomon your son will build My House and My courts for I have chosen him to be a son to Me and I will be a father to him. 
1CH.28.7	I will establish his kingdom forever, if he resolutely observes My 
1CH.28.8	Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of 
1CH.28.9	“Now you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for 
1CH.28.10	Consider now, for 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, its houses, its storerooms, its upper rooms, its inner rooms, and the place of atonement; 
1CH.28.12	and the plan of all that he had by the 
1CH.28.13	 also for the divisions of the 
1CH.28.14	For gold, the weight of gold for all vessels of every kind of avodah, and silver, the weight of silver for all vessels for every type of avodah; 
1CH.28.15	and the weight for the gold 
1CH.28.16	also the weight of gold for the tables of the rows of bread, for every table and silver for the silver tables; 
1CH.28.17	and the forks, the basins, and the pitchers of pure gold, and for the golden bowls with the weight for every bowl, and for the silver bowls with the weight for every bowl; 
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense with the weight of refined gold; and gold for the form of the chariot—the 
1CH.28.19	“All this I put in writing is from the hand of 
1CH.28.20	Also David said to his son Solomon: “
1CH.28.21	Now behold, here are the divisions of the 
1CH.29.1	Then King David said to the entire assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced and the task is great, for the palace is not for man but for 
1CH.29.2	Now I have made every effort to prepare for the House of my God gold for the golden objects, silver for silver, copper for copper, iron for iron, and wood for wood; onyx stones and inlay stones, stones of antimony and varigated colors—every kind of precious stones and marble in abundance. 
1CH.29.3	Moreover, in my devotion to the House of my God, I have given over my private treasure of gold and silver to the House of my God, in addition to all that I have already supplied for the holy House: 
1CH.29.4	 3,000 gold talents of gold from Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses—
1CH.29.5	gold for golden objects and silver for silver for all the work—into the hands of craftsmen. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself this day to 
1CH.29.6	Then the leaders of the clans, the officials of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and hundreds and the supervisors over the king’s work contributed willingly. 
1CH.29.7	They gave for the service of the House of God: 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron. 
1CH.29.8	Whoever possessed stones gave them to the treasury of the House of 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced over their freewill offerings because with a whole heart they offered willingly to 
1CH.29.10	David blessed 
1CH.29.11	Yours, 
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honor come from You. You rule over everything. In Your hand is power and might, in Your hand, to magnify and give strength to all. 
1CH.29.13	Now, our God, we give you thanks and praise Your glorious Name. 
1CH.29.14	“But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your hand we have given to You. 
1CH.29.15	For we are sojourners before You, mere transients like our fathers. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, without security. 
1CH.29.16	, all this abundance that we have laid aside to build You a House for Your holy Name is from Your hand; it all belongs to You. 
1CH.29.17	I know, my God, that You search the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. With integrity of heart I have willingly offered all these things. And now I have seen with joy Your people who are present here willingly contribute to You. 
1CH.29.18	, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel our fathers, preserve forever such motives and thoughts in the heart of Your people and make their heart constant toward You. 
1CH.29.19	As for my son Solomon, give him a whole heart to keep Your 
1CH.29.20	Then David said to the whole congregation, “Now bless 
1CH.29.21	The next day, they sacrificed sacrifices to 
1CH.29.22	So they ate and drank before 
1CH.29.23	So Solomon sat on the throne of 
1CH.29.24	All the officials and mighty men, as well as all the sons of King David, pledged their hand in support of King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	 highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had never been on any king before him in Israel. 
1CH.29.26	Now David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	The length of his reign over Israel was 40 years. He reigned in Hebron seven years and he reigned in Jerusalem 33 years. 
1CH.29.28	He died at a good old age, full of days, riches and honor, and his son Solomon became king in his place. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of King David, the first and the last, behold, are written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer 
1CH.29.30	together with all his reign, his power and the events that involved him, Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands. 
2CH.1.1	Now Solomon the son of David firmly established himself over his kingdom. For 
2CH.1.2	Solomon spoke to all Israel—t0 the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the leading patriarchs—
2CH.1.3	and Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the Tent of Meeting of God was there, which Moses the servant of 
2CH.1.4	Now David had brought up the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.5	But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur had made was there in front of the Tabernacle of 
2CH.1.6	So Solomon went up before 
2CH.1.7	That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask! What should I give you?” 
2CH.1.8	Solomon answered God, “You have shown great lovingkindness to my father David and now You have made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	Now, 
2CH.1.10	Now give me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people. For who can govern this great people of Yours?” 
2CH.1.11	Then God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart and you have not asked for riches, possessions or honor, nor for the life of those who hate you and have not even asked for long life but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself—so you can govern My people over whom I have made you king—
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge will be given to you. Moreover, I will give you riches, possessions and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you ever had and none after you will have.” 
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from in front of the Tent of Meeting. So he reigned over Israel. 
2CH.1.14	Solomon accumulated chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the foothills. 
2CH.1.16	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Keve—the king’s merchants purchased them from Keve at a price. 
2CH.1.17	They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 talents of silver and a horse for 150. So by the same means they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
2CH.1.18	Then Solomon vowed to build a House for the Name of 
2CH.2.1	Solomon recruited 70,000 men as carriers, 80,000 as stonecutters in the mountains and 3,600 supervisors over them. 
2CH.2.2	Then Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre saying, “Deal with me as you did with my father David when you sent him cedars to build a house to dwell in. 
2CH.2.3	Behold, I am about to build a House for the Name of 
2CH.2.4	“The House that I am about to build will be great, because our God is greater than all the gods. 
2CH.2.5	But who is able to build Him a House, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him? Who then am I that I should build Him a House—except to burn incense before Him? 
2CH.2.6	“So now, send me a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with the skilled men who are with me, whom my father David provided. 
2CH.2.7	Send me also cedar, evergreen and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber in Lebanon. Indeed my servants will work with yours 
2CH.2.8	to prepare an abundance of timber for me, because the House that I am about to build will be large and magnificent. 
2CH.2.9	Now, behold, I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, 20,000 measures of ground wheat, 20,000 measures of barley, 20,000 vats of wine and 20,000 vats of oil.” 
2CH.2.10	Then King Huram of Tyre, replied in a letter that he sent to Solomon, “Because 
2CH.2.11	Then Huram continued, “Blessed be 
2CH.2.12	So now I am sending Huram-abi—a skilled man endowed with understanding 
2CH.2.13	who is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan and whose father was a man from Tyre—a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, in purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to engrave all kinds of engraving, and who can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled men and with the skilled men of my lord David your father. 
2CH.2.14	Now let my lord send to his servants the wheat and barley, the oil and wine he has promised 
2CH.2.15	and we will cut as many logs from Lebanon as much as you need, and float them in rafts by sea to Jaffa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.” 
2CH.2.16	Solomon counted all the foreign men in the land of Israel, like the census that his father David had taken, and 153,600 were found. 
2CH.2.17	He appointed 70,000 of them to carry loads, 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, and 3,600 overseers to supervise the people working. 
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the House of 
2CH.3.2	He began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. 
2CH.3.3	Now the foundation Solomon laid for the building of the House of God was 60 cubits long and 20 cubits wide, according to the old standard. 
2CH.3.4	The porch in front of the House along its width was 20 cubits and its height was 120 cubits, and the inside was overlaid with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	He paneled the main hall with cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold and embossed on it palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	He adorned the House with precious stones and the gold he used was gold from Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	Furthermore He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls and doors of the House with gold and carved 
2CH.3.8	He made the Holy of Holies, its length corresponding to the width of the House—20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide. He overlaid it with 600 talents of fine gold. 
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 
2CH.3.10	Next he made two sculptured 
2CH.3.11	The wingspan of the 
2CH.3.12	Similarly, one wing of the second 
2CH.3.13	Thus the wingspan of these 
2CH.3.14	Furthermore, he made the veil of blue, purple, crimson yarn and fine linen with 
2CH.3.15	In the front of the House he made two pillars 35 cubits high, each with a capital on the top measuring five cubits. 
2CH.3.16	He made interwoven chains for the inner Sanctuary and put them on top of the pillars. He also made 100 pomegranates and attached them to the chains. 
2CH.3.17	He erected the pillars in front of the Temple, one to the south and the other to the north. The one to the south he named Jachin and the one to the north Boaz. 
2CH.4.1	Moreover, he made a bronze altar 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide and ten cubits high. 
2CH.4.2	He also made the Sea of cast metal ten cubits across from brim to brim, perfectly round. It was five cubits high and its circumference was 30 cubits. 
2CH.4.3	Beneath it, figures like bulls were set all around it, ten cubits encircling the Sea. The bulls were in two rows, cast in one piece with it. 
2CH.4.4	The Sea stood on 12 bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested upon them and their hindquarters were all turned inward. 
2CH.4.5	It was a handbreadth thick, and the brim was like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held 3,000 vats. 
2CH.4.6	He also made ten basins for washing and placed five on the right side and five on the left. In them the items used for the burnt offering were rinsed, but the 
2CH.4.7	Next he made the ten 
2CH.4.8	He also made ten tables and placed them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He also made 100 gold bowls. 
2CH.4.9	Then he made the courtyard of the 
2CH.4.10	He set the Sea on the south side at the southeast corner. 
2CH.4.11	Huram also made the pots, the shovels and the bowls. So Huram-abi finished the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the House of God: 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on the top of the pillars, and the two lattice-works to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, 
2CH.4.13	and the 400 pomegranates for the two lattice-works (two rows of pomegranates for each lattice-work to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars). 
2CH.4.14	He also made the stands, the basins upon the stands, 
2CH.4.15	and the one Sea with the 12 bulls under it, 
2CH.4.16	as well as the pots, the shovels and the meat hooks. All the utensils Huram-abi made for King Solomon for the House of 
2CH.4.17	The king had them cast with clay earth from the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Solomon made all these utensils in such great quantities that the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the House of God, including the golden altar, the tables on which was the Bread of Presence, 
2CH.4.20	the 
2CH.4.21	with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold, the purest gold, 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons and the fire-pans of pure gold, and the doors of the House—the inner doors for the Holy of Holies and the doors of the House, that is, the Temple—were of gold. 
2CH.5.1	When all the work that Solomon undertook for the House of 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon gathered to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the patriarchal leaders of 
2CH.5.3	All the men of Israel gathered together to the king at the feast that is in the seventh month. 
2CH.5.4	So all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the Ark 
2CH.5.5	and brought up the Ark and the Tent of Meeting along with all the sacred furnishings that were in the Tent. The Levitical 
2CH.5.6	Meanwhile, King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who gathered with him before the Ark, were sacrificing so many sheep and bulls that they could not be counted or numbered. 
2CH.5.7	The 
2CH.5.8	The 
2CH.5.9	Now the poles were so long that the ends of the poles extending from the Ark could be seen in front of the inner Sanctuary, though they could not be seen from outside; and they are there to this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where 
2CH.5.11	And it came to pass, when the 
2CH.5.12	all the Levite singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons and their relatives—dressed in fine linen with cymbals, harps and lyres, were standing at the east end of the altar and with them were 120 
2CH.5.13	Then it came to pass that when the trumpeters and singers joined as one to extol and praise 
2CH.5.14	The 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon declared, “
2CH.6.2	I have built You a magnificent House and a place for You to dwell forever.” 
2CH.6.3	Then, while all the congregation of Israel was standing the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel. 
2CH.6.4	He said: “Blessed be 
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a House that My Name might be there. Nor did I choose any man to be a leader over My people Israel. 
2CH.6.6	But I have chosen Jerusalem that My Name would abide there and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ 
2CH.6.7	“Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a House for the Name of 
2CH.6.8	But 
2CH.6.9	Nevertheless, you will not build the House. Rather your son who will be born to you, he will build the House for My Name.’ 
2CH.6.10	“Now 
2CH.6.11	There have I set the Ark in which is the Covenant of 
2CH.6.12	Then he stood before the altar of 
2CH.6.13	For Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high and placed it in the midst of the court. He stood on it and knelt down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven 
2CH.6.14	and he said, “
2CH.6.15	You have kept the promise You made to Your servant David, my father. Surely you spoke with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand—as it is today. 
2CH.6.16	“Now therefore, 
2CH.6.17	“Now therefore, 
2CH.6.18	“But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold—heaven even the highest heaven—cannot contain You. How much less this House that I have built! 
2CH.6.19	Yet attend to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, 
2CH.6.20	that Your eyes may be open toward this House day and night, toward the place where You have said You would put Your Name there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant will pray toward this place. 
2CH.6.21	Hear the supplications of Your servant and Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from Your dwelling place, from heaven, and when You hear, forgive. 
2CH.6.22	“If a man sins against his neighbor and is required to swear an oath, and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this House, 
2CH.6.23	then hear from heaven and act. Judge Your servants, repaying the wicked by bringing down on his own head what he has done and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness. 
2CH.6.24	“If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, yet when they return and confess Your Name, praying and making supplication before You in this House, 
2CH.6.25	then hear from heaven, forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land which You gave to them and to their fathers. 
2CH.6.26	“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, if they pray toward this place and confess Your Name, turning from their sin because You afflicted them, 
2CH.6.27	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel. Indeed may You teach them the good way in which they should walk. Send rain upon Your land that You have given to Your people for an inheritance. 
2CH.6.28	“When there is famine in the land, when there is pestilence, blight, mildew, locust or grasshopper, when their enemies besiege them in the land by their gates, whatever plague or sickness may come, 
2CH.6.29	and any prayer or plea is offered by any individual or by all Your people Israel—each acknowledging his own afflictions and pain, even spreading his hands toward this House—
2CH.6.30	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place and forgive. May You give to every man according to all his ways, as You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of the children of men—
2CH.6.31	so that they will fear You and walk in Your ways all the days that they live in the land that You gave to our fathers. 
2CH.6.32	“Moreover, concerning the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but comes from a distant land for the sake of Your great Name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this House, 
2CH.6.33	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place and do whatever the foreigner asks of You. Then all the peoples of the earth will acknowledge Your Name and revere You, as Your people Israel do, and they will know that this House which I have built is called by Your Name. 
2CH.6.34	“When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and they pray to You toward this city that You have chosen and the House that I have built for Your Name, 
2CH.6.35	then hear from heaven their prayer and their petition, and uphold their cause. 
2CH.6.36	When they sin against You—for there is no man that does not sin —and You become angry with them and hand them over to the enemy who takes them captive to a land far off or near, 
2CH.6.37	when they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and they repent and seek You in the land of their captivity saying, ‘We have sinned, we have committed inquity, we have acted wickedly,’ 
2CH.6.38	“and they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken captive, and they pray toward their land which You gave to their fathers and the city which You have chosen and toward the House which I have built for Your Name, 
2CH.6.39	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions and uphold their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You. 
2CH.6.40	“Now my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open, and let Your ears be attentive to the prayer made in this place. 
2CH.6.41	Now arise, 
2CH.6.42	, do not reject Your anointed one. Remember the loyalty of Your servant David.”
2CH.7.1	Now when Solomon finished praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of 
2CH.7.2	The 
2CH.7.3	When all 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before 
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the House of God. 
2CH.7.6	The 
2CH.7.7	Moreover, Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was before the House of 
2CH.7.8	At that time, Solomon observed the feast for seven days and all Israel with him—a very great assembly from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the feast for seven days. 
2CH.7.10	On the 23rd day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that 
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the House of 
2CH.7.12	Then 
2CH.7.13	If I shut up heaven that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, 
2CH.7.14	when My people, 0ver whom My Name is called, humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
2CH.7.16	For now I have chosen and consecrated this House so that My Name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. 
2CH.7.17	“As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing all that I have commanded you, keeping My statutes and My ordinances, 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to be ruler in Israel.’ 
2CH.7.19	But if you turn away and forsake My decrees and My 
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot them from My land which I gave them, and this House which I have consecrated for My Name I will cast out of My sight. I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
2CH.7.21	As for this House, which is so exalted, every one passing by it shall be appalled and say, ‘Why has 
2CH.7.22	And they will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken 
2CH.8.1	It came to pass at the end of 20 years, during which Solomon built the House of 
2CH.8.2	that he built the cities which Huram had given to him and settled 
2CH.8.3	Then Solomon marched against Hamath-zobah and overpowered it. 
2CH.8.4	He built up Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Bet-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates and bars, 
2CH.8.6	as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen—every thing that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land that he ruled. 
2CH.8.7	All the people that were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, who were not of Israel, 
2CH.8.8	that is, those of their descendants that were left after them in the land, whom 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not make slaves of 
2CH.8.10	These were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250 who ruled over the people. 
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the palace of King David of Israel, because the places where the Ark of 
2CH.8.12	At that time, Solomon offered burnt offerings to 
2CH.8.13	according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for 
2CH.8.14	Following the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the 
2CH.8.15	They did not depart from the king’s commandment to the 
2CH.8.16	Thus all Solomon’s work was carried out from the day of the foundation of the House of 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Elat on the coast of the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram sent him ships commanded by his servants and servants that knew the sea. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir and obtained from there 450 talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions. Accompanied by a large caravan train, including camels carrying an abundance of spices and gold, and precious stones, she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was in her heart. 
2CH.9.2	Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, 
2CH.9.4	as well as the food on his table, the seating of his courtiers, the service and attire of his attendants, his cupbearers and their attire, and his procession with which he went up to the House of 
2CH.9.5	She said to the king: “The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and your wisdom is true. 
2CH.9.6	But I did not believe their reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. And behold, not even half of the greatness of your wisdom was described to me—you surpass the report that I heard! 
2CH.9.7	How blessed are your men, how blessed are your courtiers who continually stand in your presence and hear your wisdom. 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be 
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king 120 gold talents, large quantities of spices and precious stones. There had never been such quantities of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
2CH.9.10	The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algumwood and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	From the sandalwood the king made ramps for the House of 
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for—more than what she had brought to the king. Then she with her courtiers, returned, going back to her own land. 
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that Solomon received in one year was 666 gold talents, 
2CH.9.14	besides what the traders and merchants brought and the gold and silver that all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the region brought to Solomon. 
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made 200 shields of beaten gold, 600 shekels of beaten gold for each shield, 
2CH.9.16	and also 300 shields of beaten gold, 300 shekels of gold for each shield. The king put them in the palace of the Lebanon Forest. 
2CH.9.17	Furthermore, the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne had six steps and a golden footstool attached to it, and arms on each side of the seat. Two lions stood beside the arms 
2CH.9.19	and 12 lions stood on the six steps, one at each end of each step. None like it was ever made for any kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the palace of the Lebanon Forest were of pure gold—silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. 
2CH.9.21	Because the king’s ships sailed to Tarshish with Huram’s servants once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks. 
2CH.9.22	So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to listen to the wisdom that God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	Everyone brought his tribute—vessels of silver, vessels of gold, garments, armor, spices, horses and mules—in the due amount each year. 
2CH.9.25	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen that he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as plentiful as the sycamore trees that are in the foothills. 
2CH.9.28	Horses were brought for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries. 
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, the beginning and the end, are they not written in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Jedo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel 40 years. 
2CH.9.31	Then Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and Rehoboam his son became king in his place. 
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	Now it came to pass that when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard this—for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon—Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	So they sent and summoned him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and spoke to Rehoboam saying, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke grievous but now lighten the harsh labor of your father and his heavy yoke that he put on us—then we will serve you.” 
2CH.10.5	He answered them, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people departed. 
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?” 
2CH.10.7	They answered him saying, “If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
2CH.10.8	But he disregarded the counsel that the elders had given him and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him. 
2CH.10.9	He said to them, “How do you advise me to answer this people who have spoken to me saying, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us?’” 
2CH.10.10	The young men that grew up with him answered him saying: “Speak thus to the people who spoke to you saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us’. Thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins. 
2CH.10.11	Now, whereas my father laid a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will do so with scorpions.’” 
2CH.10.12	Then Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had said to them saying, “Come back to me on the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	The king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam ignored the counsel of the elders 
2CH.10.14	and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men saying, “I will make your yoke heavy—I will make it even heavier. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.” 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God so that 
2CH.10.16	When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king saying, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! To your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own house, David!” So all Israel departed to their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam continued to reign over 
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, but men of Israel pelted him to death with stones. King Rehoboam, however, managed to mount his chariot and to flee to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2CH.11.1	Now when Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem, he assembled the House of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel in order to restore the kingdom back to Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.2	But the word of 
2CH.11.3	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin saying, 
2CH.11.4	‘Thus says 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified cities for defense in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built up Beth-lehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He also strengthened the fortified towns and put commanders in them, along with stores of food, oil and wine. 
2CH.11.12	He also put shields and spears in every town, and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.13	Moreover, the 
2CH.11.14	The Levites even abandoned their pastures and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as 
2CH.11.15	and had appointed his own priests for the high places, for the he-goats and for the calves that he had made. 
2CH.11.16	Those from all the tribes of Israel, who had set their hearts to seek 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years. 
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalat the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. 
2CH.11.19	She bore him sons: Jeush and Shemariah and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Now Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines—for he took 18 wives and 60 concubines and fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters. 
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief and commander among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. 
2CH.11.23	He also wisely dispersed some of his sons throughout the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities and he gave them plenty of food and sought many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	Now it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and he had become strong, that he and all Israel with him forsook the 
2CH.12.2	It so happened that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt marched against Jerusalem—because they had been unfaithful to 
2CH.12.3	with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and innumerable troops that came with him from Egypt: Lybians, Sukkites and Cushites. 
2CH.12.4	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the officers of Judah who had gathered in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says 
2CH.12.6	Then the officers of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “
2CH.12.7	But when 
2CH.12.8	However, they will become subjects to him so that they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the kings of the earth.” 
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the House of 
2CH.12.10	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and entrusted them to the hands of the captains of the royal guard that guarded the entrance to the royal palace. 
2CH.12.11	Whenever the king entered into the House of 
2CH.12.12	Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the anger of 
2CH.12.13	So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned as king. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 17 years in Jerusalem—the city that 
2CH.12.14	But he did evil because he had not set his heart to seek 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, from beginning to end, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer for genealogies? There were continuous wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
2CH.12.16	Then Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. Then his son Abijah became king in his place.
2CH.13.1	In the 18th year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah went into battle with an army of valiant warriors, 400,000 chosen men, while Jeroboam arranged for battle against him 800,000 chosen men, mighty warriors. 
2CH.13.4	Abijah stood on top of Mount Zemaraim, which is a hill of Ephraim, and said, “Listen to me Jeroboam and all Israel! 
2CH.13.5	Don’t you know that 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. 
2CH.13.7	Riffraff and scoundrels gathered around him and pressed hard on Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not stand up to them. 
2CH.13.8	“So now, do you intend to oppose the kingdom of 
2CH.13.9	Have you not banished the 
2CH.13.10	“But as for us, 
2CH.13.11	Every morning and evening they burn to 
2CH.13.12	So look, God is with us at our head, and His 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam had commanded the ambush to go around and come from the rear. So while they were in front of Judah, the ambush was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	When Judah turned around, behold, the battle was before and behind them. They cried out to 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah raised a battle cry, and as the men of Judah shouted, God struck down Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	Then men of Israel fled before Judah and God delivered them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	So Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, and 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain. 
2CH.13.18	Thus men of Israel were subdued at that time, while the children of Judah prevailed—because they relied upon 
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured towns from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. 
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam could not muster strength again in the days of Abijah. Finally 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah grew powerful and took to himself 14 wives and fathered 22 sons and 16 daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the chronicles of the prophet Iddo. 
2CH.13.23	Then Abijah slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Asa became king in his place. During his days the land was untroubled for ten years. 
2CH.14.1	Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of 
2CH.14.2	He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the pillars and cut down the Asherah poles. 
2CH.14.3	He commanded Judah to seek 
2CH.14.4	He also removed the high places and the incense stands out of all the cities of Judah. So the kingdom remained untroubled under him. 
2CH.14.5	He built up fortified cities in Judah, for the land was untroubled and he was not engaged in warfare during those years because 
2CH.14.6	Then he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while the land is still ours because we have sought 
2CH.14.7	Now Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah who bore shields and spears and 280,000 from Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All of these were valiant warriors. 
2CH.14.8	Then Zerah the Cushite marched against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots. When he arrived at Mareshah, 
2CH.14.9	Asa went out to meet him and they arrayed for battle in the valley of Zephath at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	Then Asa cried to 
2CH.14.11	So 
2CH.14.12	and Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So many of the Cushites fell that they could not recover because they were shattered before 
2CH.14.13	They destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the terror from 
2CH.14.14	They also attacked the tents of herdsmen and carried off many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	The 
2CH.15.2	He went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Listen to me Asa, all Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.15.3	For many days Israel was without the true God, without a teaching 
2CH.15.4	But in their distress they turned to 
2CH.15.5	In those times there was no 
2CH.15.6	Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress. 
2CH.15.7	But you, 
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard these words as well as the prophecy of the prophet Oded, he took courage and removed the abominations from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns that he had seized in the hill country of Ephraim. He also repaired 
2CH.15.9	He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, as well as those dwelling with them from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon—for many had defected to him from Israel when they saw that 
2CH.15.10	So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.15.11	On that day they sacrificed to 
2CH.15.12	They entered into a covenant to seek 
2CH.15.13	Whoever would not seek 
2CH.15.14	They also made an oath to 
2CH.15.15	All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their will and He was found by them. Then 
2CH.15.16	He also deposed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from being queen because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her abominable image, crushed it and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
2CH.15.17	Though the high places were not removed from Israel, still Asa’s heart was completely committed to 
2CH.15.18	He brought into the House of God his father’s consecrated articles, as well as his consecrated articles of silver and gold, and utensils. 
2CH.15.19	So there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, King Baasa of Israel marched against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from leaving or coming to King Asa of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	In response, Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the House of 
2CH.16.3	“Let there be a covenant between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with King Baasha of Israel so that he may withdraw from me.” 
2CH.16.4	So Ben-hadad consented to King Asa’s request and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. They ravaged Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	When Baasa heard, he stopped building Ramah and stopped his work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa took up all of Judah to carry away the stones of Ramah and the timber with which Baasa had been building—with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah. 
2CH.16.7	At that time the seer Hanani came to King Asa of Judah and said to him: “Because you have depended on the king of Aram, and not depended on 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Cushites and the Libyans a mighty army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the prison for he was enraged at him for this. Also Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. 
2CH.16.11	Behold, the acts of Asa, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	Now in the thirty-nineth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet. His illness was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek 
2CH.16.13	Finally Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	He was buried in his own tomb, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David. They laid him in his resting place, which was filled with sweet spices and various blended perfumes and they made a very large fire for him. 
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place and took firm hold of his position against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured. 
2CH.17.3	 was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baalim 
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father, and walked in His 
2CH.17.5	So 
2CH.17.6	His heart was devoted to the ways of 
2CH.17.7	Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials—Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah—to teach in the towns of Judah. 
2CH.17.8	With them were the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-adonijah and with them Elishama and Jehoram the 
2CH.17.9	They taught throughout Judah, having with them a 
2CH.17.10	Now the fear of 
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabs also brought him flocks—7,700 rams and 7,700 he-goats. 
2CH.17.12	So Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful. He built forts and storage cities in Judah 
2CH.17.13	and carried out extensive work in the cities of Judah. He had men of war, valiant warriors, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	These were their appointees according to their clans. From Judah, captains of thousands: Adnah the commander with 300,000 valiant warriors; 
2CH.17.15	and next to him Jehohanan the commander with 280,000; 
2CH.17.16	and next to him, Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to 
2CH.17.17	From Benjamin: Eliada a valiant warrior with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield; 
2CH.17.18	and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 equipped for war. 
2CH.17.19	These were the men who served the king besides those whom the king stationed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had wealth and honor in abundance but he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. 
2CH.18.2	Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and bulls for him and the people with him, and urged him to march with him against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.3	King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” He replied, “I am as you are and my people as your people, and we will be with you in battle.” 
2CH.18.4	Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, “Please, let us seek, today, the word of 
2CH.18.5	So the king of Israel assembled the prophets—400 men—and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold off?” They answered, “Go up, for God will give it into the king’s hand!” 
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there another prophet of 
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can inquire of 
2CH.18.8	So the king of Israel called an official and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah quickly!” 
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, wearing their robes, were sitting on their thrones on the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah son of Henaanah made for himself iron horns and declared, “Thus says 
2CH.18.11	All the other prophets were prophesying similarly, saying “March against Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for 
2CH.18.12	Now the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably.” 
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah replied, “As 
2CH.18.14	When he came to the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold off?” He replied, “March and be victorious! They will be given into your hand!” 
2CH.18.15	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the Name of 
2CH.18.16	 So he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and 
2CH.18.17	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies good about me, only evil?” 
2CH.18.18	Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of 
2CH.18.19	And 
2CH.18.20	until a spirit came forward and stood before 
2CH.18.21	He answered, ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You will entice him and you will also succeed. Go and do so.’ 
2CH.18.22	So now, behold, 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah approached Micaiah, slapped him on the cheek and said, “How did the spirit of 
2CH.18.24	Micaiah replied, “Behold, you will see on the day that you go to hide in an inner room.” 
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and turn him over to Amon, governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son, 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this fellow in prison and make him eat the bread and water of affliction—until I return in 
2CH.18.27	Then Micaiah said, “If you ever return in 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah marched against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and they went into the battle. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Aram had already ordered his chariot commanders saying: “Don’t attack anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel alone.” 
2CH.18.31	So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
2CH.18.32	When the chariot commanders realized that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	But a man drew his bow aimlessly and struck the king of Israel between the lower armor and the breastplate. The king said to the charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	The battle raged that day and the king of Israel remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans until dusk. Then at sunset he died.
2CH.19.1	Then King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless, good things are found in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles out of the land and have set your heart to seek God.” 
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba over to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to 
2CH.19.5	He also appointed judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. 
2CH.19.6	He said to the judges. “Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for 
2CH.19.7	Now then, let the fear of 
2CH.19.8	In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, 
2CH.19.9	He charged them saying, “This is how you shall act: in the fear of 
2CH.19.10	When any dispute comes to you from your kinsmen who live in their cities, whether bloodshed, or concerning 
2CH.19.11	“Behold, Amariah the chief 
2CH.20.1	Now it happened after this that the Moabites and the Ammonites together with other Ammonites came to make war against Jehoshaphat. 
2CH.20.2	Some came and reported to Jehoshaphat saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Aram, and are already in Hazazon-Tamar” (that is En-Gedi). 
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was afraid so he resolved to seek 
2CH.20.4	Judah assembled to seek help from 
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the House of 
2CH.20.6	and said: “
2CH.20.7	Are You not our God who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and gave it to the descendants of Your friend Abraham forever? 
2CH.20.8	They settled in it and built You a Temple there for Your Name saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If calamity comes upon us—the sword of judgment, pestilence or famine—we will stand before this House and before You—for Your Name is in this House—and cry to You in our distress and You will hear and deliver us.’ 
2CH.20.10	“Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir—whose land You did not allow Israel to invade when they came from the land of Egypt, instead they turned aside from them and did not destroy them—
2CH.20.11	now behold, how they repay us by coming to drive us out of Your possession that You gave us as an inheritance. 
2CH.20.12	Our God, will You not execute judgment on them? For we have no power to face this great multitude that is attacking us. We do not know what to do—but our eyes are on You.” 
2CH.20.13	All Judah was standing before 
2CH.20.14	Then in the midst of the congregation, the 
2CH.20.15	and he said: “Listen all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat. Thus 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go down against them as they come up the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You will not fight in this battle. Take your positions, stand and see the salvation of 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before 
2CH.20.19	Levites, from the sons of Kohath and the sons of Korah, stood up to praise 
2CH.20.20	Early in the morning they arose and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in 
2CH.20.21	After consulting with the people, he appointed singers to 
2CH.20.22	As they began singing and praising, 
2CH.20.23	For the Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to exterminate and annihilate them. When they had exterminated the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. 
2CH.20.24	When Judah came to the lookout in the wilderness and looked for the multitude, behold, only corpses were lying on the ground—no one had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his people went to take the plunder, they found an abundance of goods, clothing and precious articles, which they pillaged, more than they could carry away. For three days they were taking the plunder because there was so much. 
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Bracha where they blessed 
2CH.20.27	Then every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned joyfully to Jerusalem for 
2CH.20.28	They came to Jerusalem to the House of 
2CH.20.29	So the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the region because they heard that 
2CH.20.30	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was untroubled for his God gave him rest all around.
2CH.20.31	Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was 35 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shlihi. 
2CH.20.32	He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not stray from it, doing what was right in the eyes of 
2CH.20.33	However, the high places were not removed, nor did the people direct their hearts to the God of their fathers. 
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end, behold, they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Israel. 
2CH.20.35	Afterward, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, thereby acting wickedly. 
2CH.20.36	He joined with him to construct ships to go to Tarshish, and they constructed the ships in Ezion-geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, 
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. Jehoram his son became king in his place. 
2CH.21.2	His brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah—all these were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel. 
2CH.21.3	Their father had given them great gifts of silver, gold and precious things, along with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. 
2CH.21.4	Now when Jehoram had risen over his father’s kingdom and made himself strong, he slew all his brothers with the sword, along with some of the officers of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
2CH.21.6	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab’s daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the eyes of 
2CH.21.7	However, 
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom rebelled against Judah’s rule and set up a king over themselves. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram crossed over with his officers and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders. 
2CH.21.10	Thus Edom has been in rebellion against Judah to this day. Then Libnah also revolted from under his hand at that time—because he had forsaken 
2CH.21.11	Moreover, he built high places on the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray.
2CH.21.12	A letter from Elijah the prophet came to him saying: “Thus says 
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, leading Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into prostitution just as the house of Ahab committed prostitution and you have also slain your brothers—your own family, who were better than you—
2CH.21.14	behold, 
2CH.21.15	You yourself will be striken by multiple illnesses of your intestines, day after day, until your intestines drop out because of the illness.” 
2CH.21.16	Then 
2CH.21.17	They rose up against Judah, invaded it and carried away all the possessions found in the royal palace, as well as his sons and his wives. No son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest. 
2CH.21.18	After all this, 
2CH.21.19	and it continued day after day for two years, so that at the end his bowels fell out because of his sickness and he died in great agonies. His people made no fire in his honor like the fire of his fathers. 
2CH.21.20	He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and he passed away, to no one’s regret. He was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 
2CH.22.1	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place for the troops that invaded the camp with the Arabians had slain all the older ones. Thus Ahaziah the son of Jehoram became king over Judah. 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
2CH.22.3	He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab for his mother counseled him to do evil. 
2CH.22.4	He did evil in the sight of 
2CH.22.5	He also followed their counsel when he went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram, 
2CH.22.6	so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought Hazael king of Aram. Then Azariah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he had been wounded. 
2CH.22.7	Now through his coming to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall. Upon his arrival, Ahaziah went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom 
2CH.22.8	So it came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he came upon the officers of Judah and Azaiah’s relatives, who had been attending Azaiah, and slew them. 
2CH.22.9	He then searched for Azaiah who was caught hiding in Samaria. Then they brought him to Jehu, put him to death and buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought 
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah, Azaiah’s mother, saw that her son had died, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshebeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Azaiah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. Because Jehoshebaeath, daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the 
2CH.22.12	He remained hidden with them in the House of God for six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	Now in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and brought the officers of hundreds—Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri—into a covenant with him. 
2CH.23.2	They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leading patriarchs of Israel. They came to Jerusalem 
2CH.23.3	and the entire congregation made a covenant with the king in the House of God. Then he said to them: “Behold, the king’s son! He must reign as 
2CH.23.4	This is what you should do: a third of you, 
2CH.23.5	a third of you shall be in the royal palace, and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the people shall be in the courtyard, and all the people should be in the courtyard of the House of 
2CH.23.6	But let no one enter into the House of 
2CH.23.7	The Levites will surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand, and whoever enters the House, let him be killed. Stay close to the king in his comings and goings.” 
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the 
2CH.23.9	And Jehoiada the 
2CH.23.10	Then he stationed all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand around the king—from the south side of the House to the north side of the House by the altar and by the House. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king’s son and placed upon him the crown and the insignia. They proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and declared, “Long live the king!” 
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the shouting of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people to the House of 
2CH.23.13	She looked, and behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance and the officers and the trumpeters were beside the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments were leading the praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, “Treason, treason!” 
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada the 
2CH.23.15	So they seized her as she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the royal palace and killed her there. 
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people and the king to be the people of 
2CH.23.17	All the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down, smashed its altars and images into pieces, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. 
2CH.23.18	Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the House of 
2CH.23.19	He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the House of 
2CH.23.20	He took the officers of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the House of 
2CH.23.21	and all the people of the land rejoiced. The city was quiet for Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem 40 years. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did what was right in the eyes of 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada took two wives by whom he fathered sons and daughters. 
2CH.24.4	It came to pass after this that Joash had a heart to renovate the House of 
2CH.24.5	He assembled the 
2CH.24.6	So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and asked him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of wicked Athaliah had broken into the House of God, and had even used all the sacred things of the House of 
2CH.24.8	So the king commanded that a box be made and placed outside the gate of the House of 
2CH.24.9	A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to 
2CH.24.10	All the officers and all the people rejoiced, and brought in and cast into the chest until it was full. 
2CH.24.11	Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s officers and when they saw that it was full of money, the royal scribe and the officer of the 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to workmen who carried out the work for the House of 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen labored and the renovation work progressed in their hands. They restored the House of God to its original design, and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	When they had finished, they brought the remainder of the money before the king and Jehoiada and they made it into vessels for the House of 
2CH.24.15	When Jehoiada reached a ripe old age, he died. He was 130 years old when he died. 
2CH.24.16	So he was buried in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good things in Israel and toward God and His House.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	They forsook the House of 
2CH.24.19	 sent prophets to them to bring them back to Him and although they admonished them, they would not listen. 
2CH.24.20	Then the 
2CH.24.21	But they conspired against him, and by order of the king, they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the House of 
2CH.24.22	Thus King Joash disregarded the loyalty which his father Jehoiada had shown to him—and slew Jehoiada’s son. As he was dying, he said: “May 
2CH.24.23	It came to pass that at the turn of the year, the Aramean army came up against him. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem and massacred all the chieftains of the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	Although the Aramean army came with only a small number of men, 
2CH.24.25	When they withdrew from him—for they left him very sick—his own servants plotted against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the 
2CH.24.26	These men conspired against him: Zabad son of Shimiath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Now concerning his sons and the many prophesies against him and the rebuilding of the House of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son became king in his place.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	Now he did what was right in the eyes of 
2CH.25.3	Once he had the kingdom firmly secured under him, he executed his courtiers who had assassinated his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	He did not put their children to death, but acted according to what is written in the 
2CH.25.5	Amaziah gathered together the people of Judah and assigned them according to their clans to officers of thousands and officers of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those from 20 years old and upward, and found 300,000 chosen men, able to go to war, able to handle spear and shield. 
2CH.25.6	He also hired 100,000 valiant warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for 
2CH.25.8	For if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has power to help and to bring down.” 
2CH.25.9	But Amaziah said to the man of God, “And what is to be done about the 100 talents that I have given to the Israelite troops?” The man of God answered, “
2CH.25.10	So, Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim to go back to their homes. Their anger burned greatly against Judah and they returned home in a rage. 
2CH.25.11	Amaziah then took courage and leading his army, marched to the Valley of Salt. He struck down 10,000 men of Seir. 
2CH.25.12	The army of Judah also captured 10,000 alive, and brought them to the top of the cliff. They threw them down from the top of the cliff and everyone fell to their death. 
2CH.25.13	Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and not allowed to go with him to battle raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-Horon. They struck down 3,ooo of them and took considerable spoils.
2CH.25.14	Now after Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he had the gods of the men of Seir brought and installed as his gods. He prostrated himself before them and burned incense to them. 
2CH.25.15	The anger of 
2CH.25.16	But while he was still speaking to him, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you a counselor to the king? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” So the prophet stopped after he said, “Now I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have acted this way and have not listened to my counsel.” 
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent this message to Joash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel saying, “Come, let us meet face to face.” 
2CH.25.18	Joash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah saying: “The thorn bush in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trambled the thorn bush. 
2CH.25.19	You say, ‘Behold, I have defeated Edom.’ So now your heart has become arrogant and proud. Stay home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah with you?” 
2CH.25.20	However, Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God in order that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So King Joash of Israel attacked. He and King Amaziah of Judah confronted one another at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Then Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah—son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz—in Beth-shemesh. Then Joash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim gate to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 
2CH.25.24	He took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the House of God with Obed-edom, together with the treasuries of the king’s palace and the hostages, and returned to Samaria. 
2CH.25.25	Amaziah the son of King Joash of Judah lived 15 years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	From the time that Amaziah turned away from following 
2CH.25.28	Then they brought him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers. 
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king, and he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did what was right in the eyes of 
2CH.26.5	He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding through the visions of God. As long as he sought 
2CH.26.6	He went out and fought the Philistines and breached the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod. He built cities in Ashdod and among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who dwelt in Gur-Baal, and against the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread abroad even to the border of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong. 
2CH.26.9	Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them. 
2CH.26.10	He also built towers in the wilderness and dug out many cisterns because he had much livestock, and he had farmers in the foothills and in the plain and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fertile fields—for he loved the soil. 
2CH.26.11	Uzziah also had a well-trained army ready to go out to battle by divisions, according to the numbers mustered by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under Hananiah, one of the king’s chieftains. 
2CH.26.12	The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600, 
2CH.26.13	and under their command was an army of 307,500 trained for war with mighty power to support the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men to be used on the towers and on the corners to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. So his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he became strong, his heart grew so haughty that he acted corruptly. For he trespassed against 
2CH.26.17	Then Azariah the 
2CH.26.18	They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the 
2CH.26.20	When Azariah the chief 
2CH.26.21	King Uzziah had tza’arat until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house with 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. 
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial that belonged to the kings, for they said: “He had 
2CH.27.1	Jotham was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did what was right in the eyes of 
2CH.27.3	He rebuilt the upper gate of the House of 
2CH.27.4	He also built towns in the Judean hills and forts and towers in the forests. 
2CH.27.5	Jotham also fought the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. That year the Ammonites paid him 100 talents of silver, 10,000 measures of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years. 
2CH.27.6	Jotham became powerful because he ordered his ways before 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	Jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David. Ahaz his son became king in his place. 
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. But he did not do what was right in the eyes of 
2CH.28.2	but followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and even made molten images for the Baalim. 
2CH.28.3	Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom 
2CH.28.4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense in the high places, on the hills and under every leafy tree. 
2CH.28.5	Therefore 
2CH.28.6	In one day, Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 valiant soldiers of Judah—because they had forsaken 
2CH.28.7	Also Zichri, a warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the official in charge of the palace and Elkanah the second to the king. 
2CH.28.8	Men of Israel carried away captive 200,000 of their kinsmen, women, sons and daughters. They also took away a great deal of plunder from them that they brought to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of 
2CH.28.10	So now you intend to bring into bondage the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your male and female slaves? Are you not also guilty of transgressions against 
2CH.28.11	So now, listen to me. Send back the prisoners you have captured from your kinsmen—for the fierce wrath of 
2CH.28.12	Then some of the leaders of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those coming from the campaign, 
2CH.28.13	and said to them, “Do not bring the captives in here, for that would cause us to trespass against 
2CH.28.14	So the soldiers released the captives and the plunder in the presence of the chieftains and the entire congregation. 
2CH.28.15	Then the men designated by name stood up and took the captives, and they clothed all who were naked from the plunder. They gave them clothes and sandals, food and drink, anointed them, led all the feeble ones on donkeys, and brought them back to their kinsmen at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	About that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help. 
2CH.28.17	Once again the Edomites had come and invaded Judah and taken captives, 
2CH.28.18	while the Philistines had raided the towns in the foothills and in the South of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth-shemesh, Aijalon and Gederot, as well as Soho, Timnah and Gimzo with their villages. 
2CH.28.19	For 
2CH.28.20	Tilgat-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him—
2CH.28.21	even though Ahaz plundered the House of 
2CH.28.22	In his time of distress, this same King Ahaz acted even more unfaithfully to 
2CH.28.23	He even sacrificed to the gods of Damascus after he had been defeated, for he said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them and they will help me.” But they caused the downfall of him and all Israel. 
2CH.28.24	Ahaz even collected the utensils of the House of God and cut the utensils of the House of God into pieces. He shut the doors of the House of 
2CH.28.25	In every town of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods—provoking 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	Then Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not brought into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Hezekiah his son became king in his place.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah became king when he was 25 years old, and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	He did right in the eyes of 
2CH.29.3	In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the House of 
2CH.29.4	He brought in the 
2CH.29.5	Then he said to them: “Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the House of 
2CH.29.6	Our fathers acted unfaithfully and did evil in the sight of 
2CH.29.7	They also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or offering any burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore, the wrath of 
2CH.29.9	Behold, for this our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, daughters and wives are in captivity. 
2CH.29.10	“Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with 
2CH.29.11	My sons, now do not be negligent, for 
2CH.29.12	Then these Levites arose: from the sons of Kohath, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah; from the sons of Merari, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the sons of Gershon, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah; 
2CH.29.13	from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
2CH.29.14	from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
2CH.29.15	When they had gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, they went in, as the king ordered according to the words of 
2CH.29.16	So the 
2CH.29.17	They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the porch of 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have purified the entire House of 
2CH.29.19	We have also prepared and concecrated all the articles that King Ahaz discarded in his unfaithfulness, while he was king. Behold, they are now before the altar of 
2CH.29.20	Then King Hezekiah arose early gathered the leaders of the city and went up to the House of 
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary and Judah, and he commanded the 
2CH.29.22	So they slaughtered the bulls and the 
2CH.29.23	The he-goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	The 
2CH.29.25	He stationed the Levites in the House of 
2CH.29.26	So the Levites stood with David’s instruments and the 
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of 
2CH.29.28	The entire congregation prostrated themselves, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished. 
2CH.29.29	Now at the completion of the burnt offering, the king and all who were present with him knelt down and worshiped. 
2CH.29.30	Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah responded and said, “You have now consecrated yourselves to 
2CH.29.32	The number of the burnt offerings that the congregation brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs—all of these as a burnt offering to 
2CH.29.33	The animals consecrated as sacrifices were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 
2CH.29.34	The 
2CH.29.35	There were also a great many burnt offerings, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offering at every burnt offering. Thus the avodah of the House of 
2CH.29.36	Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had enabled the people to accomplish, because it happened so suddenly.
2CH.30.1	Hezekiah then sent word to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the House of 
2CH.30.2	The king and his officials and the entire congregation in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate Passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	For they were not able to celebrate it at the regular time, since not enough 
2CH.30.4	The matter seemed right in the eyes of the king and of the entire community. 
2CH.30.5	So they decided to issue a decree and to proclaim it throughout all Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for 
2CH.30.6	At the king’s command, the couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials saying: “You men of Israel, turn back to 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your fathers and brothers who acted unfaithfully against 
2CH.30.8	Do not stiffen your neck as your fathers did, but reconcile to 
2CH.30.9	For if you return to 
2CH.30.10	As the couriers traveled from town to town through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as Zebulun, they were scorned and mocked. 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless some men from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the officials commanded by the word of 
2CH.30.13	Now a very large assembly gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Matzot in the second month. 
2CH.30.14	They arose and removed the altars and all the incense altars that were in Jerusalem, and threw them into the Kidron Valley. 
2CH.30.15	Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The 
2CH.30.16	They stood at their post as prescribed in the 
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the congregation that had not concecrated themselves, therefore the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone that was not ceremonially clean in order to concecrate them to 
2CH.30.18	Although a great multitude of the people—many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun—had not purified themselves, they still ate the Passover lamb contrary to what is written. But Hezekiah prayed for them saying: “May 
2CH.30.19	every one who prepares his heart to seek 
2CH.30.20	 heard Hezekiah and healed the people. 
2CH.30.21	So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Matzot for seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the 
2CH.30.22	Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who demonstrated good understanding of the service of 
2CH.30.23	Then the whole congregation decided to celebrate seven more days—so for another seven days they celebrated with gladness. 
2CH.30.24	Hezekiah king of Judah contributed 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to the congregation, and the officials contributed 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep to the congregation, and great numbers of 
2CH.30.25	The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced with the 
2CH.30.26	There was great joy in Jerusalem, for nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem since the time of Solomon son of David king of Israel.
2CH.30.27	Then the Levitical 
2CH.31.1	When all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the towns of Judah and smashed the pillars, smashed the Asherah poles and demolished the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as throughout Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all 
2CH.31.2	Then Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the 
2CH.31.3	The king also contributed a portion of his own assets for the burnt offerings: the morning and the evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for 
2CH.31.4	Moreover, he commanded the people, the residents of Jerusalem, to give the portion allotted to the 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the word spread, 
2CH.31.6	The children of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah, also brought in the tithe of bulls and sheep, and the tithe of the sacred things consecrated to 
2CH.31.7	In the third month the heaps began to accumulate and finished in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they blessed 
2CH.31.9	Hezekiah asked the 
2CH.31.10	Azariah the chief 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah ordered them to prepare storerooms in the House of 
2CH.31.12	They faithfully brought in the offerings and the tithes and the consecrated gifts. Conaniah the Levite was the leader in charge over them and Shimei his brother was next in rank. 
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors under Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the leader in charge of the House of God. 
2CH.31.14	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, distributing the offering of 
2CH.31.15	Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah faithfully assisted him in the towns of the 
2CH.31.16	only considering genealogical records, to the males three years old and upward—to all who entered into the House of 
2CH.31.17	to the 
2CH.31.18	The genealogical registry included all their little ones, their wives and sons and daughters of the entire assembly. Thus in their faithfulness they consecrated themselves as holy. 
2CH.31.19	As for the sons of Aaron, the 
2CH.31.20	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah. He did what was good, right and true before 
2CH.31.21	Every work he undertook in the service of the House of God and in the 
2CH.32.1	After these acts of faithfulness, Sen­na­cherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He encamped against the fortified cities, intending to break into them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to wage war against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he consulted with his officers and warriors about blocking the waters of the springs outside the city, and they supported him. 
2CH.32.4	Many people assembled and blocked off all the springs and the raging wadi in the land saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” 
2CH.32.5	Then he took courage and rebuilt the entire wall that had been broken down, raised up the towers, added another outer wall, fortified the Millo in the city of David, and made plenty of weapons and shields. 
2CH.32.6	He also appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate, and encouraged them saying, 
2CH.32.7	“
2CH.32.8	With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is 
2CH.32.9	After this, when King Sennacherib of Assyria, while he and all his forces with him were besieging Lachish, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying: 
2CH.32.10	“Thus says King Sennacherib of Assyria, ‘What are you relying on that you would stay in Jerusalem, under siege? 
2CH.32.11	Is not Hezekiah misleading you, to let you die by famine and thirst, saying, “
2CH.32.12	Has not the same Hezekiah removed His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying, “You shall worship before one altar and upon it you shall burn incense?” 
2CH.32.13	Do not you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands ever able to deliver their land out of my hand? 
2CH.32.14	Who among all the gods of these nations—which my fathers utterly destroyed—could deliver his people from my hand? How then is your God able to deliver you from my hand? 
2CH.32.15	So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or any kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand and from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!’” 
2CH.32.16	His servants spoke further against 
2CH.32.17	Sennacharib also wrote letters reviling 
2CH.32.18	Then they cried out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to terrify and frighten them, in order to capture the city. 
2CH.32.19	They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth made by human hands. 
2CH.32.20	Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven. 
2CH.32.21	Then 
2CH.32.22	Thus 
2CH.32.23	Many brought offerings to 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, but he prayed to 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not respond according to the favor done to him. His heart became haughty, so wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.26	Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride in his heart—both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—so that the wrath of 
2CH.32.27	Now Hezekiah had very abundant riches and honor. He even made treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and for all kinds of valuables, 
2CH.32.28	and storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for the flocks. 
2CH.32.29	Moreover, he built towns and acquired flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very many possessions. 
2CH.32.30	It was also Hezekiah who stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon and channeled them downward to the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah succeeded in all that he did. 
2CH.32.31	But when the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone to test him, to know all that was in his heart.
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	So Hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. His son Manasseh became king in his place.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king, and he reigned 55 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	He did evil in the sight of 
2CH.33.3	For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had demolished, he reerected altars for the Baalim, made Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the host of heaven and worshipped them. 
2CH.33.4	He built altars in the House of 
2CH.33.5	He also built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the House of 
2CH.33.6	Furthermore, he made his children pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom and practiced witchcraft, divination and sorcery, and consulted ghosts and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of 
2CH.33.7	Then he placed the carved image of the idol that he had made in the House of God—of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this House and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name forever. 
2CH.33.8	I will never again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for their fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them—all the 
2CH.33.9	But Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations whom 
2CH.33.10	 spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
2CH.33.11	Therefore, 
2CH.33.12	In his distress, he entreated 
2CH.33.13	When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty, heard his plea and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that 
2CH.33.14	Afterward he built an outer wall to the city of David west of Gihon in the valley, as far as the entrance to the Fish Gate, and encircling the Ophel; he also raised it up much higher. He stationed military officers in all the fortified cities of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	He also removed the foreign gods and idols from the House of 
2CH.33.16	He rebuilt the altar of 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the Name of 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and how God was moved by his entreaty, all his sin and his unfaithfulness, and the sites on which he built high places and erected the Asherah poles and the carved images before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the records of Hozai. 
2CH.33.20	Manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house. His son Amon became king in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	He did what was evil in the sight of 
2CH.33.23	He did not humble himself before 
2CH.33.24	So his servants conspired against him and assassinated him in his own house. 
2CH.33.25	Then the people of the land struck down all who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	He did right in the eyes of 
2CH.34.3	In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek after the God of his father David. In the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the Asherah poles, and the carved and molten images. 
2CH.34.4	They tore down the altars of the Baal in his presence and chopped down the sun-images that were above them. Also the Asherah poles and the carved and molten images he smashed into pieces, ground into dust, and scattered upon the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars—so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, with their surrounding ruins, 
2CH.34.7	he broke down the altars, the Asherah poles, crushed the carved images into powder, and chopped down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, after purging the land and the House, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the House of 
2CH.34.9	They came to Hilkiah the 
2CH.34.10	Then they put it in the hands of the workmen who were in charge of the House of 
2CH.34.11	They in turn gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone as well as timber—for joining and making beams—for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let fall into ruin. 
2CH.34.12	The men did the work faithfully. Over them were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, Levites from the sons of Merari, along with Zechariah and Meshullam from the sons of Kohath, to supervise, while other Levites—all skilled musicians—
2CH.34.13	were over the burden-bearers and supervised all who worked from task to task. Some of the Levites were also scribes, overseers and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	While they were bringing out the silver that had been brought into the House of 
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah responded by telling Shaphan the scribe, “I have found a scroll of the 
2CH.34.16	Then Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and moreover returned a report to the king, saying, “Your servants are doing everything that was committed to them. 
2CH.34.17	They have melted down the silver that was found in the House of 
2CH.34.18	Shaphan the scribe also said to the king, “Hilkiah the 
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the 
2CH.34.20	The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, 
2CH.34.21	“Go! Inquire of 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah, and those whom the king commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokahath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe—now she was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter—and spoke to her about this. 
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “Thus says 
2CH.34.24	“Thus says 
2CH.34.25	For they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods in order to provoke Me with all the works of their hands. Therefore, My wrath will be poured out upon this place and it will not be quenched.’” 
2CH.34.26	But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of 
2CH.34.27	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against the inhabitants , and you humbled yourself before Me, tore your clothes, and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ says 
2CH.34.28	‘Behold, I will gather you to your fathers and you will be buried in your grave in 
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	The king went up to the House of 
2CH.34.31	Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before 
2CH.34.32	Moreover, he made all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin stand with him. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
2CH.34.33	Josiah removed all the abominations from the whole territory of 
2CH.35.1	Josiah celebrated Passover unto 
2CH.35.2	He reinstated the 
2CH.35.3	He said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were consecrated to 
2CH.35.4	Prepare youselves by your ancestral houses in your divisions, according to the writing of King David of Israel and according to the writing of his son Solomon. 
2CH.35.5	Stand in the holy place by the divisions of the ancestral houses, by sons of the people and by divisions of ancestral houses of the Levites. 
2CH.35.6	Now sanctify yourselves, slaughter the Passover lamb and prepare it for your kinsmen, according to the word of 
2CH.35.7	Josiah provided for all the people who were present, flocks of lambs and goats totaling 30,000, all for the Passover offerings, as well as 3,000 bulls—all from the king’s possessions. 
2CH.35.8	His officials also gave a freewill offering to the people, the 
2CH.35.9	Likewise, Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethaniel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, leaders of the Levites, provided 5,000 Passover lambs for the Levites and 500 bulls. 
2CH.35.10	So the avodah was prepared and the 
2CH.35.11	They slaughtered the Passover lambs and while the 
2CH.35.12	Then they removed the portions to be burnt to give them to the divisions of ancestral houses of the people to present to 
2CH.35.13	They roasted the Passover lambs with fire according to the ordinance, then boiled the sacred parts in pots, caldrons and pans, and brought them quickly to all the people. 
2CH.35.14	Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the 
2CH.35.15	The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun, the king’s seer. The gatekeepers were at every gate. They did not need to depart from their posts for their fellow Levites provided for them. 
2CH.35.16	So on that day the entire service of 
2CH.35.17	The 
2CH.35.18	Passover had not been celebrated like that in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet, and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the 
2CH.35.19	This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah. 
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had set the House in order, King Neco of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates and Josiah went out to engage him. 
2CH.35.21	But Neco sent messengers to him saying, “What is there between me and you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today but against the house that wars with me and God has ordered me to hurry. Stop for your sake from meddling with God who is with me, so that He will not destroy you!” 
2CH.35.22	Josiah, however, would not turn away from him but disguised himself in order to fight him. He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God and went to fight him in the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	Archers shot King Josiah and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am seriously wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So his servants carried him out of the chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had. They brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned over Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	Now Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the singers, male and female, commemorated Josiah in their laments. And they made them an ordinance in Israel and behold, they are written in the lamentations. 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the 
2CH.35.27	and his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in Jerusalem in his father’s place. 
2CH.36.2	Joahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	The king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and imposed a fine on the land of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt made Eliakim, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. 
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of 
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched against him and bound him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the vessels of the House of 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the detestable things he did, and all that was found against him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. 
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of 
2CH.36.10	At the turn of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent and had him brought to Babylon along with the precious articles from the House of 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.12	He did evil in the sight of 
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him take an oath by God. He also stiffened his neck and hardened his heart so as not to turn to 
2CH.36.14	Furthermore, all the leading 
2CH.36.15	, the God of their fathers, sent word to them through His messengers again and again, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. 
2CH.36.16	But they mocked the messengers of God and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets until the wrath of 
2CH.36.17	Therefore He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the House of their Temple. He had no pity on young man or virgin, elderly or infirm—He gave them all into his hand. 
2CH.36.18	All the vessels of the House of God, large and small, and the treasures of the House of 
2CH.36.19	They burned the House of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all the palaces with fire and destroyed everything of value. 
2CH.36.20	He exiled to Babylon those who had escaped the sword and they became slaves to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia—
2CH.36.21	in fulfillment of the word of 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of King Cyrus of Persia—fulfilling the word of 
2CH.36.23	“Thus says King Cyrus of Persia ‘
MAT.1.1	The book of the genealogy of 
MAT.1.2	Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers, 
MAT.1.3	Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Ram, 
MAT.1.4	Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon, 
MAT.1.5	Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse, 
MAT.1.6	and Jesse fathered David the king. David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 
MAT.1.7	Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asa, 
MAT.1.8	Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah, 
MAT.1.9	Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah, 
MAT.1.10	Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, Amon fathered Josiah, 
MAT.1.11	and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. 
MAT.1.12	After the Babylonian exile Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel, 
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor, 
MAT.1.14	Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud, 
MAT.1.15	Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, Matthan fathered Jacob, 
MAT.1.16	and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Miriam, from whom was born 
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the Babylonian exile are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian exile until the Messiah are fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of 
MAT.1.19	And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, made up his mind to dismiss her secretly. 
MAT.1.20	But while he considered these things, behold, an angel of 
MAT.1.21	She will give birth to a son; and you shall call His name 
MAT.1.22	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by 
MAT.1.23	“Behold, the virgin shall conceive and give birth to a son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which means “God with us.” 
MAT.1.24	When Joseph woke up from his sleep, he did as the angel of 
MAT.1.25	But he did not know her intimately until she had given birth to a Son. And he called His name 
MAT.2.1	Now after 
MAT.2.2	saying, “Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.” 
MAT.2.3	When King Herod heard, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 
MAT.2.4	And when he had called together all the ruling 
MAT.2.5	So they told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written by the prophet: 
MAT.2.6	‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come a ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.’” 
MAT.2.7	Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star had appeared. 
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the Child. And when you have found Him, bring word back to me so that I may come and worship Him as well.” 
MAT.2.9	After listening to the king, they went their way. And behold, the star they had seen in the east went on before them, until it came to rest over the place where the Child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great gladness. 
MAT.2.11	And when they came into the house, they saw the Child with His mother Miriam; and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another way.
MAT.2.13	Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of 
MAT.2.14	So he got up, took the Child and His mother during the night, and went to Egypt. 
MAT.2.15	He stayed there until Herod’s death. This was to fulfill what was spoken by 
MAT.2.16	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became furious. And he sent and killed all boys in Bethlehem and in all its surrounding area, from two years old and under, according to the time he had determined from the magi. 
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.2.18	“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and loud wailing, Rachel sobbing for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.” 
MAT.2.19	But when Herod died, behold, an angel of 
MAT.2.20	saying, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those seeking the Child’s life are dead.” 
MAT.2.21	So he got up, took the Child and His mother, and went to the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But hearing that Archelaus was king of Judea in place of his father Herod, he became afraid to go there. Then after being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of the Galilee. 
MAT.2.23	And he went and lived in a city called Natzeret, to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that 
MAT.3.1	In those days, John the Immerser came proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea, 
MAT.3.2	“Turn away from your sins, for the kingdom of heaven is near!” 
MAT.3.3	For he is the one Isaiah the prophet spoke about, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of 
MAT.3.4	Now John wore clothing from camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan. 
MAT.3.6	Confessing their sins, they were being immersed by him in the Jordan River. 
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
MAT.3.8	Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance; 
MAT.3.9	and do not think that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’! For I tell you that from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
MAT.3.10	Already the axe is laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire! 
MAT.3.11	“As for me, I immerse you in water for repentance. But the One coming after me is mightier than I am; I am not worthy to carry His sandals. He will immerse you in the 
MAT.3.12	His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He shall clear His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn; but the chaff He shall burn up with inextinguishable fire.”
MAT.3.13	Then 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be immersed by You, and You are coming to me?” 
MAT.3.15	But 
MAT.3.16	After being immersed, 
MAT.3.17	And behold, a voice from the heavens said, “This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased!”
MAT.4.1	Then 
MAT.4.2	After He had fasted for forty days and forty nights, He was hungry. 
MAT.4.3	And when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are 
MAT.4.4	But He replied, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took Him into the holy city and placed Him on the highest point of the Temple. 
MAT.4.6	“If You are 
MAT.4.7	 said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil takes Him to a very high mountain and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
MAT.4.9	And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.” 
MAT.4.10	Then 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil leaves Him. And behold, angels came and began to take care of Him. 
MAT.4.12	Now when 
MAT.4.13	Leaving Natzeret, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
MAT.4.14	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.4.15	“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations— 
MAT.4.16	the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and those sitting in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned.” 
MAT.4.17	From then on, 
MAT.4.18	Now as 
MAT.4.19	And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” 
MAT.4.20	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 
MAT.4.21	Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and He called them. 
MAT.4.22	Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him. 
MAT.4.23	 was going throughout all the Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people. 
MAT.4.24	News about Him spread throughout all Syria. And they brought to Him all the sick—those tormented by various diseases and afflictions, those plagued by demons, the epileptics, the paralyzed—and He healed them. 
MAT.4.25	And large crowds followed Him from the Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
MAT.5.1	Now when 
MAT.5.2	And He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying, 
MAT.5.3	“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.4	“Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. 
MAT.5.5	“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 
MAT.5.6	“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. 
MAT.5.7	“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy. 
MAT.5.8	“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 
MAT.5.9	“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. 
MAT.5.10	“Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.11	“Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, on account of Me. 
MAT.5.12	Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great! For in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.” 
MAT.5.13	“You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt should lose its flavor, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. 
MAT.5.14	“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. 
MAT.5.15	Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so it gives light to all in the house. 
MAT.5.16	In the same way, let your light shine before men so they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.” 
MAT.5.17	“Do not think that I came to abolish the 
MAT.5.18	Amen, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or serif shall ever pass away from the 
MAT.5.19	Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever keeps and teaches them, this one shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.20	For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees and 
MAT.5.21	“You have heard it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and whoever commits murder shall be subject to judgment.’ 
MAT.5.22	But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘
MAT.5.23	“Therefore if you are presenting your offering upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 
MAT.5.24	leave your offering there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering. 
MAT.5.25	“Make friends quickly with your opponent while you are with him on the way. Otherwise, your opponent may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the assistant, and you will be thrown into prison. 
MAT.5.26	Amen, I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last penny! 
MAT.5.27	“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 
MAT.5.28	But I tell you that everyone who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
MAT.5.29	And if your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away! It is better for you that one part of your body should be destroyed, than that your whole body be thrown into Gehenna. 
MAT.5.30	And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you that one part of your body should be destroyed, than that your whole body go into Gehenna. 
MAT.5.31	“It was said, ‘Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ 
MAT.5.32	But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 
MAT.5.33	“Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall carry out your oaths to 
MAT.5.34	But I tell you, do not swear at all—not by heaven, for it is the throne of God; 
MAT.5.35	or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 
MAT.5.36	And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 
MAT.5.37	But let your word ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No’—anything more than this is from the evil one.”
MAT.5.38	“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ 
MAT.5.39	But I tell you, do not resist an evildoer. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other. 
MAT.5.40	And the one wanting to sue you and to take your shirt, let him also have your coat. 
MAT.5.41	Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. 
MAT.5.42	Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. 
MAT.5.43	“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 
MAT.5.44	But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 
MAT.5.45	so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 
MAT.5.46	For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don’t they? 
MAT.5.47	And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than anyone else? Even the pagans do that, don’t they? 
MAT.5.48	Therefore be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.”
MAT.6.1	“Beware of practicing your righteousness before others to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. 
MAT.6.2	So whenever you do 
MAT.6.3	But when you do 
MAT.6.4	so that your 
MAT.6.5	“When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Amen, I tell you, they have their reward in full! 
MAT.6.6	But you, when you pray, go into your inner room; and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, shall reward you. 
MAT.6.7	And when you are praying, do not babble on and on like the pagans; for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 
MAT.6.8	Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. 
MAT.6.9	“Therefore, pray in this way: ‘Our Father in heaven, sanctified be Your name. 
MAT.6.10	Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. 
MAT.6.11	Give us this day our daily bread. 
MAT.6.12	And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. 
MAT.6.13	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’ 
MAT.6.14	“For if you forgive others their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 
MAT.6.15	But if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive your transgressions. 
MAT.6.16	“And whenever you fast, do not become sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they neglect their faces to make their fasting evident to men. Amen, I tell you, they have their reward in full! 
MAT.6.17	But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 
MAT.6.18	so that your fasting won’t be evident to men, but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you. 
MAT.6.19	“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. 
MAT.6.20	But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal. 
MAT.6.21	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
MAT.6.22	“The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. 
MAT.6.23	But if your eye is bad, your body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! 
MAT.6.24	“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick by one and look down on the other. You cannot serve God and money.” 
MAT.6.25	“So I say to you, do not worry about your life—what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing? 
MAT.6.26	“Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns; yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 
MAT.6.27	And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 
MAT.6.28	And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin. 
MAT.6.29	Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. 
MAT.6.30	Now if in this way God clothes the grass—which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow—will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 
MAT.6.31	“Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 
MAT.6.32	For the pagans eagerly pursue all these things; yet your Father in heaven knows that you need all these. 
MAT.6.33	But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. 
MAT.6.34	Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”
MAT.7.1	“Stop judging, so that you may not be judged. 
MAT.7.2	For with the judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 
MAT.7.3	“Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam in your own eye? 
MAT.7.4	Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and look, the beam is in your own eye? 
MAT.7.5	Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye. 
MAT.7.6	“Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet, then turn and rip you to shreds. 
MAT.7.7	“Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. 
MAT.7.8	For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it shall be opened. 
MAT.7.9	“For what man among you, when his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? 
MAT.7.10	Or when he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 
MAT.7.11	If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! 
MAT.7.12	So in all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you—for this is the 
MAT.7.13	“Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many. 
MAT.7.14	How narrow is the gate and difficult the way that leads to life, and those who find it are few.”
MAT.7.15	“Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 
MAT.7.16	You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes aren’t gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, are they? 
MAT.7.17	Even so, every good tree produces good fruit, but the rotten tree produces bad fruit. 
MAT.7.18	A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	Every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. 
MAT.7.20	So then, you will recognize them by their fruit. 
MAT.7.21	“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord!’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 
MAT.7.22	Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in Your name, and drive out demons in Your name, and perform many miracles in Your name?’ 
MAT.7.23	Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Get away from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’”
MAT.7.24	“Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 
MAT.7.25	And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house; and yet it did not fall, for its foundation had been built on the rock. 
MAT.7.26	Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 
MAT.7.27	And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.” 
MAT.7.28	Now when 
MAT.7.29	for He was teaching them as one having authority and not as their 
MAT.8.1	When He came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. 
MAT.8.2	And a man with 
MAT.8.3	 stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be cleansed.” Immediately his 
MAT.8.4	And 
MAT.8.5	Now when 
MAT.8.6	“Master,” he said, “my servant is lying at home paralyzed, horribly tormented.” 
MAT.8.7	 said to him, “I’ll come and heal him.” 
MAT.8.8	But the centurion said, “Master, I’m not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 
MAT.8.10	Now when 
MAT.8.11	Moreover, I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and they will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.8.12	But the sons of the kingdom will be driven out into the outer darkness; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 
MAT.8.13	Then 
MAT.8.14	And when 
MAT.8.15	 touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to take care of Him. 
MAT.8.16	When evening came, the people brought to Him many who were afflicted by demons. He forced out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. 
MAT.8.17	So was fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He Himself took our sicknesses and carried away our diseases.” 
MAT.8.18	Now when 
MAT.8.19	Then a 
MAT.8.20	 tells him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” 
MAT.8.21	Then another of the disciples said, “Master, first let me go and bury my father.” 
MAT.8.22	But 
MAT.8.23	As He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 
MAT.8.24	Suddenly a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves. But 
MAT.8.25	So they came and woke Him up, saying, “Master, save us! We’re perishing!” 
MAT.8.26	He said to them, “Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became totally calm. 
MAT.8.27	The men were amazed, saying, “What kind of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!” 
MAT.8.28	When He came to the other side, into the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-plagued men coming from the graveyard met Him. They were so violent that no one could pass by that way. 
MAT.8.29	And they screamed, “What’s between You and us, 
MAT.8.30	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding some distance away from them. 
MAT.8.31	The demons kept begging Him, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 
MAT.8.32	And He told them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned. 
MAT.8.33	The herdsmen ran away, went into the town, and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-plagued men. 
MAT.8.34	The whole town came out to meet 
MAT.9.1	After getting into a boat, 
MAT.9.2	Just then, some people brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a cot. And seeing their faith, 
MAT.9.3	Then some of the 
MAT.9.4	And knowing their thoughts, 
MAT.9.5	For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 
MAT.9.6	But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins...” Then He tells the paralyzed man, “Get up, take your cot and go home.” 
MAT.9.7	And he got up and went home. 
MAT.9.8	When the crowd saw it, they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
MAT.9.9	As 
MAT.9.10	Now it happened that when 
MAT.9.11	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, “Why does this Teacher of yours eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 
MAT.9.12	But when He heard this, 
MAT.9.13	Now go and learn what this means: ‘Mercy I desire, and not sacrifice.’ For I didn’t come to call the righteous, but the sinful.”
MAT.9.14	Then John’s disciples came to Him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?” 
MAT.9.15	And 
MAT.9.16	“And no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment and a worse tear happens. 
MAT.9.17	Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the skins burst, and the wine spills out and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”
MAT.9.18	Just as He was saying these things to them, a synagogue leader came and began to bow before Him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come lay Your hand on her and she will live.” 
MAT.9.19	And 
MAT.9.20	Just then a woman, losing blood for twelve years, came from behind and touched the 
MAT.9.21	For she kept saying to herself, “If only I touch His garment, I will be healed.” 
MAT.9.22	But then 
MAT.9.23	When 
MAT.9.24	He said, “Go away, for the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.” And they began jeering at Him. 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd had been cleared out, He went in and took her hand, and the girl got up. 
MAT.9.26	And news of this spread all around that region. 
MAT.9.27	As 
MAT.9.28	When He went into the house, the blind men came to Him. And 
MAT.9.29	Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith, let it be done for you.” 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. And 
MAT.9.31	But they went out and spread the news about Him all around that region. 
MAT.9.32	As they were going out, a mute man plagued by a demon was brought to Him. 
MAT.9.33	After the demon was driven out, the mute man started speaking. The crowds were astounded, saying, “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!” 
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees were saying, “By the prince of demons He drives out demons.” 
MAT.9.35	Now 
MAT.9.36	When He saw the crowds, He felt compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 
MAT.9.38	Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He may send out workers into His harvest field.”
MAT.10.1	 summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so they could drive them out and heal every kind of disease and sickness. 
MAT.10.2	Now these are the names of the twelve emissaries: first, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother; 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; Jacob, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Zealot, and Judah the man from Kriot, the one who also betrayed Him. 
MAT.10.5	 sent out these twelve and ordered them, “Do not go to the Gentiles, and do not enter into any Samaritan town. 
MAT.10.6	But go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.10.7	As you go, proclaim, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near!’ 
MAT.10.8	Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with 
MAT.10.9	Do not get gold or silver or copper for your money belts, 
MAT.10.10	or a bag for the journey, or two shirts, or sandals, or a walking stick; for the worker is entitled to his food. 
MAT.10.11	“Whatever town or village you shall enter, find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave. 
MAT.10.12	As you come into the house, greet it. 
MAT.10.13	If the household is worthy, let your 
MAT.10.14	And whoever will not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or that town, shake the dust off your feet. 
MAT.10.15	Amen, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than for that town. 
MAT.10.16	“Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. 
MAT.10.17	But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and flog you in their synagogues. 
MAT.10.18	You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me, as a witness to them and to the Gentiles. 
MAT.10.19	But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you should say, for it shall be given to you in that hour what you should say. 
MAT.10.20	For it is not you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 
MAT.10.21	“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death. 
MAT.10.22	And you will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end shall be saved. 
MAT.10.23	Whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. Amen, I tell you, you will never finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 
MAT.10.24	“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. 
MAT.10.25	It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! 
MAT.10.26	“So do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be made known. 
MAT.10.27	What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in your ear, proclaim from the housetops! 
MAT.10.28	And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. 
MAT.10.29	“Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them shall fall to the ground apart from your Father’s consent. 
MAT.10.30	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 
MAT.10.31	So do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows. 
MAT.10.32	“Therefore whoever acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.10.33	But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.10.34	“Do not think that I came to bring 
MAT.10.35	For I have come to set ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
MAT.10.36	and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.’ 
MAT.10.37	“He who loves father or mother more than Me isn’t worthy of Me, and he who loves son or daughter more than Me isn’t worthy of Me. 
MAT.10.38	And whoever does not take up his cross and follow after Me isn’t worthy of Me. 
MAT.10.39	He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it. 
MAT.10.40	“He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me. 
MAT.10.41	He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward, and he who receives a 
MAT.10.42	And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, 
MAT.11.1	When 
MAT.11.2	Now when John heard in prison about the works of the Messiah, he sent word through his disciples 
MAT.11.3	and said to 
MAT.11.4	 replied, “Go report to John what you hear and see: 
MAT.11.5	the blind see and the lame walk, those with 
MAT.11.6	Blessed is the one who is not led to stumble because of Me.”
MAT.11.7	Now as they were leaving, 
MAT.11.8	No? So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in finery? Look, those who wear finery are in the palaces of kings! 
MAT.11.9	Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, even more than a prophet. 
MAT.11.10	This is the one about whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way before You.’ 
MAT.11.11	“Amen, I tell you, among those born of women, none has arisen greater than John the Immerser. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
MAT.11.12	From the days of John the Immerser until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated with violence, and the violent grasp hold of it. 
MAT.11.13	For all the prophets and the 
MAT.11.14	And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. 
MAT.11.15	He who has ears, let him hear! 
MAT.11.16	“But to what shall I compare this generation? It’s like children sitting in the marketplaces who call to one other, saying, 
MAT.11.17	‘We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We wailed, but you did not mourn.’ 
MAT.11.18	“For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ 
MAT.11.19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.” 
MAT.11.20	Then 
MAT.11.21	“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have turned long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
MAT.11.22	Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgment than for you. 
MAT.11.23	And you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will go down to 
MAT.11.24	Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you.”
MAT.11.25	At that time 
MAT.11.26	Yes, Father, for this way was pleasing to You. 
MAT.11.27	“All things have been handed over to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. 
MAT.11.28	Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
MAT.11.29	Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and ‘you will find rest for your souls.’ 
MAT.11.30	For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” 
MAT.12.1	At that time 
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not permitted on Shabbat.” 
MAT.12.3	But He said to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he became hungry, and those with him? 
MAT.12.4	How he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not permitted for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the 
MAT.12.5	Or haven’t you read in the 
MAT.12.6	But I tell you that something greater than the Temple is here. 
MAT.12.7	If you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you wouldn’t have condemned the innocent. 
MAT.12.8	For the Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat.” 
MAT.12.9	Leaving from there, He went into their synagogue. 
MAT.12.10	A man with a withered hand was there. And so that they might accuse Him, they questioned 
MAT.12.11	He said to them, “What man among you will not grab his sheep and lift it out, if it falls into a pit on Shabbat? 
MAT.12.12	How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is permitted to do good on Shabbat.” 
MAT.12.13	Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out and it was restored, as healthy as the other. 
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him, how they might destroy Him.
MAT.12.15	Knowing this, 
MAT.12.16	And He sternly warned them not to make Him known. 
MAT.12.17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.12.18	“Here is My servant whom I chose, the One I love, in whom My soul takes delight. I will put My 
MAT.12.19	He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets. 
MAT.12.20	A crushed reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, until He brings forth justice to victory. 
MAT.12.21	And in His name the nations shall hope.” 
MAT.12.22	Then a demon-plagued man, who was blind and mute, was brought to 
MAT.12.23	All the crowds were astounded and saying, “This can’t be 
MAT.12.24	But hearing this, the Pharisees said, “This fellow drives out demons only by beelzebul, the ruler of demons.” 
MAT.12.25	Knowing their thoughts, 
MAT.12.26	If satan drives out satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? 
MAT.12.27	And if I drive out demons by beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason, they will be your judges. 
MAT.12.28	But if I drive out demons by the 
MAT.12.29	Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and carry off his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he will thoroughly plunder his house. 
MAT.12.30	He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. 
MAT.12.31	“For this reason I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the 
MAT.12.32	Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the 
MAT.12.33	“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for the tree is known by its fruit. 
MAT.12.34	You brood of vipers! How can you who are evil say anything good? For from the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks. 
MAT.12.35	The good man from his good treasury brings forth good, and the evil man from his evil treasury brings forth evil. 
MAT.12.36	But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment, men will give account for every careless word they speak. 
MAT.12.37	For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
MAT.12.38	Then some of the 
MAT.12.39	But 
MAT.12.40	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 
MAT.12.41	The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here. 
MAT.12.42	The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here. 
MAT.12.43	“Now when an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places looking for rest and doesn’t find it. 
MAT.12.44	Then it says, ‘I’ll go back home where I came from.’ And when it comes, it finds the house vacant, swept clean, and put in order. 
MAT.12.45	Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. And that man’s last condition becomes worse than the first. So also will it be for this evil generation.” 
MAT.12.46	While 
MAT.12.47	Someone said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, trying to speak to You.” 
MAT.12.48	But to the one telling Him this, 
MAT.12.49	Stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers. 
MAT.12.50	For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother.”
MAT.13.1	On that day after 
MAT.13.2	And large crowds gathered around Him; so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	And He told them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, a sower went out to spread some seed. 
MAT.13.4	As he was scattering the seed, some seeds fell by the road; and the birds came and ate them up. 
MAT.13.5	Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil. They sprang up immediately, because the soil wasn’t deep. 
MAT.13.6	But when the sun came up, they were scorched; and because they had no roots, they withered away. 
MAT.13.7	Other seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew and choked them out. 
MAT.13.8	But others fell on good soil and were producing fruit. They yielded a crop—some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
MAT.13.9	He who has ears, let him hear.” 
MAT.13.10	Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Why do You speak to them in parables?” 
MAT.13.11	And He replied to them, “To you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. 
MAT.13.12	For whoever has, to him more will be given and he will have plenty. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 
MAT.13.13	For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand. 
MAT.13.14	”And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, ‘You will keep on hearing but will never understand; you will keep looking, but will never see. 
MAT.13.15	For the heart of this people has become dull, their ears can barely hear, and they have shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts. Then they would turn back, and I would heal them.’ 
MAT.13.16	“But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. 
MAT.13.17	Amen, I tell you, many a prophet and 
MAT.13.18	“You then, hear the parable of the sower. 
MAT.13.19	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one having been sown along the road. 
MAT.13.20	“The one sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. 
MAT.13.21	Yet he has no root himself but lasts only a short while; and when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away. 
MAT.13.22	“But the one sown among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word; and the worries of the world and the seduction of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 
MAT.13.23	“Now the one sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands. He indeed bears fruit, yielding a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.” 
MAT.13.24	He presented to them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 
MAT.13.25	But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. 
MAT.13.26	Now when the stalk sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared. 
MAT.13.27	So the slaves of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Master, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?’ 
MAT.13.28	But he replied, ‘An enemy did this.’ Now the slaves say to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and gather them up?’ 
MAT.13.29	But he says, ‘No, for while you are gathering up the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 
MAT.13.30	Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time, I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.’” 
MAT.13.31	He presented to them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. 
MAT.13.32	It’s the smallest of all seeds; yet when it’s full grown, it’s greater than the other herbs. It becomes like a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.” 
MAT.13.33	He told them another parable, “The kingdom of heaven is like 
MAT.13.34	All these things 
MAT.13.35	in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, saying, “I will open My mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.” 
MAT.13.36	Then He sent the crowds away and went into the house. His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” 
MAT.13.37	He answered, “The one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man, 
MAT.13.38	and the field is the world. And the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one. 
MAT.13.39	The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. 
MAT.13.40	Therefore just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age. 
MAT.13.41	The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness. 
MAT.13.42	They will throw them into the fiery furnace; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.13.43	Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear! 
MAT.13.44	“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid. And because of his joy, he goes out and sells all that he has and buys that field. 
MAT.13.45	“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. 
MAT.13.46	Upon finding a pearl of great value, he went out and sold all that he had and bought it. 
MAT.13.47	“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea, gathering things of every kind. 
MAT.13.48	When it was filled, they pulled it ashore; and they sat down and gathered up the good into containers, but threw the bad away. 
MAT.13.49	So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous 
MAT.13.50	and throw them into the fiery furnace; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.13.51	“Have you understood all these things?” They said to Him, “Yes.” 
MAT.13.52	Then He said to them, “Therefore every 
MAT.13.53	Now when 
MAT.13.54	Coming into His hometown, He began to teach them in their synagogue so that they were amazed. “Where did this fellow get this wisdom and these mighty works?” they said. 
MAT.13.55	“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother called Miriam, and His brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Judah? 
MAT.13.56	And His sisters, aren’t they all with us? So where does He get all these things?” 
MAT.13.57	And they took offense at Him. But 
MAT.13.58	And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about 
MAT.14.2	He said to his servants, “This is John the Immerser—he has risen from the dead! Because of this, these powers are at work in Him.” 
MAT.14.3	For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, 
MAT.14.4	because John had been telling him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.” 
MAT.14.5	Although Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd because they considered John a prophet. 
MAT.14.6	But when Herod’s birthday celebration came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, 
MAT.14.7	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. 
MAT.14.8	Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Immerser, here on a platter!” 
MAT.14.9	The king became sorrowful; but because of his oaths and those reclining with him, he commanded it to be given. 
MAT.14.10	And he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	John’s disciples came forth and took the body and buried it. Then they went and reported to 
MAT.14.13	Now when 
MAT.14.14	As 
MAT.14.15	When it became evening, the disciples came to Him, saying, “This place is isolated, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” 
MAT.14.16	But 
MAT.14.17	“We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish,” they said to Him. 
MAT.14.18	“Bring them here to Me,” He said. 
MAT.14.19	Ordering the crowd to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, He offered the 
MAT.14.20	They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces left over. 
MAT.14.21	Now those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	Right away, 
MAT.14.23	After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the hillside by Himself to pray. And when evening came, He was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	But the boat was already a long way from land, tossed around by the waves, for the wind was against it. 
MAT.14.25	Now in the fourth watch of the night, 
MAT.14.26	But when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It’s a ghost!” And they cried out with fear. 
MAT.14.27	But immediately, 
MAT.14.28	Answering, Peter said to Him, “Master, if it’s You, command me to come to You on the water.” 
MAT.14.29	And He said, “Come!” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to go to 
MAT.14.30	But seeing the wind, he became terrified. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Master, save me!” 
MAT.14.31	Immediately 
MAT.14.32	When they got into the boat, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	And those in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “You really are 
MAT.14.34	After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place recognized 
MAT.14.36	and kept begging Him that they might just touch the 
MAT.15.1	Then some Pharisees and 
MAT.15.2	“Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not do the ritual handwashing when they eat bread.” 
MAT.15.3	And answering, He said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? 
MAT.15.4	For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.’ 
MAT.15.5	But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever you might have gained from me is a gift to God,” 
MAT.15.6	he need not honor his father.’ On account of your tradition, you made void the word of God. 
MAT.15.7	Hypocrites! Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying, 
MAT.15.8	‘This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. 
MAT.15.9	And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’” 
MAT.15.10	Then 
MAT.15.11	It’s not what goes into the mouth that makes the man unholy; but what comes out of the mouth, this makes the man unholy.” 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard this saying?” 
MAT.15.13	But He replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. 
MAT.15.14	Leave them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” 
MAT.15.15	Then Peter answered and said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.” 
MAT.15.16	“Are you also still lacking understanding?” 
MAT.15.17	“Don’t you grasp that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is ejected into the sewer? 
MAT.15.18	But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and those things make the man unholy. 
MAT.15.19	For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, and slander. 
MAT.15.20	These are the things that make the man unholy; but to eat with unwashed hands does not make the man unholy.” 
MAT.15.21	Now 
MAT.15.22	And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, O Master, 
MAT.15.23	But He did not answer her a word. And when His disciples came, they were urging Him, saying, “Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.” 
MAT.15.24	But He responded, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” 
MAT.15.25	So she came and got down on her knees before Him, saying, “Master, help me!” 
MAT.15.26	And answering, He said, “It’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 
MAT.15.27	But she said, “Yes, Master, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” 
MAT.15.28	Then answering, 
MAT.15.29	After 
MAT.15.30	And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, blind, disabled, mute, and many others. And they laid them at His feet, and He healed them. 
MAT.15.31	So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the disabled made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	 called His disciples and said, “I have compassion for the crowd, because they’ve stayed with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, because they might pass out on the way.” 
MAT.15.33	The disciples said to Him, “Where in this wasteland is enough bread to satisfy such a large crowd?” 
MAT.15.34	 said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” “Seven,” they said, “and a few small fish.” 
MAT.15.35	After directing the crowd to recline on the ground, 
MAT.15.36	He took the seven loaves and the fish; and after giving thanks, He broke them. And He began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds. 
MAT.15.37	And they all ate and were satisfied. And they picked up the broken pieces left over—seven baskets full. 
MAT.15.38	And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 
MAT.15.39	And after sending away the crowds, 
MAT.16.1	Now the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing 
MAT.16.2	But He replied to them, “When evening comes, you say, ‘Fair weather coming, for the sky is red,’ 
MAT.16.3	and in the morning, ‘Stormy weather today, for the sky is red and gloomy.’ You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times! 
MAT.16.4	An evil and adulterous generation clamors for a sign, yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And leaving them behind, He went away. 
MAT.16.5	Now when the disciples came to the other side of the sea, they had forgotten to take bread. 
MAT.16.6	“Watch out,” 
MAT.16.7	And they began to discuss among themselves, saying, “We didn’t bring any bread.” 
MAT.16.8	But knowing this, 
MAT.16.9	You still don’t get it? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets of leftovers you gathered? 
MAT.16.10	Or how about the seven loaves for the four thousand and all the baskets of leftovers you gathered? 
MAT.16.11	How is it that you don’t understand that I wasn’t talking to you about bread? Now beware of the 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that He wasn’t talking about the 
MAT.16.13	When 
MAT.16.14	They answered, “Some say John the Immerser, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets.” 
MAT.16.15	He said, “But who do you say I am?” 
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” 
MAT.16.17	 said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven! 
MAT.16.18	And I also tell you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My community; and the gates of 
MAT.16.19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will have been forbidden in heaven and what you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven.” 
MAT.16.20	Then He ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Messiah. 
MAT.16.21	From that time on, 
MAT.16.22	Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “Never, Master! This must never happen to You!” 
MAT.16.23	But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of men.” 
MAT.16.24	Then 
MAT.16.25	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 
MAT.16.26	For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? 
MAT.16.27	For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then ‘He will repay everyone according to his deeds.’ 
MAT.16.28	Amen, I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”
MAT.17.1	After six days, 
MAT.17.2	Now He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with 
MAT.17.4	Peter responded to 
MAT.17.5	While He was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice from out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased. Listen to Him!” 
MAT.17.6	When the disciples heard this, they fell face down, terrified. 
MAT.17.7	But 
MAT.17.8	And lifting their eyes, they saw no one except 
MAT.17.9	As they were coming down from the mountain, 
MAT.17.10	The disciples questioned Him, saying, “Why then do the 
MAT.17.11	 replied, “Indeed, Elijah is coming and will restore all things. 
MAT.17.12	I tell you that Elijah already came; and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.” 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Immerser. 
MAT.17.14	When they came to the crowd, a man came to 
MAT.17.15	“Master, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and suffers badly. For he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 
MAT.17.16	I brought him to Your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.” 
MAT.17.17	And answering, 
MAT.17.18	 rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed from that very hour. 
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples came to 
MAT.17.20	And He said to them, “Because you trust so little. Amen, I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
MAT.17.21	[footnote: Most manuscripts omit verse 21: 
MAT.17.22	Now while they were gathering in the Galilee, 
MAT.17.23	and they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised.” And the disciples became greatly distressed. 
MAT.17.24	When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax came to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the Temple tax, doesn’t He?” 
MAT.17.25	“Yes,” Peter said. Now when Peter came into the house, 
MAT.17.26	After Peter said, “From strangers,” 
MAT.17.27	But so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and throw out a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you’ll find a coin. Take that, and give it to them, for Me and you.”
MAT.18.1	At that hour the disciples came to 
MAT.18.2	And He called a child to Himself, set him in the midst of them, 
MAT.18.3	and said, “Amen, I tell you, unless you turn and become like children, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.4	Whoever then shall humble himself like this child, this one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.5	And whoever welcomes one such child in My name, welcomes Me. 
MAT.18.6	“But whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea! 
MAT.18.7	Woe to the world because of snares! For snares must come, but woe to that man through whom the snare comes! 
MAT.18.8	“And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It’s better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into fiery Gehenna. 
MAT.18.9	If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It’s better for you to enter into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into fiery Gehenna. 
MAT.18.10	“See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father in heaven. 
MAT.18.11	[footnote: Some manuscripts add verse 11: 
MAT.18.12	“What do you think? If a certain man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, won’t he leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go looking for the one that is straying? 
MAT.18.13	And if he finds it, 
MAT.18.14	Even so, it’s not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.” 
MAT.18.15	“Now if your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault while you’re with him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. 
MAT.18.16	But if he does not listen, take with you one or two more, so that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand.’ 
MAT.18.17	But if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to Messiah’s community. And if he refuses to listen even to Messiah’s community, let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector. 
MAT.18.18	“Amen, I tell you, whatever you forbid on earth will have been forbidden in heaven and what you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven. 
MAT.18.19	Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father in heaven. 
MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.” 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to Him and said, “Master, how often shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” 
MAT.18.22	 said to him, “No, not up to seven times, I tell you, but seventy times seven! 
MAT.18.23	Therefore, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. 
MAT.18.24	When he had begun to settle up, a man was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. 
MAT.18.25	But since he didn’t have the money to repay, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. 
MAT.18.26	Then the slave fell on his knees and begged him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I’ll repay you everything.’ 
MAT.18.27	And the master of that slave, filled with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. 
MAT.18.28	“Now that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii. And he grabbed him and started choking him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe!’ 
MAT.18.29	“So his fellow slave fell down and kept begging him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I’ll pay you back.’ 
MAT.18.30	Yet he was unwilling. Instead, he went off and threw the man into prison until he paid back all he owed. 
MAT.18.31	“So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply distressed. They went to their master and reported in detail all that had happened. 
MAT.18.32	Then summoning the first slave, his master said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave all that debt because you pleaded with me. 
MAT.18.33	Wasn’t it necessary for you also to show mercy to your fellow slave, just as I showed mercy to you?’ 
MAT.18.34	Enraged, the master handed him over to the torturers until he paid back all he owed. 
MAT.18.35	“So also My heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you, from your hearts, forgives his brother.”
MAT.19.1	Now when 
MAT.19.2	Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there. 
MAT.19.3	Pharisees came up to 
MAT.19.4	“Haven’t you read?” He answered. “He who created them from the beginning ‘made them male and female’ 
MAT.19.5	and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ 
MAT.19.6	So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no man separate.” 
MAT.19.7	They said to Him, “Why then did Moses command to ‘give her a certificate of divorce and put her away?’” 
MAT.19.8	 said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. 
MAT.19.9	Now I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.” 
MAT.19.10	The disciples said to Him, “If that’s the case for a man and his wife, it’s better not to marry!” 
MAT.19.11	But He said to them, “Not everyone can accept this saying—only those to whom it has been given. 
MAT.19.12	For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made that way by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who can accept this, let him accept it.”
MAT.19.13	Then little children were brought to 
MAT.19.14	But 
MAT.19.15	After laying His hands upon them, He went on from there. 
MAT.19.16	Now behold, one came to Him and said, “Teacher, what good shall I do to have eternal life?” 
MAT.19.17	“Why do you ask Me about what is good?” 
MAT.19.18	“Which ones?” he said. 
MAT.19.19	honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’” 
MAT.19.20	“All these I’ve kept,” the young man said to Him. “What do I still lack?” 
MAT.19.21	 said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you own, and give to the poor; and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.” 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving, for he had much property. 
MAT.19.23	Then 
MAT.19.24	Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
MAT.19.25	When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and said, “Then who can be saved?” 
MAT.19.26	And looking, 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter said to Him, “Look, we’ve left everything to follow You! So what will we have?” 
MAT.19.28	And 
MAT.19.29	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for My name’s sake, will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life. 
MAT.19.30	But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
MAT.20.1	“For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 
MAT.20.2	Now when he had agreed with the workers for a denarius per day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
MAT.20.3	And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the marketplace, idle. 
MAT.20.4	And to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I’ll give you whatever is right.’ 
MAT.20.5	So they went. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did the same. 
MAT.20.6	And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing around. And he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle the whole day?’ 
MAT.20.7	“‘Because no one hired us,’ they said to him. “He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard, too.’ 
MAT.20.8	“Now when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’ 
MAT.20.9	And those who had come about the eleventh hour each received a denarius. 
MAT.20.10	And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; yet they too received a denarius. 
MAT.20.11	“But when they received it, they began to grumble against the master of the house, 
MAT.20.12	saying, ‘These last guys did one hour, and you’ve made them equal to us, who bore the burden and scorching heat of the day!’ 
MAT.20.13	“But answering, he said to one of them, ‘Friend, I’m doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me on a denarius? 
MAT.20.14	Take what is yours and go. But I want to give this last guy the same as you. 
MAT.20.15	Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’ 
MAT.20.16	“So the last will be first, and the first last.”
MAT.20.17	Now as 
MAT.20.18	“Look, we’re going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling 
MAT.20.19	and hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify. Yet on the third day, He will be raised up.”
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came with her sons to 
MAT.20.21	“What do you want?” He said to her. She said to Him, “Declare that these two sons of mine might sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.” 
MAT.20.22	But 
MAT.20.23	He said to them, “You shall indeed drink My cup. But to sit on My right and left, this isn’t Mine to grant. Rather, it’s for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.” 
MAT.20.24	Now when the ten heard, they became indignant with the two brothers. 
MAT.20.25	But 
MAT.20.26	It shall not be this way among you. But whoever wants to be great among you shall be your servant, 
MAT.20.27	and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave—
MAT.20.28	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”
MAT.20.29	Now as they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 
MAT.20.30	And here two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that 
MAT.20.31	The crowd warned them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Master, 
MAT.20.32	 stopped and called out to them. “What do you want Me to do for you?” He said. 
MAT.20.33	They said to Him, “Master, let our eyes be opened!” 
MAT.20.34	Moved with compassion, 
MAT.21.1	Now as they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then 
MAT.21.2	saying to them, “Go into the village before you. Right away, you’ll find a donkey tied up and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to Me. 
MAT.21.3	If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Master needs them.’ And right away he will send them.” 
MAT.21.4	This happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, saying, 
MAT.21.5	“Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘See, your King is coming to you, humble and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.’” 
MAT.21.6	The disciples went and did as 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and colt and put their clothing on them, and He sat on the clothing. 
MAT.21.8	Most of the crowd spread their clothing on the road, and others began cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	The crowds going before Him and those following kept shouting, saying, “
MAT.21.10	When He entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?” 
MAT.21.11	And the crowds kept saying, “This is the prophet 
MAT.21.12	Then 
MAT.21.13	And He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of thieves’!” 
MAT.21.14	The blind and lame came to Him in the Temple, and He healed them. 
MAT.21.15	But when the ruling 
MAT.21.16	And they said to Him, “Do You hear what these children are saying?” “Yes,” 
MAT.21.17	Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and He spent the night there.
MAT.21.18	Now early in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry. 
MAT.21.19	Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came up to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again!” And the fig tree shriveled up at once. 
MAT.21.20	When the disciples saw it they were astonished. “How did the fig tree shrivel on the spot?” they asked. 
MAT.21.21	 answered them, “Amen, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. 
MAT.21.22	And whatever you ask in prayer, trusting, you shall receive.”
MAT.21.23	Now when He entered the Temple, the ruling 
MAT.21.24	 replied to them, “I also will ask you one question. If you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MAT.21.25	John’s immersion, where was it from? From heaven or from men?” They began to dialogue among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd, for all hold up John as a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	So answering 
MAT.21.28	“Now what do you think? A man had two sons, and he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’ 
MAT.21.29	The son answered, ‘I won’t,’ but afterward he had a change of heart and went. 
MAT.21.30	The man went to the second son and said the same thing. But he answered, ‘I will, sir,’ and didn’t go. 
MAT.21.31	Which of the two did the will of the father?” “The first,” they said. 
MAT.21.32	For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and even after you saw this, you had no change of heart to believe him.” 
MAT.21.33	“Listen to another parable. There was a master of a household who planted a vineyard. He put a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then He leased it to some tenant farmers and went on a journey. 
MAT.21.34	Now when fruit season drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. 
MAT.21.35	But grabbing his servants, the tenants beat up one, killed another, and stoned still another. 
MAT.21.36	Again the master sent other servants, even more than the first, and they did the same thing to them. 
MAT.21.37	Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 
MAT.21.38	“But when the tenants saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir! Come on, let’s kill him and get his inheritance!’ 
MAT.21.39	So grabbing him, they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 
MAT.21.40	Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” 
MAT.21.41	“He will bring those miserable men to a miserable end,” they said to Him, “and will lease the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the fruits in their seasons.” 
MAT.21.42	 said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures? ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone. This came from 
MAT.21.43	Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people producing its fruits. 
MAT.21.44	Whoever falls on this stone will be shattered; but the one upon whom it falls, it will crush him.” 
MAT.21.45	When the ruling 
MAT.21.46	Although they were trying to seize Him, they feared the crowds, because they regarded Him as a prophet. 
MAT.22.1	 answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying, 
MAT.22.2	“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who made a wedding feast for his son. 
MAT.22.3	He sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they wouldn’t come. 
MAT.22.4	Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who were invited, “Look, I’ve prepared my meal. My oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast!”’ 
MAT.22.5	“But paying no attention, they went away, one to his own farm, another to his business. 
MAT.22.6	And the rest grabbed his servants, humiliated them, and killed them. 
MAT.22.7	Now the king became furious! Sending his troops, he destroyed those murderers and set fire to their city. 
MAT.22.8	“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. 
MAT.22.9	So go into the highways and byways, and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.’ 
MAT.22.10	And those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was filled with guests. 
MAT.22.11	“But when the king came in to look over the guests, he saw a man there who wasn’t dressed in wedding clothes. 
MAT.22.12	‘Friend,’ he said to him, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was silent. 
MAT.22.13	Then the king said to his servants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 
MAT.22.14	For many are called, but few are chosen.” 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap Him with a word. 
MAT.22.16	And they sent to Him some of their disciples, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are honest and teach the way of God in truth. And what others think doesn’t concern You, for You do not look at men’s appearance. 
MAT.22.17	Tell us therefore, what do You think? Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
MAT.22.18	But 
MAT.22.19	Show Me the tax money.” So they brought Him a denarius. 
MAT.22.20	And He said to them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” 
MAT.22.21	“Caesar’s,” they said to Him. Then He said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” 
MAT.22.22	And hearing this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away.
MAT.22.23	On that day, Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to 
MAT.22.24	“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If someone dies having no children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his widow and father children for his brother.’ 
MAT.22.25	Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died; and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	In the same way also the second, and the third, down to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	Last of all, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	So in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.” 
MAT.22.29	But answering, 
MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 
MAT.22.31	But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read what was spoken to you by God, saying, 
MAT.22.32	‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!” 
MAT.22.33	When the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching.
MAT.22.34	But the Pharisees, when they heard that 
MAT.22.35	And testing Him, one of them, a lawyer, asked, 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the 
MAT.22.37	And He said to him, “‘You shall love 
MAT.22.38	This is the first and greatest commandment. 
MAT.22.39	And the second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 
MAT.22.40	The entire 
MAT.22.41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, 
MAT.22.42	saying, “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose Son is He?” “David’s,” they say to Him. 
MAT.22.43	“Then how is it,” He says to them, “that David by the 
MAT.22.44	For he says, ‘
MAT.22.45	If David then calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his son?” 
MAT.22.46	No one was able to answer Him a word. Nor did anyone dare from that day on to question Him any longer.
MAT.23.1	Then 
MAT.23.2	saying, “The 
MAT.23.3	So whatever they tell you, do and observe. But don’t do what they do; for what they say, they do not do. 
MAT.23.4	They tie up heavy loads, hard to carry, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves aren’t willing to lift a finger to move them. 
MAT.23.5	All their works they do to be noticed by men. They make their 
MAT.23.6	They love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, 
MAT.23.7	greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called 
MAT.23.8	“But you are not to be called rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. 
MAT.23.9	And call no man on earth your father; for One is your Father, who is in heaven. 
MAT.23.10	Nor are you to be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Messiah. 
MAT.23.11	But the greatest among you shall be your servant. 
MAT.23.12	Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. 
MAT.23.13	“But woe to you, 
MAT.23.15	“Woe to you, 
MAT.23.16	“Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘Whoever swears by the Temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple, he is obligated.’ 
MAT.23.17	O fools and blind ones! Which is greater, the gold or the Temple that made the gold holy? 
MAT.23.18	And you say, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.’ 
MAT.23.19	O blind ones! Which is greater, the offering or the altar that makes the offering holy? 
MAT.23.20	Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and everything on it. 
MAT.23.21	And whoever swears by the Temple, swears both by the Temple and by Him who dwells in it. 
MAT.23.22	And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it. 
MAT.23.23	“Woe to you, 
MAT.23.24	O blind guides, straining out a gnat while swallowing a camel! 
MAT.23.25	“Woe to you, 
MAT.23.26	O blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside may become clean as well. 
MAT.23.27	“Woe to you, 
MAT.23.28	In the same way, you appear righteous to men on the outside, but are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 
MAT.23.29	“Woe to you, 
MAT.23.30	And you say, ‘If we’d been alive in the days of our forefathers, we wouldn’t have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ 
MAT.23.31	So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 
MAT.23.32	Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers! 
MAT.23.33	O snakes, you brood of vipers! How will you escape the condemnation of Gehenna? 
MAT.23.34	“Because of this, behold, I’m sending you prophets and wise men and 
MAT.23.35	And so, upon you shall come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar. 
MAT.23.36	Amen, I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.” 
MAT.23.37	“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! 
MAT.23.38	Look, your house is left to you desolate! 
MAT.23.39	For I tell you, you will never see Me again until you say, ‘ 
MAT.24.1	Now when 
MAT.24.2	“Don’t you see all these?” He responded to them. “Amen, I tell you, not one stone will be left here on top of another—every one will be torn down!”
MAT.24.3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?” 
MAT.24.4	 answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray! 
MAT.24.5	For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will lead many astray. 
MAT.24.6	You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must happen but it is not yet the end. 
MAT.24.7	For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 
MAT.24.8	But all these things are only the beginning of birth pains. 
MAT.24.9	“Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you. You will be hated by all the nations because of My name. 
MAT.24.10	And then many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one other. 
MAT.24.11	Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 
MAT.24.12	Because lawlessness will multiply, the love of many will grow cold. 
MAT.24.13	But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 
MAT.24.14	This Good News of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. 
MAT.24.15	“So when you see ‘the abomination of desolation,’ which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the Holy Place (let the reader understand), 
MAT.24.16	then those in Judea must flee to the mountains. 
MAT.24.17	The one on the roof must not go down to take what is in his house, 
MAT.24.18	and the one in the field must not turn back to get his coat. 
MAT.24.19	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 
MAT.24.20	Pray that your escape will not happen in winter, or on Shabbat. 
MAT.24.21	For then there will be great trouble, such as has not happened since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will. 
MAT.24.22	And unless those days were cut short, no one would be delivered. But for the sake of the chosen, those days will be cut short. 
MAT.24.23	“Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here’s the Messiah,’ or ‘There He is,’ do not believe it. 
MAT.24.24	For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen. 
MAT.24.25	See, I have told you beforehand. 
MAT.24.26	“So if they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. Or, ‘Look, He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 
MAT.24.27	For just as lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so also will be the coming of the Son of Man. 
MAT.24.28	For wherever the carcass is, there the vultures will gather. 
MAT.24.29	“But immediately after the trouble of those days, ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’ 
MAT.24.30	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see ‘the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven’ with power and great glory. 
MAT.24.31	He will send out His angels with a great 
MAT.24.32	“Now learn the parable from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. 
MAT.24.33	So also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the door. 
MAT.24.34	Amen, I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. 
MAT.24.35	Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 
MAT.24.36	But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven nor the Son, except the Father alone. 
MAT.24.37	“For just as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 
MAT.24.38	For in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark. 
MAT.24.39	And they did not understand until the flood came and swept them all away. So shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man. 
MAT.24.40	Then two men will be in the field, one taken and one left. 
MAT.24.41	Two women will be grinding at the mill, one taken and one left. 
MAT.24.42	Therefore stay alert; for you do not know what day your Lord is coming. 
MAT.24.43	But know this, that if the master of the house had known what time the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and not let his house be broken into. 
MAT.24.44	So you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”
MAT.24.45	“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master put in charge of his household to give them food at the proper time? 
MAT.24.46	Blessed is that servant whose master finds him so doing when he comes. 
MAT.24.47	Amen, I tell you, his master will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
MAT.24.48	But if that wicked servant says in his heart, ‘My master is taking a long time,’ 
MAT.24.49	and he begins to beat his fellow servants, and he eats and drinks with drunkards, 
MAT.24.50	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know. 
MAT.24.51	And he will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
MAT.25.1	“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 
MAT.25.2	Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 
MAT.25.3	For when the foolish ones took their lamps, they took no oil with them. 
MAT.25.4	But the wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	“Now while the bridegroom was taking a long time, they all got drowsy and started falling asleep. 
MAT.25.6	But in the middle of the night there was a shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ 
MAT.25.7	Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps. 
MAT.25.8	Now the foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, since our lamps are going out.’ 
MAT.25.9	But the wise ones replied, ‘No, there won’t be enough for us and for you. Instead, go to those who sell, and buy some for yourselves.’ 
MAT.25.10	“But while they were going off to buy, the bridegroom came. And those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. 
MAT.25.11	Now later, the other virgins came, saying, ‘Sir, Sir, open up for us!’ 
MAT.25.12	“But he replied, ‘Amen, I tell you, I do not know you.’ 
MAT.25.13	Therefore stay alert, for you know neither the day nor the hour.”
MAT.25.14	“For it is like a man about to go on a journey. He called his own servants and handed over his possessions to them. 
MAT.25.15	To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. 
MAT.25.16	“Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more. 
MAT.25.17	In the same way, the one with two gained two more. 
MAT.25.18	But the one who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. 
MAT.25.19	“Now after a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 
MAT.25.20	The one who had received the five talents came up and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed me five talents. Look, I’ve gained five more.’ 
MAT.25.21	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a little, so I’ll put you in charge of much. Enter into your master’s joy!’ 
MAT.25.22	“The one who had received the two talents also came up and said, ‘Master, you handed me two talents. Look, I’ve gained two more.’ 
MAT.25.23	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a little, so I’ll put you in charge of much. Enter into your master’s joy!’ 
MAT.25.24	“Then the one who had received the one talent also came up and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you didn’t sow and gathering where you scattered no seed. 
MAT.25.25	So I was afraid, and I went off and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’ 
MAT.25.26	“But his master responded, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow and gather where I scattered no seed? 
MAT.25.27	Then you should have brought my money to the brokers, and when I came I would have received it back with interest. 
MAT.25.28	Therefore take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents. 
MAT.25.29	For to the one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. 
MAT.25.30	Throw the worthless servant out, into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”
MAT.25.31	“Now when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. 
MAT.25.32	All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
MAT.25.33	And He will put the sheep on His right, but the goats on His left. 
MAT.25.34	Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 
MAT.25.35	For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger and you invited Me in; 
MAT.25.36	I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’ 
MAT.25.37	“Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You? Or thirsty and give You something to drink? 
MAT.25.38	And when did we see You a stranger and invite You in? Or naked and clothe You? 
MAT.25.39	When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ 
MAT.25.40	“And answering, the King will say to them, ‘Amen, I tell you, whatever you did to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ 
MAT.25.41	Then He will also say to those on the left, ‘Go away from Me, you cursed ones, into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels. 
MAT.25.42	For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink; 
MAT.25.43	I was a stranger and you did not invite Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’ 
MAT.25.44	“Then they too will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not care for You?’ 
MAT.25.45	Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Amen, I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’ 
MAT.25.46	These shall go off to everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.”
MAT.26.1	Now it happened that when 
MAT.26.2	“You know that Passover comes in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be executed.” 
MAT.26.3	Then the ruling 
MAT.26.4	They plotted together in order that they might seize 
MAT.26.5	“But not during the festival,” they were saying, “so there won’t be a riot among the people.”
MAT.26.6	Now while 
MAT.26.7	a woman came up to Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive oil. And she poured it on His head as He was reclining at the table. 
MAT.26.8	But when the disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? 
MAT.26.9	It could have been sold for a lot, and the money given to the poor!” 
MAT.26.10	But 
MAT.26.11	You always have the poor with you, but you won’t always have Me. 
MAT.26.12	For when she poured this oil on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial. 
MAT.26.13	Amen, I tell you, wherever this Good News is proclaimed in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”
MAT.26.14	Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judah of Kriot, went to the ruling 
MAT.26.15	and said, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they weighed out thirty shekels of silver for him. 
MAT.26.16	From then on, Judah began looking for a chance to hand Him over. 
MAT.26.17	Now on the first day of 
MAT.26.18	He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near; at your house I am to keep the Passover with My disciples.”’” 
MAT.26.19	The disciples did as 
MAT.26.20	Now when it was evening, 
MAT.26.21	As they were eating, He said, “Amen, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.” 
MAT.26.22	And being very sorrowful, they began, each one, to say to Him, “I’m not the one, am I, Master?” 
MAT.26.23	And He replied, “The one who dipped his hand in the bowl with Me, he’s the one who will betray Me. 
MAT.26.24	The Son of Man indeed goes, just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!” 
MAT.26.25	And Judah, the one betraying Him, replied, “I’m not the one, am I, Rabbi?” 
MAT.26.26	Now while they were eating, 
MAT.26.27	And He took a cup; and after giving thanks, He gave to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; 
MAT.26.28	for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins. 
MAT.26.29	But I say to you, I will never drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.” 
MAT.26.30	After singing the 
MAT.26.31	Then 
MAT.26.32	But after I am raised up, I will go before you to the Galilee.” 
MAT.26.33	But Peter replied to Him, “Though all fall away because of You, I’ll never fall away.” 
MAT.26.34	 said to him, “Truly, I tell you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” 
MAT.26.35	“Even if I must die with You,” Peter says to Him, “I’ll never deny You!” And so said all the disciples. 
MAT.26.36	Then 
MAT.26.37	And He took along Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, and He began to be sorrowful and troubled. 
MAT.26.38	Then He tells them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.” 
MAT.26.39	Going a little farther, He fell face down and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me! Yet not as I will, but as You will.” 
MAT.26.40	Then He comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping; and He tells Peter, “So couldn’t you keep watch with Me for one hour? 
MAT.26.41	Keep watching and praying, so that you won’t enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 
MAT.26.42	Again for a second time He went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, let Your will be done.” 
MAT.26.43	And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	So He left them again and prayed a third time, saying the same words once more. 
MAT.26.45	Then He comes to the disciples and says to them, “Still sleeping? Taking your rest? Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners. 
MAT.26.46	Get up, let’s go! Look, My betrayer is near.”
MAT.26.47	While 
MAT.26.48	Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ‘The One I kiss, He’s the One—seize Him!’ 
MAT.26.49	And immediately Judah drew near to 
MAT.26.50	“Friend,” 
MAT.26.51	And suddenly, one of those with 
MAT.26.52	Then 
MAT.26.53	Or do you suppose that I cannot call on My Father, and at once He will place at My side twelve legions of angels? 
MAT.26.54	How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?” 
MAT.26.55	At that hour 
MAT.26.56	But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples fled, abandoning Him. 
MAT.26.57	Now those who had seized 
MAT.26.58	Peter was following Him from a distance as far as the courtyard of the 
MAT.26.59	Now the ruling 
MAT.26.60	But they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward 
MAT.26.61	and said, “This fellow said, ‘I’m able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days!’” 
MAT.26.62	The 
MAT.26.63	But 
MAT.26.64	“As you have said,” replied 
MAT.26.65	Then the 
MAT.26.66	What’s your verdict?” “Guilty,” they answered. “He deserves death!” 
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in His face and pounded Him with their fists. Others slapped Him and demanded, 
MAT.26.68	“Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Which one hit You?”
MAT.26.69	Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came over to him and said, “You also were with 
MAT.26.70	But he denied it before everyone, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!” 
MAT.26.71	When he went onto the porch, another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with 
MAT.26.72	Again he denied it with an oath: “I don’t know the Man!” 
MAT.26.73	A little while later, some of the bystanders approached Peter and said to him, “Surely you’re one of them, too—your accent gives you away.” 
MAT.26.74	Then he began to curse and to swear an oath: “I do not know the Man!” Right then, a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	Then Peter reminded himself of the word 
MAT.27.1	When daybreak came, the ruling 
MAT.27.2	And they tied Him up, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate, the governor. 
MAT.27.3	Then Judah, His betrayer, saw that 
MAT.27.4	saying, “I’ve sinned, betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What’s that to us? You see to it yourself!” 
MAT.27.5	After tossing the silver into the Temple sanctuary, he left. Then he went off and hanged himself. 
MAT.27.6	But the ruling 
MAT.27.7	So after they conferred, they bought with them the potter’s field, as a cemetery for strangers. 
MAT.27.8	For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day. 
MAT.27.9	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price of Him on whom a price had been set by 
MAT.27.10	and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as 
MAT.27.11	Now 
MAT.27.12	And while He was accused by the ruling 
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said to Him, “Don’t You hear how many things they testify against you?” 
MAT.27.14	 did not answer, not even one word, so the governor was greatly amazed. 
MAT.27.15	Now during the feast, the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner, anyone they wanted. 
MAT.27.16	At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called 
MAT.27.17	So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Which one do you want me to release for you? 
MAT.27.18	For he knew that they had handed Him over out of envy. 
MAT.27.19	While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, “Don’t have anything to do with that righteous Man, for today I’ve suffered many things in a dream because of Him.” 
MAT.27.20	Now the ruling 
MAT.27.21	But the governor responded, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “
MAT.27.22	Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with 
MAT.27.23	But Pilate said, “Why? What evil has He done?” But they kept shouting all the more, saying, “Let Him be executed!” 
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw he was accomplishing nothing, but instead a riot was starting, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this blood,” he said. “You see to it yourselves!” 
MAT.27.25	All the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!” 
MAT.27.26	Then he released to them 
MAT.27.27	Then the governor’s soldiers took 
MAT.27.28	They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him. 
MAT.27.29	And after braiding a crown of thorns, they placed it on His head and put a staff in His right hand. And falling on their knees before Him, they mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	They spat on Him, and they took the staff and beat Him over and over on the head. 
MAT.27.31	When they finished mocking Him, they stripped the robe off Him and put His own clothes back on Him. And they led Him away to crucify Him. 
MAT.27.32	As they came out, they found a man from Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced him into service, to carry 
MAT.27.33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha (that is to say, Place of a Skull), 
MAT.27.34	they offered Him wine mixed with gall to drink; but after tasting, He was unwilling to drink it. 
MAT.27.35	And when they had crucified Him, they divided His clothing among themselves by casting lots. 
MAT.27.36	And they sat down and kept guard over Him there. 
MAT.27.37	Over His head they put the charge against Him, which read: “THIS IS YESHUA, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
MAT.27.38	Then two outlaws were executed with Him, one on the right and one on the left. 
MAT.27.39	Those passing by were jeering at Him, shaking their heads 
MAT.27.40	and saying, “You who are going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If you are 
MAT.27.41	Likewise the ruling 
MAT.27.42	“He saved others,” they were saying, “but He can’t save Himself? He’s the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the stake, and we’ll believe in Him! 
MAT.27.43	He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now, if He wants Him. For He said, ‘I am 
MAT.27.44	Even the outlaws who were executed with Him were ridiculing Him in the same way.
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour, darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour. 
MAT.27.46	About the ninth hour 
MAT.27.47	When some of those standing there heard it, they began saying, “This Man is calling for Elijah.” 
MAT.27.48	Right away one of them ran and took a sponge. He filled it with sour wine and put it on a stick, and was offering it to 
MAT.27.49	But the rest were saying, “Leave Him alone! Let’s see if Elijah comes to save Him.” 
MAT.27.50	And 
MAT.27.51	And behold, the curtain of the Temple was split in two, from top to bottom. And the earth quaked and rocks were split apart. 
MAT.27.52	And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the 
MAT.27.53	And coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 
MAT.27.54	Now the centurion, and those with him keeping guard over 
MAT.27.55	Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed 
MAT.27.56	Among them were Miriam from Magdala, Miriam the mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. 
MAT.27.57	Now when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had also become a disciple of 
MAT.27.58	This man went to Pilate and asked for 
MAT.27.59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. 
MAT.27.60	And he laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone up to the door of the tomb and went away. 
MAT.27.61	Now Miriam from Magdala was there, and the other Miriam, sitting opposite the tomb.
MAT.27.62	Now on the next day, which is after the preparation, the ruling 
MAT.27.63	“Sir,” they said, “we remember how that deceiver said while He was still alive, ‘After three days I’m to be raised.’ 
MAT.27.64	Therefore, order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, so His disciples do not come and steal Him away. They will tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first!” 
MAT.27.65	“You have a guard,” Pilate said to them. “Go, make it as secure as you know how.” 
MAT.27.66	So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone along with the soldiers of the guard.
MAT.28.1	Now after Shabbat, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Miriam of Magdala and the other Miriam came to look at the tomb. 
MAT.28.2	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of 
MAT.28.3	His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	And those keeping watch were shaken for fear of him and became like dead men. 
MAT.28.5	But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know you are looking for 
MAT.28.6	He is not here; for He is risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying. 
MAT.28.7	Go quickly now and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead. And behold, He’s going before you to the Galilee. There you will see Him. See, I have told you!” 
MAT.28.8	They quickly left the tomb, with fear yet with great joy, and ran to bring news to His disciples. 
MAT.28.9	And behold, 
MAT.28.10	“Don’t be afraid,” 
MAT.28.11	Now while they were going, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the ruling 
MAT.28.12	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of silver to the soldiers, 
MAT.28.13	saying, “Tell them, ‘His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.’ 
MAT.28.14	And if this is heard by the governor, we’ll appease him and keep you out of trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story was spread among the Judeans to this day.
MAT.28.16	Now the eleven disciples went to the Galilee, to the mountain 
MAT.28.17	When they saw Him, they worshiped; but some wavered. 
MAT.28.18	And 
MAT.28.19	Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, immersing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the 
MAT.28.20	teaching them to observe all I have commanded you. And remember! I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the Good News of 
MRK.1.2	As Isaiah the prophet has written, “Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way. 
MRK.1.3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of 
MRK.1.4	John appeared, immersing in the wilderness, proclaiming an immersion involving repentance for the removal of sins. 
MRK.1.5	All the Judean countryside was going out to him, and all the Jerusalemites. As they confessed their sins, they were being immersed by him in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.6	John wore clothes made from camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 
MRK.1.7	“After me comes One who is mightier than I am,” he proclaimed. “I’m not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of His sandals! 
MRK.1.8	I immersed you with water, but He will immerse you in the 
MRK.1.9	In those days, 
MRK.1.10	Just as He was coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens ripping open and the 
MRK.1.11	And there came a voice from the heavens: “You are My Son, whom I love; with You I am well pleased!” 
MRK.1.12	That instant, the 
MRK.1.13	He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by satan. And He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were taking care of Him. 
MRK.1.14	Now after John was put in jail, 
MRK.1.15	“Now is the fullness of time,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near! Turn away from your sins, and believe in the Good News!” 
MRK.1.16	Passing along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Simon’s brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen. 
MRK.1.17	And 
MRK.1.18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 
MRK.1.19	Going a little farther, He saw Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. 
MRK.1.20	Immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired hands and followed Him. 
MRK.1.21	And they went into Capernaum. Right away, on Shabbat, He entered the synagogue and began to teach. 
MRK.1.22	And they were astounded at His teaching, for He was teaching them as one having authority and not as the 
MRK.1.23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, 
MRK.1.24	“What have we to do with You, 
MRK.1.25	 rebuked him, saying, “Quiet! Come out of him!” 
MRK.1.26	And the unclean spirit, after throwing the man into convulsions and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	They were all so amazed that they asked among themselves, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” 
MRK.1.28	And immediately news about Him spread throughout the region surrounding Galilee.
MRK.1.29	As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon and Andrew. 
MRK.1.30	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever. Right away, they told 
MRK.1.31	He came and raised her up by taking her hand. The fever left her, and she began to take care of them. 
MRK.1.32	When evening came, at sunset, the people brought to Him all the sick and those who were afflicted by demons. 
MRK.1.33	The whole town gathered together at the door. 
MRK.1.34	He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. And He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was. 
MRK.1.35	Very early, while it was still night, 
MRK.1.36	Then Simon and those with him hunted for 
MRK.1.37	And when they found Him, they said to Him, “Everybody’s looking for You.” 
MRK.1.38	He said to them, “Let’s go somewhere else, to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also—this is what I came for.” 
MRK.1.39	And He went throughout all the Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and driving out demons. 
MRK.1.40	A man with 
MRK.1.41	Moved with compassion, 
MRK.1.42	Immediately, the 
MRK.1.43	 sent him away at once, sternly warning him. 
MRK.1.44	He said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go show yourself to the 
MRK.1.45	But he went out and began to proclaim and spread the word, so much that 
MRK.2.1	When He returned to Capernaum after some days, it was heard that He was at the house. 
MRK.2.2	So many were gathered that there was no longer room for them even outside the door. He kept proclaiming the word to them. 
MRK.2.3	Some people came bringing to Him a paralyzed man, carried by four men. 
MRK.2.4	When they couldn’t get near 
MRK.2.5	, seeing their faith, said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” 
MRK.2.6	But some of the 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this fellow speak like this? He blasphemes! Who can pardon sins but God alone?” 
MRK.2.8	Immediately 
MRK.2.9	Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, and take your mat and walk’? 
MRK.2.10	But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority to pardon sins on earth….” He tells the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.11	“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home!” 
MRK.2.12	At once the man got up, took his mat, and walked before them all. They were all astonished and glorified God, saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this!”
MRK.2.13	Again, 
MRK.2.14	As He was passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. He said to him, “Follow Me.” And he got up and followed Him. 
MRK.2.15	Now it happens that 
MRK.2.16	When the 
MRK.2.17	And when He heard this, 
MRK.2.18	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came and said to Him, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?” 
MRK.2.19	And 
MRK.2.20	But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. 
MRK.2.21	“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise the patch pulls away from the old, and a worse tear happens. 
MRK.2.22	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins; and the wine is lost, also the skins. But one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.”
MRK.2.23	Now it happened on 
MRK.2.24	The Pharisees were saying to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is not permitted on Shabbat?” 
MRK.2.25	And He said to them, “Haven’t you ever read what David did when he was in need, and he and those with him became hungry? 
MRK.2.26	How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was 
MRK.2.27	Then He said to them, “
MRK.2.28	So the Son of Man is Lord even of Shabbat.”
MRK.3.1	 entered the synagogue again, and a man with a withered hand was there. 
MRK.3.2	Now some were carefully watching Him, to see if He would heal him on Shabbat, so that they might accuse Him. 
MRK.3.3	He said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up here in the center.” 
MRK.3.4	Then He said to them, “Is it permitted on 
MRK.3.5	After looking around at them with anger, grieved by their hardness of heart, He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 
MRK.3.6	The Pharisees went out right away with the Herodians and began plotting against Him, how they might destroy Him. 
MRK.3.7	 withdrew to the sea with His disciples, and a large crowd from the Galilee followed. From Judea, 
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing all He was doing, came to Him. 
MRK.3.9	He told His disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t mob Him. 
MRK.3.10	For He had healed many, so that all those afflicted fell down before Him in order to touch Him. 
MRK.3.11	And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, would fall down before Him and cry out, “You are 
MRK.3.12	But 
MRK.3.13	Now He climbs up on the mountain and calls those He Himself wanted, and they came to Him. 
MRK.3.14	He appointed twelve (whom He also named emissaries), so that they might be with Him and He might send them to proclaim the Good News, 
MRK.3.15	and to have power to drive out demons. 
MRK.3.16	And He appointed the Twelve: to Simon He gave the name Peter; 
MRK.3.17	to Jacob and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, He gave the name Boanerges, which is Sons of Thunder; 
MRK.3.18	and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot; 
MRK.3.19	and Judah from Kriot, who also betrayed Him. 
MRK.3.20	Then He comes into a house, and again a crowd gathers so they couldn’t even eat. 
MRK.3.21	When His family heard about this, they went out to take hold of Him; for they were saying, “He’s out of His mind!” 
MRK.3.22	The 
MRK.3.23	He called them and began speaking to them in parables: “How can satan drive out satan? 
MRK.3.24	If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
MRK.3.25	And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 
MRK.3.26	And if satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but his end has come. 
MRK.3.27	“But no one can enter a strong man’s house to ransack his property, unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he will thoroughly plunder his house. 
MRK.3.28	Amen, I tell you, all things will be forgiven the sons of men, the sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; 
MRK.3.29	but whoever slanders the 
MRK.3.30	For they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” 
MRK.3.31	Then His mother and brothers come. Standing outside, they sent word to Him, summoning Him. 
MRK.3.32	A crowd was sitting around Him, and they tell Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.” 
MRK.3.33	Answering them, He said, “Who are My mother and My brothers?” 
MRK.3.34	Looking at those sitting in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers! 
MRK.3.35	For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.”
MRK.4.1	Again 
MRK.4.2	He began teaching them many things by parables, and in His teaching, He said to them: 
MRK.4.3	“Listen! Behold, a sower went out to spread some seed. 
MRK.4.4	It happened that as he sowed, some fell beside the road; and the birds came and ate it up. 
MRK.4.5	“Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it didn’t have much soil. It sprang up immediately, because the soil wasn’t deep. 
MRK.4.6	But when the sun came up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
MRK.4.7	“Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew and choked it, and it yielded no crop. 
MRK.4.8	“And others fell into the good soil and were producing fruit, springing up and increasing. They yielded a crop, producing thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.” 
MRK.4.9	And He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” 
MRK.4.10	When 
MRK.4.11	And He told them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God. But for those who are outside, everything is in parables, so that 
MRK.4.12	‘Seeing, they may see and not perceive, and hearing, they may hear and not understand, so they may not turn back and be forgiven.’” 
MRK.4.13	He said to them, “Don’t you grasp this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables? 
MRK.4.14	The sower sows the word. 
MRK.4.15	These are the ones beside the road where the word is sown. Whenever they hear, satan comes quickly and takes away the word that has been sown in them. 
MRK.4.16	“These are the ones sown on rocky ground. When they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy. 
MRK.4.17	And they have no root in themselves but last only a short while. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away. 
MRK.4.18	“And others are the ones sown among the thorns. They have heard the word; 
MRK.4.19	but the worries of the world, the seduction of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 
MRK.4.20	“And those are the ones sown on the good soil. They hear the word and accept it and produce fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.” 
MRK.4.21	He also was saying to them, “Is a lamp put under a basket or a bed? No, shouldn’t it be placed on a lampstand? 
MRK.4.22	For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor anything kept secret except that it would come to light. 
MRK.4.23	If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” 
MRK.4.24	Then He continued, “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be added to you. 
MRK.4.25	For whoever has, to him more will be given. And whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”
MRK.4.26	And He was saying, “The kingdom of God is like when a man spreads seed on the soil 
MRK.4.27	and falls asleep at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows. He himself doesn’t know how. 
MRK.4.28	Automatically, the earth brings forth a crop—first the blade, then the head, then the full grain in the head. 
MRK.4.29	But when the grain is ready, at once he sends in the sickle, for the harvest has come.” 
MRK.4.30	 also said, “How should we picture the kingdom of God? Or by what story shall we present it? 
MRK.4.31	It is like a mustard seed when it’s planted in the ground. Though the smallest of all seeds in the earth, yet when planted it grows up and becomes the largest of all the herbs. 
MRK.4.32	It puts forth big branches, so the birds of the air can nest in its shade.” 
MRK.4.33	With many such parables He used to tell them the word, as much as they were able to hear. 
MRK.4.34	But apart from a parable, He wasn’t speaking to them. Yet when they were alone, to His own disciples He would explain everything.
MRK.4.35	Now on that same day in the evening, He says to them, “Let’s cross over to the other side.” 
MRK.4.36	After leaving the crowd, they take Him along in the boat, just as He was. And other boats were with Him. 
MRK.4.37	A great windstorm arises, and the waves were rushing into the boat. The boat was beginning to fill up. 
MRK.4.38	But 
MRK.4.39	So He woke up and rebuked the wind. And He said to the sea, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind stopped, and it became totally calm. 
MRK.4.40	And He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Even now you have no faith?” 
MRK.4.41	They were struck with awe and said to one another, “Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!”
MRK.5.1	They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. 
MRK.5.2	As soon as 
MRK.5.3	He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him anymore, even with a chain. 
MRK.5.4	For he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but the chains had been ripped apart by him and the shackles broken. No one was strong enough to tame him. 
MRK.5.5	And through it all, night and day, at the graveyard and in the mountains, he kept screaming and gashing himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	When he saw 
MRK.5.7	Crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What’s between You and me, 
MRK.5.8	For 
MRK.5.9	Then 
MRK.5.10	He kept begging Him not to send them out of the country. 
MRK.5.11	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside nearby. 
MRK.5.12	The unclean spirits urged Him, saying, “Send us to the pigs, so we may enter them.” 
MRK.5.13	So 
MRK.5.14	The herdsmen ran away and told the town and countryside, and they came to see what had happened. 
MRK.5.15	Now they came to 
MRK.5.16	Those who had seen it described in detail what had happened to the man plagued by a demon, and they also told about the pigs. 
MRK.5.17	And they began to beg 
MRK.5.18	As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been infested with demons kept begging to remain with Him. 
MRK.5.19	 did not let him, but He told him, “Go home to your friends and tell them how much 
MRK.5.20	So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much 
MRK.5.21	When 
MRK.5.22	Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, comes. Seeing Him, he falls at His feet. 
MRK.5.23	He begs Him a great deal, saying, “My little daughter is near death! Come and lay hands on her so that she may be healed and live!” 
MRK.5.24	So 
MRK.5.25	And there was a woman with a blood flow for twelve years, 
MRK.5.26	who had suffered much under many doctors. She had spent all that she had without benefit; instead, she grew worse. 
MRK.5.27	When she heard about 
MRK.5.28	For she kept saying, “If I touch even His clothes, I shall be healed.” 
MRK.5.29	Right away the blood flow stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease. 
MRK.5.30	At once 
MRK.5.31	His disciples responded, “You see the crowd pressing upon You and you say, ‘Who touched Me?’” 
MRK.5.32	But He kept looking around to see who had done this. 
MRK.5.33	But the woman, scared and shaking, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in 
MRK.5.35	While 
MRK.5.36	But ignoring what they said, 
MRK.5.37	He did not let anyone follow Him except Peter, Jacob, and John, the brother of Jacob. 
MRK.5.38	They come to the house of the synagogue leader. He sees a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. 
MRK.5.39	After entering, He said to them, “Why make such a fuss and weep? The child didn’t die, but is sleeping.” 
MRK.5.40	They start jeering at Him. But after sending all of them out, He takes the child’s father and mother, and those with Him, and enters where the child was. 
MRK.5.41	Then, taking hold of the child’s hand, He tells her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up.” 
MRK.5.42	Immediately, the girl stood up and began to walk around! (She was twelve years old.) And they were overcome with astonishment. 
MRK.5.43	But He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said something to eat should be given to her.
MRK.6.1	Now 
MRK.6.2	When 
MRK.6.3	Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Miriam, and the brother of Jacob and Joseph and Judah and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him. 
MRK.6.4	Then 
MRK.6.5	He was not able to do any miracle, except that He laid hands on a few sick people and healed them. 
MRK.6.6	And He was astonished because of their unbelief. And He was going around among the villages teaching. 
MRK.6.7	 summoned the Twelve, and He began to send them out two by two. And He gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 
MRK.6.8	He directed them to take nothing for the journey except a walking stick—no bread, no bag, no copper coin in their belt—
MRK.6.9	but to wear sandals and not to put on two shirts. 
MRK.6.10	He was also telling them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place. 
MRK.6.11	And whatever place will not receive you or listen to you, as you leave from there, shake the dust off the bottom of your feet as a witness against them.” 
MRK.6.12	So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent, 
MRK.6.13	and they were driving out many demons and anointing with oil many who were sick and healing them. 
MRK.6.14	King Herod heard, for 
MRK.6.15	But others were saying, “It’s Elijah!” Still others were saying, “It’s a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” 
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard, he said, “John, the one I beheaded, has been raised!” 
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her. 
MRK.6.18	For John had been telling Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	Now Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him, but she wasn’t able. 
MRK.6.20	For Herod was in awe of John and kept him safe, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When he listened to John he was confused, but he still listened gladly. 
MRK.6.21	An opportunity came—when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his high officials, military brass, and the leaders of the Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you!” 
MRK.6.23	He vowed to her, “Whatever you ask of me I’ll give you, up to half of my kingdom!” 
MRK.6.24	She left the room and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother said, “The head of John the Immerser!” 
MRK.6.25	Immediately she rushed to the king and requested, “I want you to give me, right now, the head of John the Immerser on a platter!” 
MRK.6.26	The king became very sorrowful; but because of his oaths and those reclining with him, he didn’t want to refuse her. 
MRK.6.27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring John’s head. And the executioner went out and beheaded John in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When John’s disciples heard, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. 
MRK.6.30	The twelve emissaries gathered together with 
MRK.6.31	There were many coming and going, and they had no time even to eat. So He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to an isolated place and rest awhile.” 
MRK.6.32	So they left privately by boat to an isolated place. 
MRK.6.33	However, the people saw them leaving, and many recognized them. They ran on foot from all the towns to get there ahead of them. 
MRK.6.34	As 
MRK.6.35	When it was already late, His disciples came to Him and said, “This place is isolated, and the hour is already late. 
MRK.6.36	Send these people away so they can go into the nearby countryside and the villages and buy themselves something to eat.” 
MRK.6.37	But He answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said to Him, “Should we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread to give them something to eat?” 
MRK.6.38	Then He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” 
MRK.6.39	Then 
MRK.6.40	So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties. 
MRK.6.41	And He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, He offered the 
MRK.6.42	They all ate and were satisfied, 
MRK.6.43	and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and fish. 
MRK.6.44	Now there were five thousand men who ate the loaves. 
MRK.6.45	Right away, 
MRK.6.46	After leaving them, He went up on the hillside to pray. 
MRK.6.47	And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and He was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	He saw the disciples struggling to row, for the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch in the night, 
MRK.6.49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought He was a ghost and cried out—
MRK.6.50	for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately, He spoke to them. He said, “Take courage! I am. Do not be afraid.” 
MRK.6.51	Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped. They were utterly dumbfounded, 
MRK.6.52	for they still hadn’t understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.
MRK.6.53	After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and set anchor there. 
MRK.6.54	As they got out of the boat, immediately people recognized 
MRK.6.55	They ran about the region and began to carry around on their mats all those who were in bad shape, to wherever they heard He was. 
MRK.6.56	And wherever He entered villages, towns, or countryside, people were placing the sick in the marketplaces and begging Him to let them touch even the 
MRK.7.1	Now the Pharisees and some of the 
MRK.7.2	And they saw that some of His disciples were eating bread with unclean hands, that is, not washed. 
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees and all Jewish people do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow, keeping the tradition of the elders. 
MRK.7.4	And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing. There are many other traditions they have received and hold, such as the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels.) 
MRK.7.5	The Pharisees and 
MRK.7.6	And He said to them, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors Me with their lips but their heart is far from Me. 
MRK.7.7	And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ 
MRK.7.8	Having left behind the commandment of God, you hold on to the tradition of men.” 
MRK.7.9	He was also telling them, “You set aside the commands of God, in order that you may validate your own tradition. 
MRK.7.10	For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.’ 
MRK.7.11	But you say if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever you might have gained from me is 
MRK.7.12	then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, 
MRK.7.13	making void the word of God with your tradition that you’ve handed down. And you do many such things.” 
MRK.7.14	Then 
MRK.7.15	There is nothing outside the man that can make him unholy by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of the man that makes the man unholy.” 
MRK.7.16	[footnote: Some mss. Add: 
MRK.7.17	When He had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable. 
MRK.7.18	And He said to them, “Are you then also lacking understanding? Don’t you grasp that whatever goes into the man cannot make him unholy? 
MRK.7.19	For it does not enter into the heart but into the stomach, and then goes out into the sewer, cleansing all foods.” 
MRK.7.20	And He continued, “It is what comes out of the man that makes the man unholy. 
MRK.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil intentions, sexual immorality, theft, murder, 
MRK.7.22	adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, lustfulness, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness. 
MRK.7.23	All these evil things come from within and make the man unholy.”
MRK.7.24	 got up and left from there to the region of Tyre. When He had entered a house, He didn’t want anyone to know; but He couldn’t escape notice. 
MRK.7.25	A woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him. She came immediately and fell at His feet. 
MRK.7.26	The woman was a Greek, from Syrophoenicia. And she kept begging 
MRK.7.27	He was telling her, “First let the children get their fill, for it’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 
MRK.7.28	“Yes, Master,” she said to Him, “but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 
MRK.7.29	Then He said to her, “Because of this word, go your way! The demon has left your daughter.” 
MRK.7.30	She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. 
MRK.7.31	Again He left the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis. 
MRK.7.32	They bring Him a deaf man who had a speech impediment, and they beg Him to lay His hand on him. 
MRK.7.33	 took him aside from the crowd to a private place, and He put His fingers in the man’s ears. After spitting, He touched the man’s tongue. 
MRK.7.34	Looking up to heaven, He says to the man, “Ephphatha,” which means “Be opened!” 
MRK.7.35	Immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak plainly. 
MRK.7.36	 ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more He ordered them, the more they continued proclaiming it. 
MRK.7.37	People were completely astounded, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”
MRK.8.1	In those days, there was another large crowd with nothing to eat, and 
MRK.8.2	“I have compassion for the crowd, because they’ve stayed with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat. 
MRK.8.3	If I send them home hungry they’ll pass out on the way, for some of them have come from very far away.” 
MRK.8.4	His disciples answered Him, “How can anyone satisfy these people with bread here in a wasteland?” 
MRK.8.5	“How many loaves do you have?” 
MRK.8.6	He directed the crowd to recline on the ground. After taking the seven loaves and giving thanks, He broke them and began giving them to His disciples to serve; and they served them to the crowd. 
MRK.8.7	They also had a few small fish and, after offering a 
MRK.8.8	They ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over—seven baskets. 
MRK.8.9	About four thousand were there, and 
MRK.8.10	Right away, He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the area of Dalmanutha. 
MRK.8.11	The Pharisees came and began to argue with Him, demanding a sign from heaven, to test Him. 
MRK.8.12	Sighing deeply in His spirit, 
MRK.8.13	Leaving them, He got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they had only one loaf in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	 was warning them, “Watch out! Beware of the 
MRK.8.16	They began to discuss with each other that they had no bread. 
MRK.8.17	And 
MRK.8.18	Having eyes, don’t you see? And having ears, don’t you hear? And don’t you remember? 
MRK.8.19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up?” “Twelve,” they say to Him. 
MRK.8.20	“When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up?” “Seven,” they say to Him. 
MRK.8.21	He said to them, “Do you still not understand?”
MRK.8.22	They come to Bethsaida. Some people bring a blind man to 
MRK.8.23	Taking the blind man by the hand, 
MRK.8.24	The man looked up and said, “I see men! They look like trees walking about.” 
MRK.8.25	Then 
MRK.8.26	 sent him straight home, saying, “Don’t even enter the village!” 
MRK.8.27	Now 
MRK.8.28	They told Him, “John the Immerser; and others Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.” 
MRK.8.29	Then He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered Him, “You are the Messiah!” 
MRK.8.30	And He warned them not to tell anyone about Him. 
MRK.8.31	Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and ruling 
MRK.8.32	He was speaking openly about this. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. 
MRK.8.33	But turning around and looking at His disciples, He rebuked Peter. He said, “Get behind Me, satan! You are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of men.” 
MRK.8.34	Then He called the crowd, along with His disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wants to follow after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and keep following Me. 
MRK.8.35	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the sake of the Good News will save it. 
MRK.8.36	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? 
MRK.8.37	For what could a man give in exchange for his soul? 
MRK.8.38	For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this unfaithful and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels!”
MRK.9.1	 was telling them, “Amen, I tell you, there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God come with power!”
MRK.9.2	After six days, 
MRK.9.3	His clothes became radiant and brilliantly white, whiter than any launderer on earth could bleach them. 
MRK.9.4	Then Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with 
MRK.9.5	Peter responds to 
MRK.9.6	(He didn’t know what to say, for they were terrified.) 
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud came, overshadowing them; and out of the cloud came a voice, “This is My Son, whom I love. Listen to Him!” 
MRK.9.8	Suddenly when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except 
MRK.9.9	As they were coming down from the mountain, 
MRK.9.10	They kept this word to themselves, discussing among themselves what it is to rise up from the dead. 
MRK.9.11	And they questioned Him, saying, “Why do the 
MRK.9.12	Now He told them, “Indeed Elijah comes first; he restores all things. And how is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be treated with contempt? 
MRK.9.13	I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”
MRK.9.14	When they came to the disciples, they saw a big crowd around them and the 
MRK.9.15	Suddenly, when the whole crowd saw 
MRK.9.16	He questioned them, “What are you arguing about with them?” 
MRK.9.17	And a man from the crowd answered Him, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute. 
MRK.9.18	Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes stiff. I told Your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t!” 
MRK.9.19	And answering them, He said, “Oh faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me.” 
MRK.9.20	They brought the boy to 
MRK.9.21	 asked the father, “How long has this been happening to him?” “Since he was a child,” the man answered. 
MRK.9.22	“It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion and help us!” 
MRK.9.23	“‘If You can’?” 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the boy’s father cried out, “I believe! Help my unbelief!” 
MRK.9.25	When 
MRK.9.26	After howling and shaking the boy wildly, it came out. The boy became so much like a corpse that many were saying, “He’s dead!” 
MRK.9.27	But 
MRK.9.28	After 
MRK.9.29	And He said to them, “This kind cannot come out except by prayer.” 
MRK.9.30	They left from there and passed through the Galilee. 
MRK.9.31	for He was teaching His disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, three days later He will rise up.” 
MRK.9.32	But the disciples didn’t understand this statement, and they were afraid to question Him about it.
MRK.9.33	Then they came to Capernaum. And when 
MRK.9.34	But they kept quiet, because on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. 
MRK.9.35	Sitting down, He called the Twelve and said to them, “If any man wants to be first, he shall be least of all and the servant of everyone.” 
MRK.9.36	Taking a small child, He set him in the midst of them. And taking him in His arms, He said to them, 
MRK.9.37	“Whoever welcomes one of these children in My name, welcomes Me; and whoever welcomes Me, welcomes not Me but the One who sent Me.” 
MRK.9.38	John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he wasn’t following us.” 
MRK.9.39	But 
MRK.9.40	He who is not against us is for us. 
MRK.9.41	For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name because you belong to Messiah, 
MRK.9.42	“But whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone put around his neck and to be thrown into the sea!”
MRK.9.43	“And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than, having two hands, to go to Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire. 
MRK.9.44	[footnote: Verses omitted; some mss. read: 
MRK.9.45	And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off! It’s better for you to enter life lame than, having your two feet, to be thrown into Gehenna. 
MRK.9.46	[footnote: Verses omitted; some mss. read: 
MRK.9.47	If your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into Gehenna, 
MRK.9.48	where ‘their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.’ 
MRK.9.49	“For everyone will be salted with fire. 
MRK.9.50	Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you flavor it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep 
MRK.10.1	Then getting up from there, 
MRK.10.2	Pharisees came up, and to test Him they began asking, “Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife?” 
MRK.10.3	And He replied to them, “What did Moses command you?” 
MRK.10.4	The Pharisees said, “Moses permitted a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away.” 
MRK.10.5	But 
MRK.10.6	But from the beginning of creation, God ‘made them male and female. 
MRK.10.7	For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, 
MRK.10.8	and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 
MRK.10.9	Therefore what God has joined together, let no man separate!” 
MRK.10.10	In the house, the disciples began questioning Him about this again. 
MRK.10.11	And He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 
MRK.10.12	And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she is committing adultery.”
MRK.10.13	Now people were bringing little children to 
MRK.10.14	But when 
MRK.10.15	Amen, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it!” 
MRK.10.16	And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them.
MRK.10.17	As 
MRK.10.18	“Why do you call Me good?” 
MRK.10.19	You know the commandments, ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,’ do not cheat, ‘honor your father and mother.’” 
MRK.10.20	The man responded, “Teacher, all these I have kept since my youth!” 
MRK.10.21	Looking at him, 
MRK.10.22	But at this statement, the man became sad and went away grieving, for he had much property. 
MRK.10.23	Then looking around, 
MRK.10.24	The disciples were amazed at His words. But 
MRK.10.25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
MRK.10.26	The disciples were even more astonished, saying among themselves, “Then who can be saved?” 
MRK.10.27	Looking at them, 
MRK.10.28	Peter began to say to Him, “Look, we’ve left everything to follow You!” 
MRK.10.29	“Amen, I tell you,” 
MRK.10.30	who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and property, along with persecutions; and in the 
MRK.10.31	But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
MRK.10.32	They were on the way going up to Jerusalem, and 
MRK.10.33	He said, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling 
MRK.10.34	They will mock Him and spit on Him, scourge Him and kill Him. Yet after three days, He will rise again!” 
MRK.10.35	Then Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, come up to Him, saying, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.” 
MRK.10.36	And He said to them, “What do you want Me to do for you?” 
MRK.10.37	They said to Him, “Let us sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.” 
MRK.10.38	But 
MRK.10.39	They said to Him, “We are able.” And 
MRK.10.40	But to sit on My right or left is not Mine to grant—it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 
MRK.10.41	Now when the ten heard, they started to get angry with Jacob and John. 
MRK.10.42	And calling them over, 
MRK.10.43	Yet it is not this way among you. But whoever wants to be great among you shall be your servant, 
MRK.10.44	and whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all. 
MRK.10.45	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” 
MRK.10.46	Then they came to Jericho. Now as 
MRK.10.47	When he heard that it was 
MRK.10.48	Many were warning him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, “
MRK.10.49	 stopped and said, “Call him over.” So they call the blind man, saying, “Take heart! Get up, He’s calling you!” 
MRK.10.50	Throwing off his cloak, he jumped up and came to 
MRK.10.51	And answering him, 
MRK.10.52	 said to him, “Go! Your faith has made you well.” Instantly he regained his sight and began following 
MRK.11.1	Now as they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, 
MRK.11.2	and says to them, “Go into the village ahead of you. Right away as you enter it, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it. 
MRK.11.3	If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Master needs it.’ And right away he will send it back here.” 
MRK.11.4	They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a door. And they untied it. 
MRK.11.5	Some people standing there began saying to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
MRK.11.6	They answered just as 
MRK.11.7	And they brought the colt to 
MRK.11.8	Many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread branches cut from the fields. 
MRK.11.9	Those going before and those following kept shouting, “
MRK.11.10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! 
MRK.11.11	And He entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After looking around at everything, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve, since it was already late. 
MRK.11.12	The next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry. 
MRK.11.13	Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if He would find any fruit on it. When He came up to it, He found nothing except leaves, because it wasn’t the season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	And He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” And His disciples were listening. 
MRK.11.15	Then they came to Jerusalem. And He entered the Temple and started to drive out those selling and buying in the Temple. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those selling doves, 
MRK.11.16	and He wouldn’t let anyone carry goods through the Temple. 
MRK.11.17	And He began to teach them, saying, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’” 
MRK.11.18	The ruling 
MRK.11.19	Whenever evening came, 
MRK.11.20	As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree shriveled from the roots. 
MRK.11.21	Peter remembered and said to 
MRK.11.22	And 
MRK.11.23	Amen, I tell you, if someone says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but trusts that what he says is happening, so shall it be for him. 
MRK.11.24	For this reason I say to you, whatever you pray and ask, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. 
MRK.11.25	Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your transgressions.”
MRK.11.26	[footnote: Some mss. add: 
MRK.11.27	Again they come to Jerusalem. While 
MRK.11.28	And they start saying to Him, “By what authority are You doing these things? Who gave You this authority to do these things?” 
MRK.11.29	 said to them, “I will put one question to you. Answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MRK.11.30	The immersion of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me!” 
MRK.11.31	They began to dialogue among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘From men’…?” They were afraid of the crowd, for all held that John really was a prophet. 
MRK.11.33	So answering 
MRK.12.1	 began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower. He leased it to some tenant farmers and went on a journey. 
MRK.12.2	And at the season, he sent a servant to collect from the tenants part of the vineyard’s fruit. 
MRK.12.3	But grabbing him, they beat him up and sent him away empty-handed. 
MRK.12.4	And again the man sent another servant to them, and they wounded his head and treated him shamefully. 
MRK.12.5	He sent another, and that one they killed; and so on with many others, beating some and killing some. 
MRK.12.6	He had yet one, a well-loved son. He sent him to them last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 
MRK.12.7	“But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir! Come on, let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’ 
MRK.12.8	So grabbing the son, they killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. 
MRK.12.9	“What then will the master of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. 
MRK.12.10	Haven’t you read this Scripture? ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone. 
MRK.12.11	This came from 
MRK.12.12	They were trying to seize 
MRK.12.13	Then they send some of the Pharisees and Herodians to 
MRK.12.14	They come and say to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are honest, and what others think doesn’t concern You. You don’t look at men’s appearance, but teach the way of God according to the truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 
MRK.12.15	Should we pay, or shouldn’t we?” But 
MRK.12.16	They brought one. And He said to them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” “Caesar’s,” they said to Him. 
MRK.12.17	Then 
MRK.12.18	Then Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came and began questioning 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that ‘if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother should take the widow and father children for his brother.’ 
MRK.12.20	There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and, when he died, left no offspring. 
MRK.12.21	And the second took her and died, leaving no offspring, and the third likewise. 
MRK.12.22	Now the seven left no offspring. Last of all, the woman died, too. 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection, when they rise up, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.” 
MRK.12.24	 said to them, “Isn’t this the reason you’ve gone astray, because you don’t understand the Scriptures or the power of God? 
MRK.12.25	For when they rise up from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 
MRK.12.26	But concerning the dead being raised, haven’t you read in the book of Moses about the burning bush? How God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? 
MRK.12.27	He’s not the God of the dead, but of the living. You have gone far astray!”
MRK.12.28	One of the 
MRK.12.29	 answered, “The first is, ‘
MRK.12.30	And you shall love 
MRK.12.31	The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” 
MRK.12.32	“Well said, Teacher,” the 
MRK.12.33	And ‘to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, and with all the strength,’ and ‘to love the neighbor as oneself,’ is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” 
MRK.12.34	When 
MRK.12.35	While 
MRK.12.36	David himself, through the 
MRK.12.37	If David himself calls Him ‘Lord,’ in what way is He his son?” And the large crowd was listening to Him with delight. 
MRK.12.38	In His teaching He said, “Watch out for the 
MRK.12.39	the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at feasts. 
MRK.12.40	They devour widows’ houses and make long prayers as a show. These men will receive greater condemnation!” 
MRK.12.41	He sat down opposite the treasury and began watching how the people were putting money into the offering box. Many rich people were putting in a lot. 
MRK.12.42	Then a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny. 
MRK.12.43	Calling His disciples over, He said to them, “Amen, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those contributing to the box! 
MRK.12.44	For they all put in from their surplus; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything she had, her whole living.” 
MRK.13.1	As 
MRK.13.2	 said to him, “You see these great buildings? Not one stone here will be left upon another. Every one will be torn down!” 
MRK.13.3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew were questioning Him privately, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?” 
MRK.13.5	 began to tell them, “Watch out that no one leads you astray! 
MRK.13.6	Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and they will lead many astray. 
MRK.13.7	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed, for this must happen but it is not yet the end. 
MRK.13.8	For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines. These things are only the beginning of birth pains. 
MRK.13.9	“Watch out for yourselves! They will hand you over to the courts, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of Me, as a witness to them. 
MRK.13.10	The Good News must first be proclaimed to all the nations. 
MRK.13.11	When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Say whatever is given to you in that hour, for it is not you who speaks but the 
MRK.13.12	Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. And children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. 
MRK.13.13	And you will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.”
MRK.13.14	“But when you see ‘the abomination of desolation’ standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains. 
MRK.13.15	The one on the roof must not go down, nor enter to take anything out of his house. 
MRK.13.16	And the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 
MRK.13.17	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 
MRK.13.18	Pray that it will not happen in winter. 
MRK.13.19	“For in those days there will be trouble such as has never happened, not since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will. 
MRK.13.20	And unless 
MRK.13.21	“And then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here’s the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there He is!’ do not believe it. 
MRK.13.22	For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and show signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen. 
MRK.13.23	So be careful! See, I have told you everything beforehand.”
MRK.13.24	“But in those days, after that trouble, ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, 
MRK.13.25	and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.’ 
MRK.13.26	And then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory. 
MRK.13.27	Then He will send out the angels and will gather together His chosen from the four winds, from the end of the earth, to the end of heaven.” 
MRK.13.28	“Now learn the parable from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. 
MRK.13.29	So also, when you see all these things happening, know that it is near, at the door. 
MRK.13.30	Amen, I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. 
MRK.13.31	Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 
MRK.13.32	But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven nor the Son, except the Father. 
MRK.13.33	“Keep on the lookout! Stay alert! For you do not know when the time is. 
MRK.13.34	It is like a man away on a journey. After leaving his house and putting his servants in charge and giving each his task, he also commanded the doorkeeper to watch. 
MRK.13.35	Therefore stay alert, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the early morning. 
MRK.13.36	So watch in case, coming suddenly, he finds you asleep. 
MRK.13.37	What I say to you I say to all: ‘Stay alert!’”
MRK.14.1	Now it was two days before Passover and the Feast of 
MRK.14.2	“But not during the festival,” they were saying, “so there won’t be a riot among the people.” 
MRK.14.3	And while 
MRK.14.4	But some got angry and said among themselves, “Why was this fragrant oil wasted? 
MRK.14.5	It could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor!” And they kept scolding her. 
MRK.14.6	But 
MRK.14.7	For you always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want; but you won’t always have Me. 
MRK.14.8	She did what she could—she came beforehand to anoint My body for burial. 
MRK.14.9	Amen, I tell you, wherever the Good News is proclaimed in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.” 
MRK.14.10	Then Judah from Kriot, one of the Twelve, went out to the ruling 
MRK.14.11	They were delighted when they heard this and promised to give him money. And Judah began looking for a chance to hand Him over.
MRK.14.12	Now on the first day of 
MRK.14.13	He sends two of His disciples and tells them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, 
MRK.14.14	and wherever he enters, tell the homeowner, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is My guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’ 
MRK.14.15	He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.” 
MRK.14.16	The disciples went out, came to the city, and found just what 
MRK.14.17	When it was evening, He came with the Twelve. 
MRK.14.18	As they were reclining and eating, 
MRK.14.19	They began to be sorrowful and to say to Him one by one, “I’m not the one, am I?” 
MRK.14.20	He said to them, “It’s one of the Twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl. 
MRK.14.21	For the Son of Man indeed goes, just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!” 
MRK.14.22	And while they were eating, He took 
MRK.14.23	And He took a cup; and after giving thanks, He gave to them and they all drank from it. 
MRK.14.24	And He said to them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. 
MRK.14.25	Amen, I tell you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.”
MRK.14.26	After singing the 
MRK.14.27	And 
MRK.14.28	But after I’m raised up, I will go before you to the Galilee.” 
MRK.14.29	Peter said to Him, “Even though all fall away, I won’t!” 
MRK.14.30	And 
MRK.14.31	But Peter kept insisting exceedingly, “Even if I must die with You, I’ll never deny You!” And they all were saying the same.
MRK.14.32	Then they come to a place whose name is Gethsemane; and 
MRK.14.33	He takes with Him Peter, Jacob, and John; and He began to be deeply distressed and troubled. 
MRK.14.34	And He tells them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.” 
MRK.14.35	Going a little farther, He fell to the ground and began praying that if possible this hour might pass Him by. 
MRK.14.36	And He was saying, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for You! Take this cup from Me! Yet not what I will, but what You will.” 
MRK.14.37	Then He comes and finds them sleeping; and He tells Peter, “Simon, you’re asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour? 
MRK.14.38	Keep watching and praying, so that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 
MRK.14.39	Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy. They didn’t know what to answer Him. 
MRK.14.41	And He comes the third time and says to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners. 
MRK.14.42	Get up, let’s go! Look, My betrayer is near.”
MRK.14.43	Right away, while 
MRK.14.44	Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, “The One I kiss, He’s the One! Seize Him and lead Him away under guard.” 
MRK.14.45	As soon as Judah came, he drew near to 
MRK.14.46	Then they threw their hands on 
MRK.14.47	But one of the bystanders, drawing his sword, struck the servant of the 
MRK.14.48	 said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, to capture Me as you would against a revolutionary? 
MRK.14.49	Every day I was with you in the Temple teaching, and you didn’t seize Me. But this is so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.” 
MRK.14.50	And all fled, abandoning Him. 
MRK.14.51	A certain young man was following Him, with nothing but a linen cloth around his body, and they grabbed him. 
MRK.14.52	But he ran away naked, leaving behind the linen cloth. 
MRK.14.53	Then they led 
MRK.14.54	Peter had followed Him from a distance, right into the courtyard of the 
MRK.14.55	Now the ruling 
MRK.14.56	Many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony wasn’t consistent. 
MRK.14.57	Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying, 
MRK.14.58	“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’” 
MRK.14.59	Yet even then, their testimony didn’t agree. 
MRK.14.60	The 
MRK.14.61	But keeping silent, 
MRK.14.62	“I am,” said 
MRK.14.63	Tearing his clothes, the 
MRK.14.64	You’ve heard the blasphemy. What seems right to you?” Then all condemned Him as deserving death. 
MRK.14.65	Some began to spit on Him, to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, saying, “Prophesy!” Also the guards slapped Him around. 
MRK.14.66	As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the 
MRK.14.67	Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked straight at him. “You also were with 
MRK.14.68	But he denied it, saying, “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about!” Then he went outside to the gateway, and a rooster crowed. 
MRK.14.69	Seeing him, the servant girl began again to tell the bystanders, “This is one of them.” 
MRK.14.70	But again he denied it. And a little while later, the bystanders were again saying to Peter, “Surely you’re one of them, for you’re also a Galilean.” 
MRK.14.71	But he began to curse himself and to swear an oath: “I do not know this Man you’re talking about!” 
MRK.14.72	Right then, a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter called to mind the word 
MRK.15.1	Right at daybreak, the ruling 
MRK.15.2	Pilate interrogated Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.3	The ruling 
MRK.15.4	Again, Pilate asked Him, “Aren’t you going to answer? Look how many charges they’re bringing against You!” 
MRK.15.5	But 
MRK.15.6	Now during the feast, he used to release to them one prisoner, anyone they were asking for. 
MRK.15.7	Now a man named 
MRK.15.8	The crowd came up and began to request what he was accustomed to do for them. 
MRK.15.9	But Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	For he knew that out of envy the ruling 
MRK.15.11	But the ruling 
MRK.15.12	Then answering again, Pilate said to them, “So what do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.13	They shouted back, “Execute Him!” 
MRK.15.14	Pilate responded, “Why? What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the more, “Execute Him!” 
MRK.15.15	Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released 
MRK.15.16	The soldiers took Him away, into the palace, the governor’s mansion called the Praetorium. And they call together the cohort of soldiers. 
MRK.15.17	They dress Him up in purple. After braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on Him. 
MRK.15.18	And they began to salute Him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	Over and over, they kept hitting Him on the head with a staff and spitting on Him; and kneeling down, they worshiped Him. 
MRK.15.20	When they finished mocking Him, they stripped the purple off Him and put His own clothes back on Him. And they led Him out to crucify Him. 
MRK.15.21	Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was coming in from the countryside. The soldiers force this passerby to carry 
MRK.15.22	They bring 
MRK.15.23	They were offering Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He didn’t take it. 
MRK.15.24	Then they crucify Him and divide up His clothing among themselves, casting lots for them to see who should take what. 
MRK.15.25	Now it was the third hour when they nailed Him on the stake. 
MRK.15.26	And the inscription of the charge against Him was written above: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
MRK.15.27	And with Him they execute two outlaws, one on His right and one on His left.
MRK.15.28	[footnote: Later mss. add: 
MRK.15.29	Those passing by were jeering at Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Ha! You who are going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, 
MRK.15.30	save Yourself by coming down from the stake!” 
MRK.15.31	Likewise the ruling 
MRK.15.32	Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the stake, so we may see and believe!” Even those executed with Him were ridiculing Him.
MRK.15.33	When the sixth hour had come, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
MRK.15.34	At the ninth hour 
MRK.15.35	When some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, “Look, He’s calling for Elijah.” 
MRK.15.36	Then someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine. He put it on a stick and was offering it to 
MRK.15.37	But letting out a loud cry, 
MRK.15.38	Then the curtain of the Temple was split in two, from top to bottom. 
MRK.15.39	When the centurion, who was standing in front of Him, saw the way 
MRK.15.40	There were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Miriam from Magdala, Miriam the mother of Jacob the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 
MRK.15.41	They would follow Him and serve Him when He was in the Galilee. Many other women who had gone up together with Him to Jerusalem were there also. 
MRK.15.42	Now evening had already come. Since it was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before Shabbat, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea, a respected council member who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for 
MRK.15.44	Pilate was surprised that He was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether 
MRK.15.45	When Pilate learned this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	Miriam from Magdala and Miriam the mother of Joses were watching where 
MRK.16.1	When 
MRK.16.2	Very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they come to the tomb. 
MRK.16.3	They were saying to each other, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	Looking up, they see that the stone (it was really huge) had been rolled away. 
MRK.16.5	As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were startled. 
MRK.16.6	But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going before you to the Galilee. There you will see Him, just as He told you.’” 
MRK.16.8	And going outside, they fled from the tomb, gripped by trembling and amazement. They didn’t say anything to anybody, for they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	After He had risen early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Miriam of Magdala, from whom He had driven out seven demons. 
MRK.16.10	She went and brought word to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. 
MRK.16.11	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe. 
MRK.16.12	After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking on their way to the country. 
MRK.16.13	They went and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either. 
MRK.16.14	Later He appeared to them, the eleven, as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardheartedness, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had been raised.
MRK.16.15	He told them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the Good News to every creature. 
MRK.16.16	He who believes and is immersed shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned. 
MRK.16.17	These signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak new languages; 
MRK.16.18	they will handle snakes; and if they drink anything deadly, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.” 
MRK.16.19	Then the Lord 
MRK.16.20	And they went out and proclaimed everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that follow.
LUK.1.1	Now many have undertaken to organize an account of the events fulfilled among us, 
LUK.1.2	just as they were handed down to us from the start by the eyewitnesses and reporters of the word. 
LUK.1.3	Therefore it seemed best to me also, because I have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, to write for you an orderly record, most excellent Theophilus, 
LUK.1.4	so you may know for sure the truth of the words you have been taught.
LUK.1.5	In the days of Herod, King of Judah, there was a 
LUK.1.6	Together they were righteous before 
LUK.1.7	But they were childless, because Elizabeth was barren and both of them were elderly. 
LUK.1.8	Now it happened to be Zechariah’s time to serve as 
LUK.1.9	According to the custom of the priestly office, it became his lot to enter the Holy Place of 
LUK.1.10	And the whole crowd of people was praying outside at the hour of incense burning. 
LUK.1.11	An angel of 
LUK.1.12	Zechariah was in turmoil when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him. 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give birth to your son, and you will name him John. 
LUK.1.14	And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
LUK.1.15	He will be great before 
LUK.1.16	Many of 
LUK.1.17	And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to the children and the disobedient ones to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for 
LUK.1.18	Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know this for certain? I’m an old man, and my wife is well-advanced in age.” 
LUK.1.19	And speaking to him, the angel declared, “I am Gabriel, the one standing in God’s presence. I was commissioned to tell you and proclaim to you this good news. 
LUK.1.20	So look, you will be silent and powerless to speak until the day these things happen, since you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time.” 
LUK.1.21	The people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering about his long delay in the Holy Place. 
LUK.1.22	But when he came out, he couldn’t speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Place. He was making signs to them but remained mute. 
LUK.1.23	When the days of his priestly service had been completed, he went home. 
LUK.1.24	After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and hid herself for five months, saying, 
LUK.1.25	“
LUK.1.26	Then in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by 
LUK.1.27	and to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Miriam. 
LUK.1.28	And coming to her, the angel said, “
LUK.1.29	But at the message, she was perplexed and kept wondering what kind of greeting this might be. 
LUK.1.30	The angel spoke to her, “Do not be afraid, Miriam, for you have found favor with God. 
LUK.1.31	Behold, you will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you shall call His name 
LUK.1.32	He will be great and will be called 
LUK.1.33	He shall reign over the house of Jacob for all eternity, and His kingdom will be without end.” 
LUK.1.34	Miriam said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am not intimate with a man?” 
LUK.1.35	And responding, the angel said to her, “The 
LUK.1.36	Behold, even your relative Elizabeth has conceived a son in her old age; and the one who was called barren is six months pregnant. 
LUK.1.37	For nothing will be impossible with God.” 
LUK.1.38	So Miriam said, “Behold, the servant of 
LUK.1.39	Now in those days, Miriam got up and quickly traveled into the hill country, to a town in Judah. 
LUK.1.40	She entered Zechariah’s home and happily greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Miriam’s greeting, the unborn child leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was completely filled with the 
LUK.1.42	She then cried out with a great shout, saying, “You are blessed among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. 
LUK.1.43	Who am I, that the mother of my Master should come to me? 
LUK.1.44	For even when I just heard the sound of your greeting in my ear, the unborn child leaped with joy in my womb. 
LUK.1.45	Blessed is she who trusted that there would be a fulfillment of those things spoken to her by 
LUK.1.46	Then Miriam said, “My soul magnifies 
LUK.1.47	and my spirit greatly rejoices in God, my Savior. 
LUK.1.48	For He has looked with care upon the humble state of His maidservant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed. 
LUK.1.49	For the Mighty One has done a great thing for me, and holy is His name. 
LUK.1.50	And His mercy is from generation to generation to the ones who fear Him. 
LUK.1.51	He has displayed power with His arm. He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. 
LUK.1.52	He has brought down rulers from thrones and exalted humble ones. 
LUK.1.53	He has filled the hungry with good things and sent away the rich empty-handed. 
LUK.1.54	He has helped His servant Israel, remembering His mercy, 
LUK.1.55	just as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.”
LUK.1.56	Miriam stayed with her for three months and then returned to her home. 
LUK.1.57	Upon Elizabeth’s full term to deliver, she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	Her neighbors and relatives heard how 
LUK.1.59	Now on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they kept trying to call him by his father’s name, Zechariah. 
LUK.1.60	But his mother declared, “No, he will be called John.” 
LUK.1.61	But they said to her, “No one among your relatives is called by this name.” 
LUK.1.62	So they began making signs to his father, as to what he wanted him named. 
LUK.1.63	Asking for a small tablet, he wrote, “John is his name.” They were all astonished! 
LUK.1.64	And his mouth was immediately unlocked as well as his tongue, and he began to speak, praising God. 
LUK.1.65	Fear came on all those who lived around them, and all these matters were talked about throughout the hill country of Judah. 
LUK.1.66	Everyone who heard pondered these things in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child become?” For the hand of 
LUK.1.67	His father Zechariah was filled with the 
LUK.1.68	“Blessed be 
LUK.1.69	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David, 
LUK.1.70	just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ages past, 
LUK.1.71	salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us! 
LUK.1.72	So He shows mercy to our fathers and remembers His holy covenant, 
LUK.1.73	the vow which He swore to Abraham our father, to grant us— 
LUK.1.74	rescued fearlessly from the hand of our enemies—to serve Him, 
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days. 
LUK.1.76	And you, child, will be called a prophet of Elyon. For you will go before 
LUK.1.77	to give knowledge of salvation to His people through removal of their sins. 
LUK.1.78	Through our God’s heart of mercy, the Sunrise from on high will come upon us, 
LUK.1.79	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet in the way of 
LUK.1.80	And the child kept growing and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
LUK.2.1	Now it happened in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the world’s inhabitants. 
LUK.2.2	This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
LUK.2.3	Everyone was traveling to be registered in his own city. 
LUK.2.4	Now Joseph also went up from the Galilee, out of the town of Natzeret to Judah, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was from the house and family of David. 
LUK.2.5	He went to register with Miriam, who was engaged to him and was pregnant. 
LUK.2.6	But while they were there, the time came for her to give birth— 
LUK.2.7	and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped Him in strips of cloth and set Him down in a manger, since there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	Now there were shepherds in the same region, living out in the fields and guarding their flock at night. 
LUK.2.9	Suddenly an angel of 
LUK.2.10	But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! For behold, I proclaim Good News to you, which will be great joy to all the people. 
LUK.2.11	A Savior is born to you today in the city of David, who is Messiah the Lord. 
LUK.2.12	And the sign to you is this: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.” 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly a multitude of heavenly armies appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth 
LUK.2.15	And when the angels departed from them into the heavens, the shepherds were saying to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which 
LUK.2.16	So they hurried off and found Miriam and Joseph, and the Baby lying in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	When they had seen this, they made known the word that had been spoken to them concerning this Child. 
LUK.2.18	And all those who heard were amazed at the things the shepherds told them. 
LUK.2.19	But Miriam treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart. 
LUK.2.20	The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, just as they had been told.
LUK.2.21	When eight days had passed for His 
LUK.2.22	And when the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the 
LUK.2.23	As it is written in the 
LUK.2.24	So they offered a sacrifice according to what was said in the 
LUK.2.25	Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and pious, waiting for the consolation of Israel. The 
LUK.2.26	And it had been revealed to him by the 
LUK.2.27	So in the 
LUK.2.28	Simeon received Him into his arms and offered a 
LUK.2.29	“Now may You let Your servant go in peace, O Sovereign Master, according to Your word. 
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen Your salvation, 
LUK.2.31	which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples: 
LUK.2.32	‘A light for revelation to the nations’ and the glory of Your people Israel.” 
LUK.2.33	And His father and mother were marveling at the things that were said about Him. 
LUK.2.34	And Simeon offered a 
LUK.2.35	so the thoughts of many hearts may be uncovered. (And even for you, a sword will pierce through your soul.)” 
LUK.2.36	Now Anna, a daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher, was a prophetess. She was well advanced in age, having lived with a husband only seven years 
LUK.2.37	and then as a widow until age eighty-four. She never left the Temple, serving night and day with fasting and prayers. 
LUK.2.38	And coming up at that very instant, she began praising God and speaking about the Child to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. 
LUK.2.39	When Joseph and Miriam had completed everything according to the 
LUK.2.40	The Child kept growing and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon Him. 
LUK.2.41	Now His parents were going every year to Jerusalem for the Passover feast. 
LUK.2.42	When He became twelve years old, they were going up according to festival custom. 
LUK.2.43	As they headed home after completing the days, the boy 
LUK.2.44	Supposing He was in the caravan, they went a day’s journey, then began looking for Him among relatives and friends. 
LUK.2.45	When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him. 
LUK.2.46	After three days they found Him in the Temple, sitting in the center of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	And all those hearing Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers. 
LUK.2.48	When His parents saw 
LUK.2.49	He said to them, “Why were you searching for Me? Didn’t you know that I must be about the things of My Father?” 
LUK.2.50	But they did not grasp the message He was telling them. 
LUK.2.51	Then He went down with them to Natzeret and was obedient to them. But His mother treasured all these words in her heart. 
LUK.2.52	And 
LUK.3.1	It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of the Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene. 
LUK.3.2	During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came upon John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the removal of sins. 
LUK.3.4	As it is written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of 
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled up and every mountain and hill brought low. The crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth, 
LUK.3.6	and all humanity shall see the salvation of God.’” 
LUK.3.7	Therefore John was saying to the crowds that came out to be immersed by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
LUK.3.8	Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance; and don’t even begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’! For I tell you that from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
LUK.3.9	Even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees, so every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire!” 
LUK.3.10	The crowds were asking him, “What should we do?” 
LUK.3.11	He answered them, saying, “Whoever has two coats, let him give to the one who has none; and whoever has food, let him do the same.” 
LUK.3.12	Tax collectors also came to him to be immersed. “Teacher,” they said to him, “what should we do?” 
LUK.3.13	He said to them, “Do not take more than you are supposed to.” 
LUK.3.14	Also soldiers asked him, saying, “And what should we do?” He said to them, “Do not take things from anyone by force, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be content with your wages.” 
LUK.3.15	Now the people were filled with expectation, and all were wondering in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Messiah. 
LUK.3.16	John answered them all, saying, “As for me, I immerse you with water. But One is coming who is mightier than I am; I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandals! He will immerse you in the 
LUK.3.17	His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with inextinguishable fire.” 
LUK.3.18	So with many other exhortations, John proclaimed Good News to the people. 
LUK.3.19	But Herod the tetrarch—after being rebuked by John because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the evil things Herod had done—
LUK.3.20	added even this on top of them all: he shut up John in prison. 
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were immersed, 
LUK.3.22	and the 
LUK.3.23	 was about thirty years old when He began his ministry. He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, 
LUK.3.24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
LUK.3.25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
LUK.3.26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
LUK.3.27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
LUK.3.28	the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
LUK.3.29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
LUK.3.31	the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
LUK.3.32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, 
LUK.3.33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
LUK.3.34	the son of Jacob, the son of Yitzhak, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
LUK.3.35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
LUK.3.36	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
LUK.3.37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan, 
LUK.3.38	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
LUK.4.1	, now filled with the 
LUK.4.2	for forty days, being tested by the devil. Now He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He was hungry. 
LUK.4.3	The devil said to Him, “If You are 
LUK.4.4	 answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’” 
LUK.4.5	And leading Him up, the devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant. 
LUK.4.6	And the devil said to Him, “I’ll give to You all this authority along with its glory, because it has been handed over to me and I can give it to anyone I wish. 
LUK.4.7	Therefore, if you will worship before me, all this shall be Yours.” 
LUK.4.8	But answering, 
LUK.4.9	Then he brought 
LUK.4.10	For it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you,’ 
LUK.4.11	and ‘upon their hands they will lift you up, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.’” 
LUK.4.12	But answering, 
LUK.4.13	And when the devil had completed every test, he departed from Him until another occasion.
LUK.4.14	 returned in the power of the 
LUK.4.15	He taught in their synagogues, and everyone was praising Him. 
LUK.4.16	And He came to Natzeret, where He had been raised. As was His custom, He went into the synagogue on Shabbat, and He got up to read. 
LUK.4.17	When the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him, He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, 
LUK.4.18	“The 
LUK.4.19	and to proclaim the year of 
LUK.4.20	He closed the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue were focused on Him. 
LUK.4.21	Then He began to tell them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears.” 
LUK.4.22	All were speaking well of Him and marveling at the gracious words coming out of His mouth. And they were saying, “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?” 
LUK.4.23	But He said to them, “Doubtless you will say to Me this proverb, ‘Doctor, heal yourself!’ and ‘What we have heard was done at Capernaum, do as much here also in your hometown.’” 
LUK.4.24	But He said, “Truly, I tell you, ‘No prophet is accepted in his own hometown.’ 
LUK.4.25	But with all truthfulness I say to you, that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was closed for three and a half years and there came a great famine over all the land. 
LUK.4.26	Elijah was not sent to any of them, but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon, to a widowed woman. 
LUK.4.27	There were many with 
LUK.4.28	Now all in the synagogue were filled with rage upon hearing these things. 
LUK.4.29	Rising up, they drove Him out of the town and brought Him as far as the edge of the mountain on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him off the cliff. 
LUK.4.30	But passing through the middle of them, He went on His way. 
LUK.4.31	 came down to Capernaum, a town in the Galilee. He was teaching them on Shabbat, 
LUK.4.32	and they were astounded at His teaching because His message had authority. 
LUK.4.33	In the synagogue was a man who had an unclean demonic spirit, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	“Ah! What have we to do with You, 
LUK.4.35	 rebuked him, saying, “Quiet! Come out of him!” And when the demon threw him down in their midst, it came out without hurting him. 
LUK.4.36	They were all amazed, and they spoke to one another, saying, “What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.” 
LUK.4.37	So His reputation grew, spreading to every place in that region. 
LUK.4.38	After He left the synagogue, 
LUK.4.39	Then standing over her, He rebuked the fever and it left her. Immediately she arose to wait on them. 
LUK.4.40	When the sun was setting, they brought to 
LUK.4.41	Even demons were coming out from many, shouting out and saying, “You are 
LUK.4.42	Now when it was day, He left and went to a desert place. The crowds were searching for Him, and they came to Him and were trying to keep Him from leaving them. 
LUK.4.43	But He said to them, “I must proclaim the Good News of the kingdom of God to the other towns also. It was for this purpose I was sent.” 
LUK.4.44	So He kept preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
LUK.5.1	It happened that the crowds were pressing upon 
LUK.5.2	when He saw two boats standing beside the lake. Now the fishermen had left them and were washing the nets. 
LUK.5.3	Getting into one of the boats, Simon’s boat, 
LUK.5.4	When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Go out into the deep water, and let down your nets for a catch.” 
LUK.5.5	Simon replied, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and caught nothing. But at Your word I will let down the nets.” 
LUK.5.6	When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets began to break. 
LUK.5.7	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. 
LUK.5.8	But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at 
LUK.5.9	For amazement had gripped him and all who were with him, over the catch of fish they had netted; 
LUK.5.10	so also Jacob and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were partners with Simon. But 
LUK.5.11	So when they had brought the boats to the landing, they left everything and followed Him. 
LUK.5.12	Now while 
LUK.5.13	 stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be cleansed!” Immediately, the 
LUK.5.14	 ordered him to tell no one, but commanded him, “Go and show yourself to the 
LUK.5.15	But the news about 
LUK.5.16	Yet He would often slip away into the wilderness and pray.
LUK.5.17	Now on one of those days, 
LUK.5.18	And behold, men were carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher, trying to bring him in and place him before 
LUK.5.19	But when they found no way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his stretcher through the tiles, right in the middle before 
LUK.5.20	When He saw their faith, He said, “Man, your sins are forgiven.” 
LUK.5.21	Then the 
LUK.5.22	, knowing their thoughts, replied to them, “Why are you raising questions in your hearts? 
LUK.5.23	Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 
LUK.5.24	But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins….” He said to the paralyzed one, “I tell you, get up and take your cot, and go home!” 
LUK.5.25	Immediately he got up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God. 
LUK.5.26	Astonishment took hold of them, and they glorified God and all were filled with awe, saying, “We’ve seen incredible things today!”
LUK.5.27	After these things, 
LUK.5.28	And leaving everything, he got up and followed Him. 
LUK.5.29	Levi made a great banquet for 
LUK.5.30	The Pharisees and their 
LUK.5.31	And 
LUK.5.32	I did not come to call the righteous, but the sinful to repentance.” 
LUK.5.33	But they said to Him, “John’s disciples often fast and offer prayers, as do the disciples of the Pharisees. But Your disciples are eating and drinking.” 
LUK.5.34	But 
LUK.5.35	But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.” 
LUK.5.36	Now he was also telling them a parable. “No one tears a patch from a new garment to use it on an old garment. Otherwise he will rip the new, and the patch from the new will not match the old. 
LUK.5.37	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, it will be spilled out, and the skins will be destroyed. 
LUK.5.38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 
LUK.5.39	No man who drinks old wine wants new, because he says, ‘The old is fine.’”
LUK.6.1	Now during Shabbat, 
LUK.6.2	But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on Shabbat?” 
LUK.6.3	Then answering them, 
LUK.6.4	How he entered into the house of God, took and ate the showbread which only the 
LUK.6.5	He said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat.” 
LUK.6.6	On a different Shabbat, 
LUK.6.7	But closely watching Him were the 
LUK.6.8	But He knew their opinions and said to the man with the paralyzed hand, “Get up and stand in our midst.” And getting up, the man stood. 
LUK.6.9	 said to them, “I ask you, is it permitted on 
LUK.6.10	Then looking around at everyone, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man did, and his hand was restored. 
LUK.6.11	But they were filled with fury and discussed among themselves what they might do to 
LUK.6.12	And it was during these days that 
LUK.6.13	When day came, He called His disciples, choosing from among them twelve whom He also named emissaries—
LUK.6.14	Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and Jacob and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; 
LUK.6.15	and Matthew and Thomas; Jacob the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot; 
LUK.6.16	Judah the son of Jacob; and Judah from Kriot, who became a traitor.
LUK.6.17	Then 
LUK.6.18	had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases. Even those disturbed by defiling spirits were being healed. 
LUK.6.19	Everyone in the crowd was trying to touch Him, because power flowed from Him and He was healing them all. 
LUK.6.20	And looking up at His disciples, He said, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. 
LUK.6.21	Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. 
LUK.6.22	Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man. 
LUK.6.23	Rejoice in that day and jump for joy! For behold, your reward is great in heaven! For their fathers used to treat the prophets the same way.” 
LUK.6.24	But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full. 
LUK.6.25	Woe to you who are full, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who are laughing now, for you shall mourn and weep. 
LUK.6.26	Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets the same way.” 
LUK.6.27	“But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
LUK.6.28	bless those who curse you, pray for the ones who mistreat you. 
LUK.6.29	To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also. And from the one who takes your cloak, do not hold back your shirt. 
LUK.6.30	Give to every one who asks you; and whoever takes something of yours, make no demands upon him. 
LUK.6.31	“Do to others as you would have them do to you. 
LUK.6.32	If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. 
LUK.6.33	And if you do good to those who are doing good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do this. 
LUK.6.34	And if you lend to those from whom you expect to take, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same. 
LUK.6.35	“But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great and you will be sons of Elyon, for He is kind to the ungrateful and evil ones. 
LUK.6.36	Be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate to you.” 
LUK.6.37	Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Pardon, and you will be pardoned. 
LUK.6.38	Give, and it will be given to you—a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, overflowing, will be given into your lap. For whatever measure you measure out will be measured back to you.” 
LUK.6.39	He also spoke this parable to them: “The blind cannot show the way to the blind, can he? Won’t they both fall into a pit? 
LUK.6.40	A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. 
LUK.6.41	“Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam in your own eye? 
LUK.6.42	How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly the speck in your brother’s eye, to take it out.” 
LUK.6.43	“For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again does a rotten tree produce good fruit. 
LUK.6.44	Each tree comes to be known by its own fruit. For figs are not gleaned out of briars; neither are bunches of grapes gathered from thorn bushes. 
LUK.6.45	“Out of the good treasure of his heart the good man brings forth good, and out of evil the evil man brings forth evil. For from the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks.” 
LUK.6.46	“Why do you call Me ‘Master, Master’ and do not do what I say? 
LUK.6.47	Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you what he is like. 
LUK.6.48	He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the torrent burst against that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built. 
LUK.6.49	“But the one who hears yet does not do is like a man who built a house upon land without a foundation. When the torrent burst against it, immediately it collapsed—and the destruction of that house was great!”
LUK.7.1	When 
LUK.7.2	Now a certain centurion had a valued slave, who was ill and about to die. 
LUK.7.3	When he heard about 
LUK.7.4	When they came to 
LUK.7.5	for he loves our people and even built our synagogue.” 
LUK.7.6	Now 
LUK.7.7	That is why I didn’t consider myself worthy to come to You. But say the word and let my servant be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 
LUK.7.9	Now when 
LUK.7.10	When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
LUK.7.11	The next day 
LUK.7.12	Just as He came near the town gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, a widow. A considerable crowd from the town was with her. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her and said, “Don’t cry.” 
LUK.7.14	Then He came up and touched the coffin, and the pallbearers came to a standstill. He said, “Young man! I tell you, get up!” 
LUK.7.15	The dead man sat up and began speaking, and 
LUK.7.16	Fear took hold of them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us, and God has visited His people.” 
LUK.7.17	This report concerning Him spread throughout all Judea and the surrounding region.
LUK.7.18	John’s disciples reported to him about all these things. Calling two of his disciples, 
LUK.7.19	John sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we look for another?” 
LUK.7.20	When they appeared before Him, the men said, “John the Immerser sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?’” 
LUK.7.21	At this very hour He was healing many of diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits; and He granted sight to many who were blind. 
LUK.7.22	And answering, He said to them, “Go report to John what you saw and heard: the blind see, the lame walk, those with 
LUK.7.23	Blessed is he who is not led to stumble because of Me.” 
LUK.7.24	And after John’s messengers left, He began to speak about John to the crowds. “What did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 
LUK.7.25	No? So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine garments? Look, those who wear finery and live in luxury are in the palaces of kings! 
LUK.7.26	Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, even more than a prophet. 
LUK.7.27	This is the one about whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way before You.’ 
LUK.7.28	I say to you, there is no one greater than John among those born of women; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” 
LUK.7.29	And when all the people heard, even the tax collectors, they affirmed God’s justice, because they had been immersed with John’s immersion. 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and 
LUK.7.31	“So then, to what shall I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? 
LUK.7.32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other, saying, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We sang a dirge, and you didn’t weep.’ 
LUK.7.33	“For John the Immerser has come not eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ 
LUK.7.34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking. and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 
LUK.7.35	Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” 
LUK.7.36	Now one of the Pharisees was asking 
LUK.7.37	And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she discovered that 
LUK.7.38	As she stood behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to drench His feet with tears and kept wiping them with her head of hair. Then she was kissing His feet and anointing them with perfume. 
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee who invited Him saw this, he said to himself, “If this were a prophet, He would know what sort of woman is touching Him—that she’s a sinner.” 
LUK.7.40	And answering, 
LUK.7.41	“A moneylender had two debtors. One owed him five hundred denarii, but the other fifty. 
LUK.7.42	When neither could repay him, he canceled both debts. So which of them will love him more?” 
LUK.7.43	Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.” “You have judged correctly,” 
LUK.7.44	Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you didn’t give Me water for My feet. But she has drenched My feet with tears and wiped them with her hair. 
LUK.7.45	You didn’t greet Me with a kiss; but from the time she entered, she has not stopped kissing My feet. 
LUK.7.46	You didn’t anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with perfume. 
LUK.7.47	For this reason I tell you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven—for she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little. 
LUK.7.48	He then said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.” 
LUK.7.49	But those who were reclining at table with Him began to say to one another, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?” 
LUK.7.50	Then He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in 
LUK.8.1	Soon afterward, 
LUK.8.2	And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities — Miriam, the one called Magdalene, out of whom seven demons had gone; 
LUK.8.3	Joanna, the wife of Kuza, Herod’s finance minister; Susanna; and many others—were supporting them out of their own resources. 
LUK.8.4	And when a large crowd was gathering and those from various towns were traveling to Him, He spoke by means of a parable. 
LUK.8.5	“The sower went out to spread his seed. As he sowed, some fell beside the road and was trampled; and the birds of the air ate it up. 
LUK.8.6	And other seed fell on rock; when it came up, that seed withered away because it had no moisture. 
LUK.8.7	Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. 
LUK.8.8	And other seed fell into the good soil; and when it came up, it produced fruit a hundredfold.” While saying these things, He would call out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” 
LUK.8.9	Now His disciples were asking Him what this parable meant. 
LUK.8.10	Then 
LUK.8.11	“Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. 
LUK.8.12	Those beside the road are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved. 
LUK.8.13	But those on the rocky places are the ones who, when they hear, accept the word with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a season, and in a time of testing fall away. 
LUK.8.14	Now that which fell into the thorns are those who were hearing; but as they go along the way, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear mature fruit. 
LUK.8.15	But the seed in the good soil are those with a praiseworthy and good heart, who have heard the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with patient endurance. 
LUK.8.16	“Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it with some object or places it under a bed. But he puts it on a lampstand so that all those who enter may be able to see the light. 
LUK.8.17	For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor secret that shall not be known and come into open view. 
LUK.8.18	So pay attention how you listen. For whoever has, to him more will be given. And whoever does not have, even what he supposes he has will be taken away from him.” 
LUK.8.19	’s mother and brothers came to Him, but were not able to reach Him through the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	Now it was reported to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.” 
LUK.8.21	But answering, He said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it.”
LUK.8.22	Now on one of those days 
LUK.8.23	Then as they were sailing, He fell asleep. A violent windstorm came down on the lake, and they were swamped with water and in danger. 
LUK.8.24	They came to 
LUK.8.25	Then 
LUK.8.26	They sailed over to the country of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side of the Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	A demon-plagued man from the town met 
LUK.8.28	Seeing 
LUK.8.29	For 
LUK.8.30	 questioned him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he said, for many demons had entered him. 
LUK.8.31	They kept begging Him not to command them to depart into the abyss. 
LUK.8.32	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding on the mountain. The demons urged 
LUK.8.33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs. The herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and was drowned. 
LUK.8.34	But when the herdsmen saw what happened, they ran away and reported it in the town and countryside. 
LUK.8.35	People went out to see what had happened. They came to 
LUK.8.36	Now those who had seen it reported how the demon-plagued man had been restored. 
LUK.8.37	And all the people from the region surrounding the Gerasenes asked 
LUK.8.38	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with 
LUK.8.39	“Return to your home, and describe all that God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town all that 
LUK.8.40	As 
LUK.8.41	And here came a man named Jairus, a leader in the synagogue. Falling at 
LUK.8.42	because his only daughter, about twelve years old, was dying. But as He made His way, the masses were crushing in upon Him. 
LUK.8.43	And there was a woman with a blood flow for twelve years, who could not be healed by anyone. 
LUK.8.44	She came up from behind and touched the 
LUK.8.45	 said, “Who touched Me?” When everyone denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding You and pressing in!” 
LUK.8.46	But 
LUK.8.47	Then seeing that she did not escape notice, the woman came trembling and fell prostrate before Him. In the presence of all the people, she confessed why she had touched Him and how she had been healed immediately. 
LUK.8.48	He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in 
LUK.8.49	While He was still speaking, someone comes from the house of the synagogue leader, saying, “Your daughter has died. Don’t bother the Teacher anymore.” 
LUK.8.50	But hearing this, 
LUK.8.51	When 
LUK.8.52	And everyone was weeping and lamenting her; but He said, “Don’t weep, for she didn’t die but is sleeping.” 
LUK.8.53	But they were ridiculing Him, knowing she had died. 
LUK.8.54	But 
LUK.8.55	Her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. 
LUK.8.56	Her parents were utterly astonished, but He ordered them to say nothing of what had happened.
LUK.9.1	Now when 
LUK.9.2	He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. 
LUK.9.3	And He said to them, “Take nothing for the journey—no walking stick, no travel bag, no bread, no money, nor even to have two shirts. 
LUK.9.4	Whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there. 
LUK.9.5	And whoever does not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a witness against them.” 
LUK.9.6	So they went out and began traveling throughout the villages, proclaiming the Good News and healing everywhere. 
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard all that was happening. He was very confused, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, 
LUK.9.8	but others that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet from among the ancients had arisen. 
LUK.9.9	But Herod said, “I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Him.
LUK.9.10	When the emissaries returned, they described to 
LUK.9.11	But the crowds found out and followed Him. So 
LUK.9.12	Now the day began to wind down, and the twelve came and said to 
LUK.9.13	But 
LUK.9.14	For there were about five thousand men. Then 
LUK.9.15	They did so, and all reclined. 
LUK.9.16	And He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, He offered the 
LUK.9.17	Then they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of the fragments.
LUK.9.18	Once when 
LUK.9.19	They replied, “John the Immerser, but others Elijah, and others that some prophet from among the ancients has arisen.” 
LUK.9.20	Then He said to them, “But who do you that say I am?” Then Peter answered and said, “The Messiah of God.” 
LUK.9.21	But 
LUK.9.22	saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and ruling 
LUK.9.23	Then 
LUK.9.24	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. 
LUK.9.25	“For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? 
LUK.9.26	For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels. 
LUK.9.27	But I tell you truthfully, there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”
LUK.9.28	About eight days after these teachings, 
LUK.9.29	While He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothing flashed like white lightning. 
LUK.9.30	And behold, two men were talking with Him, Moses and Elijah. 
LUK.9.31	Appearing in glory, they were speaking of 
LUK.9.32	Now Peter and those with him were overcome with sleep. But when they awakened, they saw 
LUK.9.33	And as they were leaving 
LUK.9.34	While he was yet saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
LUK.9.35	Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, the One I have chosen. Listen to Him!” 
LUK.9.36	And after the voice happened, 
LUK.9.37	On the next day as they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met 
LUK.9.38	Suddenly a man from the crowd shouted out loudly, saying, “Teacher, I’m begging You to look at my son, for he’s my only child! 
LUK.9.39	You see, a spirit takes hold of him, and he immediately screams. It throws him into convulsions with frothing. It hardly ever leaves him—it’s crushing him! 
LUK.9.40	I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t.” 
LUK.9.41	Then answering, 
LUK.9.42	And while the boy was still approaching 
LUK.9.43	And all were amazed at the mighty power of God. But as everyone was marveling at all He was doing, He said to His disciples, 
LUK.9.44	“Put these words into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” 
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this statement; it was yet concealed from them so they could not grasp it. And they were afraid to ask Him about this statement. 
LUK.9.46	Now a dispute began between the disciples as to who might be the greatest among them. 
LUK.9.47	But 
LUK.9.48	He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in My name, welcomes Me. And whoever welcomes Me, welcomes the One who sent Me. The one who is the least among all of you is the one who is great.” 
LUK.9.49	John replied, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he doesn’t follow along with us.” 
LUK.9.50	 said to him, “Do not stop him, for he who is not against you is for you.”
LUK.9.51	When the days were approaching for Him to be taken up, 
LUK.9.52	He sent messengers before Him, and they went and entered a Samaritan village to make His arrangements. 
LUK.9.53	But they did not receive Him, because He was focused on going up to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	When His disciples Jacob and John saw this, they said, “Master, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” 
LUK.9.55	But 
LUK.9.56	Then they moved on to another village. 
LUK.9.57	As they were traveling on the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.” 
LUK.9.58	But 
LUK.9.59	He said to another, “Follow Me.” But that one said, “First let me go and bury my father.” 
LUK.9.60	But 
LUK.9.61	Then another also said, “I will follow You, Master, but first let me say goodbye to those in my home.” 
LUK.9.62	But 
LUK.10.1	Now after these things, the Lord assigned seventy others and sent them out by twos before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to go. 
LUK.10.2	And He was telling them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest. 
LUK.10.3	“Go forth! Look, I am sending you as lambs in the midst of wolves. 
LUK.10.4	Do not be burdened with a money belt, travel bag, or shoes; and do not greet anyone along the way. 
LUK.10.5	Whatever home you enter, first say, “
LUK.10.6	If a son of 
LUK.10.7	And remain in this same home, eating and drinking the things they offer, for the worker is deserving of his wage. Do not keep moving from house to house. 
LUK.10.8	“Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what they set before you. 
LUK.10.9	Then heal the sick in that town, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 
LUK.10.10	But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, then go out into its streets and say, 
LUK.10.11	‘Even the dust of your town sticking to our feet, we wipe off as a witness to you. But know this! The kingdom of God has come near.’ 
LUK.10.12	I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town. 
LUK.10.13	“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have turned long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
LUK.10.14	Yet it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you! 
LUK.10.15	And you, Capernaum? You won’t be lifted up to heaven, will you? No, you will go down as far as 
LUK.10.16	The one who listens to you hears Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me, and the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”
LUK.10.17	Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, “Master, even the demons submit to us in Your name!” 
LUK.10.18	And 
LUK.10.19	Behold, I have given you authority to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 
LUK.10.20	Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names have been written in the heavens.” 
LUK.10.21	In that very hour, He was overjoyed in the 
LUK.10.22	All things have been handed over to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.” 
LUK.10.23	Then turning to the disciples, He said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! 
LUK.10.24	For I tell you, many prophets and kings desired to see what you are seeing yet did not see, and to hear what you are hearing yet did not hear.”
LUK.10.25	Now a certain 
LUK.10.26	Then 
LUK.10.27	And he replied, “You shall love 
LUK.10.28	 said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.” 
LUK.10.29	But wanting to vindicate himself, he said to 
LUK.10.30	 replied, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He was attacked by robbers, who stripped him and beat him. Then they left, abandoning him as half dead. 
LUK.10.31	And by chance, a 
LUK.10.32	Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side. 
LUK.10.33	But a Samaritan who was traveling came upon him; and when he noticed the man, he felt compassion. 
LUK.10.34	He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine. Then setting him on his own animal, he brought him to a lodge for travelers and took care of him. 
LUK.10.35	The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him. And whatever else you spend, upon my return I will repay you myself.’ 
LUK.10.36	Which of these three seems to you a neighbor to the one attacked by robbers?” 
LUK.10.37	And he said, “The one who showed mercy to him.” Then 
LUK.10.38	Now while they were traveling, 
LUK.10.39	She had a sister called Miriam, who was seated at the Master’s feet, listening to His teaching. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted with much serving; so she approached 
LUK.10.41	But answering her, the Lord said, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and bothered about many things; 
LUK.10.42	but only one thing is necessary. For Miriam has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”
LUK.11.1	Now 
LUK.11.2	Then 
LUK.11.3	Give us each day our daily bread. 
LUK.11.4	And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.” 
LUK.11.5	Then 
LUK.11.6	because a friend of mine has come to me on his journey and I have nothing to set before him.’ 
LUK.11.7	Then from within he may answer, saying, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up to give you anything.’ 
LUK.11.8	I tell you, even if the friend will not get up and give him anything out of friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs. 
LUK.11.9	“So I say to you, ‘Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. 
LUK.11.10	For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.’ 
LUK.11.11	What father, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? 
LUK.11.12	And if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion? 
LUK.11.13	If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the 
LUK.11.14	Now 
LUK.11.15	But some among them said, “By beelzebul, the ruler of demons, He drives out demons.” 
LUK.11.16	Others, testing Him, were demanding from Him a sign from heaven. 
LUK.11.17	But 
LUK.11.18	Now if satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say by beelzebul I drive out the demons. 
LUK.11.19	But if by beelzebul I drive out demons, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason, they will be your judges. 
LUK.11.20	But if by the finger of God I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you. 
LUK.11.21	“When a strong one, fully-armed, protects his own estate, his possessions are safe. 
LUK.11.22	But as soon as someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him, then he takes away the armor that he had trusted in and divides up his plunder. 
LUK.11.23	He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. 
LUK.11.24	“When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places looking for rest. Not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house where I came from.’ 
LUK.11.25	And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order. 
LUK.11.26	Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and settle there. And that man’s last condition becomes worse than the first.” 
LUK.11.27	Then as 
LUK.11.28	But He said, “Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it.” 
LUK.11.29	With the crowds increasing, 
LUK.11.30	For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. 
LUK.11.31	The Queen of the South will rise up at the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here. 
LUK.11.32	The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation. And indeed, one greater than Jonah is here. 
LUK.11.33	“No one lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on the lampstand so that those entering may see the light. 
LUK.11.34	Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light. But when it is sick, your body is full of darkness. 
LUK.11.35	Therefore, watch out that the light in you is not darkness. 
LUK.11.36	If then your body is full of light, with no part of it dark, it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its gleam.”
LUK.11.37	As He spoke, a Pharisee asked 
LUK.11.38	But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that 
LUK.11.39	But the Lord said to him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and plate, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. 
LUK.11.40	Fools! Didn’t He who created the outside also create the inside? 
LUK.11.41	But give as 
LUK.11.42	“But woe to you Pharisees, for you tithe mint, rue, and every garden herb, yet bypass justice and the love of God. It is necessary to do these things without neglecting the others. 
LUK.11.43	Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces. 
LUK.11.44	Woe to you, for you are like unmarked tombs, and people walk over them without knowing.” 
LUK.11.45	But answering, one of the 
LUK.11.46	Then 
LUK.11.47	“Woe to you, for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your own fathers killed! 
LUK.11.48	So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers, for indeed they killed them and you are building their tombs. 
LUK.11.49	“For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and emissaries, and some of them they will kill and persecute, 
LUK.11.50	so that the blood of the prophets shed since the foundation of the world might be required from this generation— 
LUK.11.51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the one who perished between the altar and the house of God. Yes, I tell you, it will be required from this generation.’ 
LUK.11.52	“Woe to you, 
LUK.11.53	When 
LUK.11.54	plotting against Him to catch Him in His words. 
LUK.12.1	Meanwhile, when thousands of people had gathered, so many that they were trampling one another, 
LUK.12.2	There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. 
LUK.12.3	Therefore, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops. 
LUK.12.4	“I say to you, My friends, you should not be afraid of those who kill the body, since after this they have nothing more they can do. 
LUK.12.5	But I will show you whom you should fear. Fear the One who, after the killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One! 
LUK.12.6	“Aren’t five sparrows being sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God. 
LUK.12.7	Indeed, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. 
LUK.12.8	Now I tell you, whoever acknowledges Me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God. 
LUK.12.9	But the one who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God. 
LUK.12.10	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who slanders the 
LUK.12.11	And when they bring you to the synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how you should defend yourself or what you should say, 
LUK.12.12	because the 
LUK.12.13	Then someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 
LUK.12.14	But 
LUK.12.15	Then He said to them, “Watch out! Be on guard against all kinds of greed, because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the material goods he possesses.” 
LUK.12.16	And 
LUK.12.17	And he began thinking to himself, saying, ‘What shall I do? I don’t have a place to store my harvest!’ 
LUK.12.18	And he said, ‘Here’s what I’ll do! I’ll tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I’ll store all my grain and my goods. 
LUK.12.19	And I’ll say to myself, ’O my soul, you have plenty of goods saved up for many years! So take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry.”’ 
LUK.12.20	But God said to him, ‘You fool! Tonight your soul is being demanded back from you! And what you have prepared, whose will that be?’ 
LUK.12.21	So it is with the one who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.” 
LUK.12.22	Then 
LUK.12.23	For life is more than food and the body more than clothing. 
LUK.12.24	Consider the ravens. They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than birds! 
LUK.12.25	“And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 
LUK.12.26	So if you cannot do even something very little, why do you worry about other things? 
LUK.12.27	Consider the lilies, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these. 
LUK.12.28	But if God so clothes the grass in the field—which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow—then how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith? 
LUK.12.29	“So do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying. 
LUK.12.30	For all the nations of the world strive after these things. But your Father knows that you need these things. 
LUK.12.31	Instead, seek His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you. 
LUK.12.32	Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father chose to give you the kingdom. 
LUK.12.33	“Sell your possessions and do 
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
LUK.12.35	“Have your belt strapped on and lamps burning. 
LUK.12.36	Be like people waiting for their master to return from a wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately. 
LUK.12.37	“Happy are those slaves whose master finds them alert when he comes. Amen, I tell you, he will prepare himself and have them recline at table, and will come and serve them. 
LUK.12.38	”And if he comes in the second or even the third watch and finds them so, they will be happy. 
LUK.12.39	But understand this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 
LUK.12.40	You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you don’t expect.” 
LUK.12.41	Then Peter said, “Master, are You telling this parable for us, or for everyone?” 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their food portion at the proper time? 
LUK.12.43	Blessed is that servant whose master finds him so doing when he comes. 
LUK.12.44	Truly I tell you, his master will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
LUK.12.45	“But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master is taking a long time to come,’ and he begins to beat the young slave boys and girls and to eat and drink and get drunk, 
LUK.12.46	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know. And he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful. 
LUK.12.47	“That slave who knew his master’s will but did not prepare or act according to his desire will be harshly whipped. 
LUK.12.48	But the one who did not know and did things worthy of a beating will be whipped lightly. From everyone given much, much will be required; and from the one for whom more is provided, all the more they will ask of him. 
LUK.12.49	“I came to pour out fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already ablaze! 
LUK.12.50	But I have an immersion to endure, and how distressed I am until it is finished! 
LUK.12.51	“Do you suppose that I have come to bring 
LUK.12.52	From now on there will be five in one house in opposition, three against two and two against three. 
LUK.12.53	They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” 
LUK.12.54	Then He also was saying to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, instantly you say, ‘A rainstorm is coming’—and so it is. 
LUK.12.55	And when a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘It will be a scorcher’—and so it is. 
LUK.12.56	Hypocrites! The surface of the earth and sky you know how to interpret yet you don’t know how to interpret this present time? 
LUK.12.57	Why can’t you judge for yourselves what is right? 
LUK.12.58	For while you are going with your accuser to the authorities, make an effort to come to a settlement with him—so he doesn’t drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer of the court, and the officer of the court throw you into prison. 
LUK.12.59	I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last little bit.”
LUK.13.1	Now there were some present at the same time who told 
LUK.13.2	He answered and said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans are worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered these things? 
LUK.13.3	No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you all will perish the same way. 
LUK.13.4	“Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and were killed, do you suppose that they are worse sinners than all the people living in Jerusalem? 
LUK.13.5	No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you all will perish the same way. 
LUK.13.6	Then 
LUK.13.7	So he said to the gardener, ‘Indeed, for three years I‘ve come searching for fruit on this fig tree and found none. Remove it! Why does it use up the ground?’ 
LUK.13.8	“But answering, the gardener said to him, ‘Master, leave it alone for this year also, until I dig around it and apply fertilizer. 
LUK.13.9	And if it bears fruit, good. But if not, cut it down.’”
LUK.13.10	Now 
LUK.13.11	And behold, there was a woman with a disabling spirit for eighteen years, bent over and completely unable to stand up straight. 
LUK.13.12	When 
LUK.13.13	Then He laid hands on her, and instantly she stood up straight and began praising God. 
LUK.13.14	But the synagogue leader, indignant that 
LUK.13.15	But the Lord answered him and said, “Hypocrites! On 
LUK.13.16	So this one, a daughter of Abraham incapacitated by satan for eighteen years, shouldn’t she be set free from this imprisonment on Yom Shabbat?” 
LUK.13.17	When 
LUK.13.18	So 
LUK.13.19	It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and dropped into his own garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.” 
LUK.13.20	Again He said, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? 
LUK.13.21	It is like 
LUK.13.22	And He continued on His journey through the towns and villages, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	And someone said to Him, “Master, are only a few being saved?” Then 
LUK.13.24	“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able. 
LUK.13.25	Once the Master of the household gets up and shuts the door, and you’re standing outside and begin knocking on the door, saying, ‘Master, open up for us,’ then He will say to you, ‘I don’t know where you come from.’ 
LUK.13.26	Then you will start to say, ‘We ate and drank in Your company, and You taught in our streets.’ 
LUK.13.27	But He will say, ‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Get away from Me, all of you evildoers!’” 
LUK.13.28	“There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. 
LUK.13.29	And they will come from the east and west and from the north and south, and they will recline at table in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.13.30	And indeed, some are last who shall be first, and some are first who shall be last.”
LUK.13.31	In that hour, some Pharisees came up and said to 
LUK.13.32	But 
LUK.13.33	But I must keep going today and tomorrow because it just can’t be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.34	“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. 
LUK.13.35	Look, your house is left to you desolate! For I tell you, you will never see Me until you say, ‘
LUK.14.1	Now when 
LUK.14.2	And there before Him was a man swollen with fluid. 
LUK.14.3	So 
LUK.14.4	But they kept silent. So 
LUK.14.5	Then He said to them, “Which of you, with a son or an ox falling into a well on Yom Shabbat, will not immediately pull him out?” 
LUK.14.6	And they could not reply to these things. 
LUK.14.7	 began telling a parable to those who had been invited, when He noticed how they were choosing the seats of honor. He said to them, 
LUK.14.8	“When you are invited by someone to a wedding, don’t take the seat of honor, for someone more highly esteemed than you may have been invited by him. 
LUK.14.9	Then the one who invited both of you will come to you and say, ‘Give up this seat.’ And with shame, you would proceed to take the lowest seat. 
LUK.14.10	But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest seat so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you shall be honored in the presence of all those who are dining with you. 
LUK.14.11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 
LUK.14.12	Then 
LUK.14.13	But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind; 
LUK.14.14	and you will be blessed, since they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.” 
LUK.14.15	Now hearing this, one of those dining with 
LUK.14.16	But 
LUK.14.17	At the time for the banquet, he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, everything is already prepared.’ 
LUK.14.18	“But every one of them began to beg off. The first said to him, ‘I bought a farm, and I’m obligated to go out to see it. I’m asking you to have me excused.’ 
LUK.14.19	Then another one said, ‘I’ve purchased five teams of oxen, and I’m going to check them out. I’m asking you to have me excused.’ 
LUK.14.20	Still another said, ‘I’ve married a wife, so I cannot come.’ 
LUK.14.21	“The slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house got angry and said to his slave, ‘Quickly go out into the squares and alleys of the city and bring here the poor, the maimed, the blind, and the lame.’ 
LUK.14.22	“And the slave said, ‘Master, I have done as you instructed, and still there is room.’ 
LUK.14.23	“So the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the thoroughfares and fenced areas, and press them to come in so my home may be filled. 
LUK.14.24	For I tell you, none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’” 
LUK.14.25	Now great crowds were traveling with 
LUK.14.26	“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters—and yes, even his own life—he cannot be My disciple. 
LUK.14.27	Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple. 
LUK.14.28	“For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and figure out the cost, to see if he has enough to finish it? 
LUK.14.29	Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and isn’t able to finish everything, all who see it begin to mock him,
LUK.14.30	saying, ‘This man began to build and wasn’t able to finish!’ 
LUK.14.31	“Or what king, going to make war against another king, won’t first sit down to consider whether he is able with ten thousand to confront the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 
LUK.14.32	If not, while the other is still far away, he sends an ambassador and asks for peace. 
LUK.14.33	So in the same way, whoever does not renounce all that he has, cannot be My disciple. 
LUK.14.34	“Therefore, salt is good; but if the salt should lose its flavor, how shall it be made salty again? 
LUK.14.35	It is not suitable for the soil or for a manure heap—it is thrown out. The one who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
LUK.15.1	Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to hear 
LUK.15.2	The Pharisees and the 
LUK.15.3	So He told this parable to them, saying, 
LUK.15.4	“Which man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it? 
LUK.15.5	When he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
LUK.15.6	And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says, ‘Rejoice with me, for I’ve found my sheep that was lost!’ 
LUK.15.7	I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one repenting sinner than over the ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.” 
LUK.15.8	“Or which woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it? 
LUK.15.9	When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I’ve found the coin I had lost!’ 
LUK.15.10	In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” 
LUK.15.11	Then 
LUK.15.12	and the younger of them said to the father, ‘Father, give me the share of the property that comes to me.’ So he divided his wealth between them. 
LUK.15.13	“Not many days later, the younger son gathered everything and traveled to a far country, and there he squandered his inheritance on wild living. 
LUK.15.14	Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine came against that country, and he began to be in need. 
LUK.15.15	So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. 
LUK.15.16	And he was longing to fill up on the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one was giving him any. 
LUK.15.17	“But when he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food overflowing, but here I am dying of hunger! 
LUK.15.18	I’ll get up and go to my father, and I’ll say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your presence. 
LUK.15.19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers. 
LUK.15.20	“And he got up and went to his own father. But while he was still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion. He ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 
LUK.15.21	Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your presence. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 
LUK.15.22	“But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him! Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. 
LUK.15.23	Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let’s celebrate with a feast! 
LUK.15.24	For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life—he was lost and is found!’ Then they began to celebrate. 
LUK.15.25	“Now his older son was out in the field. And as he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 
LUK.15.26	And he called out to one of the servants and began to ask what these things could be. 
LUK.15.27	“The servant said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got him back safe and sound.’ 
LUK.15.28	“But the older son was angry and didn’t want to go in. So his father came outside and pleaded with him. 
LUK.15.29	But he answered and said to his father, ‘Look, so many years I’ve slaved away for you—not once did I ignore your order. Yet you’ve never given me a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 
LUK.15.30	But when this son of yours came—the one who has squandered your wealth with prostitutes—for him you killed the fattened calf!” 
LUK.15.31	“Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything that is mine is yours. 
LUK.15.32	But it was right to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead but has come back to life! He was lost, but is found.’” 
LUK.16.1	Now 
LUK.16.2	So he called the manager and said to him, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’ 
LUK.16.3	“Then the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I’m not strong enough to dig; I’m ashamed to beg. 
LUK.16.4	I know what I’ll do, so that when I’m put out of management others will welcome me into their homes.’ 
LUK.16.5	So he called in each one of his master’s debtors, and he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ 
LUK.16.6	“He said, ‘One hundred units of olive oil.’ “The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’ 
LUK.16.7	Then he said to another, ‘Now how much do you owe?’ “He said, ‘A hundred units of wheat.’ “The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’ 
LUK.16.8	“Now the master praised the crooked manager because he had acted shrewdly, for the sons of this age are smarter when dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. 
LUK.16.9	I say to you, make friends for yourselves from the wealth of the world, so when it runs out, they will welcome you into the eternal shelters. 
LUK.16.10	“One who is faithful in the smallest matters is also faithful in much, and the one unjust in the smallest matters will likewise be unjust in much. 
LUK.16.11	So then, if you cannot be trusted with unjust wealth, who will trust you with true wealth? 
LUK.16.12	Now if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you anything of your own? 
LUK.16.13	No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick by one and look down on the other. You cannot serve God and money.”
LUK.16.14	Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and sneering at 
LUK.16.15	But He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves before the people, but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men is detestable in God’s sight.” 
LUK.16.16	“The 
LUK.16.17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single serif of the 
LUK.16.18	Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. And he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery. 
LUK.16.19	“Now there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, living it up in luxury every day. 
LUK.16.20	But a poor man named Lazarus had been laid at his gate, covered with sores 
LUK.16.21	and longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table. Besides, even the dogs were coming to lick his sores. 
LUK.16.22	“It happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. Then the rich man also died and was buried. 
LUK.16.23	And from 
LUK.16.24	So he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me! And send Lazarus so he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, because I am suffering torment in this flame.’ 
LUK.16.25	“But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your life you received your good things, even as Lazarus received the bad things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented. 
LUK.16.26	Besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is firmly set, so that those who want to cross over to you cannot, nor can those from there cross over to us. 
LUK.16.27	“Then the rich man said, ‘I beg you then, Father Abraham, send Lazarus to my father’s house! 
LUK.16.28	For I have five brothers to warn, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’ 
LUK.16.29	“But Abraham says, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets. Let them listen to them.’ 
LUK.16.30	“But he said, ‘No, Father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’ 
LUK.16.31	“But Abraham said, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead!’”
LUK.17.1	Then 
LUK.17.2	It would be better for him to have a millstone put around his neck and to be hurled into the sea, than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 
LUK.17.3	“Keep yourselves alert! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. 
LUK.17.4	Even if he sins against you seven times a day, and seven times returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.” 
LUK.17.5	Then the emissaries said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” 
LUK.17.6	Then the Lord said, “If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. 
LUK.17.7	But if you have a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, who among you will say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come right in, and recline at table’? 
LUK.17.8	But won’t he instead say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat! Dress yourself and wait on me while I eat and drink; and afterward, you may eat and drink’? 
LUK.17.9	He doesn’t thank the slave because he did what he was commanded, does he? 
LUK.17.10	So you too, when you’ve done everything you are commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves. We have done only what we were supposed to do.’”
LUK.17.11	Now while going up to Jerusalem, 
LUK.17.12	As He entered a certain village, ten men with 
LUK.17.13	and raised their voices, saying, “
LUK.17.14	When He saw them, He said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the 
LUK.17.15	Now one of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back, glorifying God with a loud voice. 
LUK.17.16	And he fell at 
LUK.17.17	Then 
LUK.17.18	Weren’t any found who came back to give glory to God except this foreigner?” 
LUK.17.19	Then 
LUK.17.20	Now when 
LUK.17.21	Nor will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.” 
LUK.17.22	Then 
LUK.17.23	They will say to you, ‘Look, there!’ or ‘Look, here!’ Do not go and chase after them. 
LUK.17.24	For just as the lightning flashes from one part of the sky and lights up another part, so will the Son of Man be in His day. 
LUK.17.25	But first He must suffer much and be rejected by this generation. 
LUK.17.26	As it was in the days of Noah, so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man. 
LUK.17.27	They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.28	“It was just the same in the days of Lot. They were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building. 
LUK.17.29	But on the day Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.30	Things will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is made fully known. 
LUK.17.31	In that day, the one who is on the roof, and his possessions in the house, must not go down to take them away. In the same way, the one who is in the field must not turn back. 
LUK.17.32	Remember Lot’s wife! 
LUK.17.33	Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it. 
LUK.17.34	“I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken along and the other left. 
LUK.17.35	There will be two women grinding at the same place. One will be taken and the other left.”
LUK.17.37	“Where, Lord?” they replied. And He said to them, “Where there is a corpse, there also will the vultures be gathered.”
LUK.18.1	Then 
LUK.18.2	He said, “There was a judge in a certain city who neither feared God nor respected people. 
LUK.18.3	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him, saying, ‘Give me justice against my opponent.’ 
LUK.18.4	“He was unwilling at the time. But afterward he said to himself, ‘Although I don’t fear God or respect people, 
LUK.18.5	yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice so she won’t wear me out by her incessant coming.’” 
LUK.18.6	Then the Lord said, “Hear what the unjust judge is saying. 
LUK.18.7	Won’t God do justice for His chosen ones, who cry out to Him day and night? Will He be slow to help them? 
LUK.18.8	I tell you, He will quickly give them justice. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?” 
LUK.18.9	Then 
LUK.18.10	“Two men went up to the Temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
LUK.18.11	The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: ‘O God, I thank You that I am not like other people—thieving, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 
LUK.18.12	I fast twice a week and tithe on all that I get.’ 
LUK.18.13	“But the tax collector, standing some distance away, wouldn’t even lift his eyes toward heaven, but beat his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, the sinner!’ 
LUK.18.14	I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went down to his home declared righteous. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 
LUK.18.15	Now they were bringing even their babies to 
LUK.18.16	But 
LUK.18.17	Amen, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” 
LUK.18.18	And a religious leader inquired of 
LUK.18.19	“Why are you calling Me good?” 
LUK.18.20	You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” 
LUK.18.21	The man said, “All these I have kept since my youth.” 
LUK.18.22	When 
LUK.18.23	But upon hearing these things, he became deeply distressed, for he was very rich. 
LUK.18.24	Gazing at him, 
LUK.18.25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.18.26	Then those who heard said, “Then who can be saved?” 
LUK.18.27	But 
LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, “Look, we’ve left everything of our own to follow You.” 
LUK.18.29	And 
LUK.18.30	who will not receive many times as much in this age; and in the 
LUK.18.31	Then 
LUK.18.32	He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and He will be mocked and insulted and spat upon. 
LUK.18.33	After they have scourged Him, they will kill Him. Yet on the third day, He will rise again.” 
LUK.18.34	But they understood none of these things; this message was hidden from them, and they did not understand what He was saying. 
LUK.18.35	Now as 
LUK.18.36	But when he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. 
LUK.18.37	They told him that 
LUK.18.38	And he cried out, saying, “
LUK.18.39	And those leading the way were scolding him, so he would be quiet. But he kept shouting all the more, “
LUK.18.40	So 
LUK.18.41	“What do you want Me to do for you?” And he said, “Master, I want to see again!” 
LUK.18.42	 said to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has made you well.” 
LUK.18.43	Immediately the man received his sight and began following 
LUK.19.1	Now 
LUK.19.2	And here was a man by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 
LUK.19.3	Zacchaeus was trying to see who 
LUK.19.4	So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see 
LUK.19.5	When 
LUK.19.6	Zacchaeus hurried and came down and welcomed Him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	But when everyone saw it, they began to grumble, saying, “
LUK.19.8	But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord. “Look, Master, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have somehow cheated anyone, I repay four times as much!” 
LUK.19.9	Then 
LUK.19.10	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” 
LUK.19.11	As they were listening to this, 
LUK.19.12	Therefore He said, “A certain nobleman went to a faraway land to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. 
LUK.19.13	And calling ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business until I come back.’ 
LUK.19.14	But his citizens detested him and they sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this fellow to reign over us!’ 
LUK.19.15	When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he called for those slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much business they had done. 
LUK.19.16	Now the first appeared, saying, ‘Master, your one mina has made ten.’ 
LUK.19.17	The master said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you were faithful with so little, take charge over ten cities.’ 
LUK.19.18	Also, the second slave came, saying, ‘Your mina, Master, made five.’ 
LUK.19.19	Then he also said to this one, ‘You are likewise over five cities.’ 
LUK.19.20	But another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina. I was keeping it safe in a handkerchief, 
LUK.19.21	for I was afraid of you because you are a strict man. You take what you did not make and reap what you did not sow.’ 
LUK.19.22	He said to him, ‘By the words of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked slave! You knew that I am strict, taking what I did not make and reaping what I did not sow? 
LUK.19.23	Then why didn’t you put my money in the bank, so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest?’ 
LUK.19.24	Then to the bystanders he said, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ 
LUK.19.25	But they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas!’ 
LUK.19.26	‘I tell you, to everyone who has, more shall be given. But from the one who doesn’t have, even what he does have shall be taken away. 
LUK.19.27	But those hostile to me, who didn’t want me to reign over them, bring them here and execute them before me.’”
LUK.19.28	After saying these things, 
LUK.19.29	When He got near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples, 
LUK.19.30	saying, “Go into the village ahead. As you enter, you will find a colt tied up, that no one has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it. 
LUK.19.31	And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say, ‘The Master needs it.’” 
LUK.19.32	Those who were headed out found things just as He told them. 
LUK.19.33	Then as they were untying the colt, his owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 
LUK.19.34	They said, “The Master needs it.” 
LUK.19.35	Then they brought it to 
LUK.19.36	And as He went along, the people were spreading their cloaks on the road. 
LUK.19.37	When 
LUK.19.38	saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of 
LUK.19.39	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!” 
LUK.19.40	But answering, 
LUK.19.41	As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 
LUK.19.42	saying, “If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to 
LUK.19.43	For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 
LUK.19.44	And they will smash you to the ground—you and your children within you. And they won’t leave within you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”
LUK.19.45	Then 
LUK.19.46	saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’” 
LUK.19.47	And He was teaching every day in the Temple. The ruling 
LUK.19.48	but they could not find any way to do it, because all the people were hanging on His words.
LUK.20.1	On one of the days while 
LUK.20.2	And they spoke, saying to Him, “Tell us by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is the one who gave You this authority?” 
LUK.20.3	But answering, 
LUK.20.4	the immersion of John—was it from heaven or from men?” 
LUK.20.5	They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘From men,’ then all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John is a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	So they answered that they didn’t know where it came from. 
LUK.20.8	And 
LUK.20.9	Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time. 
LUK.20.10	And at the season, he sent a servant to the tenants so that they would give him part of the vineyard’s fruit. But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed. 
LUK.20.11	So he proceeded to send another servant. They beat him too and treated him shamefully, and they sent him away empty-handed. 
LUK.20.12	And he proceeded to send a third one. They wounded this one too, and they threw him out. 
LUK.20.13	“Now the master of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love. Probably they will show him respect.’ 
LUK.20.14	But when the tenants saw him, they discussed the matter among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir! Let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours.’ 
LUK.20.15	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the master of the vineyard do to them? 
LUK.20.16	He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” But when they heard this, they said, “May it never happen!” 
LUK.20.17	Then 
LUK.20.18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered; but the one upon whom it falls, it will crush him.” 
LUK.20.19	The 
LUK.20.20	Now they watched Him and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order to trap Him in His words so they could hand Him over to the power and authority of the governor. 
LUK.20.21	And they asked Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You tell it straight and You teach it straight. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God according to the truth. 
LUK.20.22	Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
LUK.20.23	But carefully considering their treachery, 
LUK.20.24	“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they said, “Caesar’s.” 
LUK.20.25	Then He said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” 
LUK.20.26	And they could not trap Him in His words in the presence of the people. Astonished by His answer, they kept silent. 
LUK.20.27	Then some of the Sadducees (who deny there is a resurrection) came and questioned 
LUK.20.28	“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that ‘if a man’s brother dies’ having a wife ‘but no children, then his brother should take the widow and father children for his brother.’ 
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless; 
LUK.20.30	and the second 
LUK.20.31	and the third took her, but in this same way, each of the seven brothers died and left no children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally the woman died too. 
LUK.20.33	So in the resurrection, whose wife is she? For all seven had married her.” 
LUK.20.34	 said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. 
LUK.20.35	But those considered worthy to reach the 
LUK.20.36	For they can no longer die, because they are like angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 
LUK.20.37	But at the burning bush even Moses revealed that the dead are raised, when he calls 
LUK.20.38	Now He is God not of the dead but of the living, for to Him they all are living.” 
LUK.20.39	Some of the 
LUK.20.40	For they no longer dared to question Him about anything. 
LUK.20.41	Then 
LUK.20.42	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, ‘
LUK.20.43	until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’ 
LUK.20.44	David then calls Him ‘Lord’; so how is He his son?” 
LUK.20.45	Then with all the people listening, 
LUK.20.46	“Beware of the 
LUK.20.47	They devour widows’ houses and make long prayers as a show. These men will receive greater condemnation!”
LUK.21.1	Then 
LUK.21.2	He also saw a poor widow dropping in two small copper coins. 
LUK.21.3	And He said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all the rest. 
LUK.21.4	For all these put in their gifts from their surplus. But she, out of her poverty, put in all she had to live on.” 
LUK.21.5	And while some were talking about the Temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, 
LUK.21.6	“As for these things you are looking at, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another. Every one will be torn down!” 
LUK.21.7	And they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, so when will these things happen? What will be the sign that these things are about to take place?” 
LUK.21.8	And He said, “Watch out that you are not led astray! For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He’ and ‘The time is near!’ Do not follow them. 
LUK.21.9	And when you hear of wars and chaos, do not be terrorized. For these things need to happen first, but the end will not come at once.” 
LUK.21.10	Then He continued telling them, “Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
LUK.21.11	There will be great earthquakes along with famines and epidemics in various places, and there will be terrors along with great signs from heaven. 
LUK.21.12	But before all these things, they will grab you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons, and leading you away to kings and governors on account of My name. 
LUK.21.13	This will lead you to be a witness. 
LUK.21.14	So make up your minds not to prepare ahead of time to defend yourselves—
LUK.21.15	for I Myself will give you speech and wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute. 
LUK.21.16	But you will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends—and they will put some of you to death. 
LUK.21.17	And you will be hated by all because of My name. 
LUK.21.18	Yet not a hair of your head will be lost. 
LUK.21.19	By your endurance, you will gain your souls. 
LUK.21.20	“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near. 
LUK.21.21	Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those inside the city must get out, and those in the countryside must not enter her. 
LUK.21.22	For these are the days of punishment, to fulfill all that has been written. 
LUK.21.23	“Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath on this people. 
LUK.21.24	They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. 
LUK.21.25	“There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars. And upon the earth nations will be confused by the roaring of the sea and its waves. 
LUK.21.26	People will lose heart from fear and anticipation of what is overtaking the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
LUK.21.27	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
LUK.21.28	Now when these things begin to happen, stand straight and lift up your heads, because your salvation is near!” 
LUK.21.29	Then 
LUK.21.30	As soon as they sprout their leaves, you see it and you know at once that summer is near. 
LUK.21.31	So also, when you see these all these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. 
LUK.21.32	Amen, I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. 
LUK.21.33	Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 
LUK.21.34	“But watch out so your hearts are not weighed down by carousing, strong drink, and the worries of life. Do not let that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. 
LUK.21.35	For it will come rushing upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. 
LUK.21.36	But stay alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” 
LUK.21.37	So during the days 
LUK.21.38	And all the people would come early in the morning to hear Him in the Temple. 
LUK.22.1	Now the Feast of 
LUK.22.2	The ruling 
LUK.22.3	Then satan entered into Judah, the one from Kriot, one of the twelve. 
LUK.22.4	And he went away and talked with the ruling 
LUK.22.5	They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	So he agreed and began looking for a chance to hand 
LUK.22.7	Then came the day of 
LUK.22.8	Now 
LUK.22.9	Then they said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare?” 
LUK.22.10	And He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters. 
LUK.22.11	And say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’ 
LUK.22.12	And with that, he will show you a large upper room, fully furnished. Make preparations there.” 
LUK.22.13	So they left and found just what 
LUK.22.14	When the hour came, 
LUK.22.15	And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 
LUK.22.16	For I tell you, I will never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.22.17	And when He had taken a cup and offered the 
LUK.22.18	For I tell you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine from now on, until the kingdom of God comes.” 
LUK.22.19	And when He had taken 
LUK.22.20	In the same way, He took the cup after the meal, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you. 
LUK.22.21	But look, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table. 
LUK.22.22	For indeed, the Son of Man is going as has been predetermined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!” 
LUK.22.23	So they began to discuss among themselves which of them it might be who would do this thing. 
LUK.22.24	But there was also a quarrel among them about which of them is considered the greatest. 
LUK.22.25	And 
LUK.22.26	But with you, it is not so. Rather, let the one who is greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. 
LUK.22.27	For who is greater, the one who reclines or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves. 
LUK.22.28	“You are the ones who have remained with Me in My times of testing. 
LUK.22.29	And just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, so I grant to you 
LUK.22.30	that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
LUK.22.31	“Simon, Simon! Indeed, satan has demanded to sift you all like wheat. 
LUK.22.32	But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” 
LUK.22.33	But Simon said to Him, “Master, I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death!” 
LUK.22.34	But 
LUK.22.35	And He said to them, “When I sent you out without a money pouch and travel bag and sandals, you didn’t lack anything, did you?” They said, “No, nothing.” 
LUK.22.36	Then He said to them, “But now, whoever has a money pouch must carry it as well as a travel bag. And whoever does not own a sword must sell his cloak and buy one. 
LUK.22.37	For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And he was counted with the lawless.’ For what is written about Me is being fulfilled.” 
LUK.22.38	But they said, “Master, look here! Two swords!” And He said to them, “It is enough.” 
LUK.22.39	And 
LUK.22.40	When he reached the place, He said to them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” 
LUK.22.41	And He pulled back about a stone’s throw from them, got on His knees, and began to pray, 
LUK.22.42	saying, “Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.” 
LUK.22.43	Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him. 
LUK.22.44	And in His anguish, He was praying fervently; and His sweat was like drops of blood falling down on the ground. 
LUK.22.45	When He rose up from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them asleep, exhausted from grief. 
LUK.22.46	And He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray, so that you won’t enter into temptation.”
LUK.22.47	While 
LUK.22.48	But 
LUK.22.49	When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, “Master, shall we strike with the sword?” 
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck the servant of the 
LUK.22.51	But 
LUK.22.52	Then 
LUK.22.53	Every day I was with you in the Temple, yet you did not lay a finger on Me. But this is yours—the hour and the power of darkness.” 
LUK.22.54	Then they seized 
LUK.22.55	Now they had lit a fire in the center of the courtyard and sat down together, and Peter was sitting among them. 
LUK.22.56	Then a servant girl saw him sitting at the fire. She looked straight at him and said, “This one was with Him too!” 
LUK.22.57	But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I don’t know Him!” 
LUK.22.58	A little later, another saw him and said, “You too are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” 
LUK.22.59	And about an hour later, another began to insist, saying, “Certainly this fellow was with Him, for he too is a Galilean!” 
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, ‘Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.’ 
LUK.22.62	And Peter went out and wept bitterly. 
LUK.22.63	Now the men who were guarding 
LUK.22.64	They blindfolded Him and kept asking Him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit You?” 
LUK.22.65	And reviling Him, they were saying many other things against Him.
LUK.22.66	As it become day, the elders of the people gathered together, both ruling 
LUK.22.67	“If You are 
LUK.22.68	and if I ask you, you will never answer. 
LUK.22.69	But from now on, the Son of Man is seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 
LUK.22.70	Then they all said, “Are You then 
LUK.22.71	Then they said, “What further need do we have for testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!”
LUK.23.1	Then the entire assembly got up and brought 
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this fellow subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar and saying that He Himself is Messiah—a king.” 
LUK.23.3	So Pilate questioned Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “As you say,” 
LUK.23.4	Then Pilate said to the ruling 
LUK.23.5	But they kept insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, starting from the Galilee to as far as here.” 
LUK.23.6	But when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the Man was a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	And when he learned that 
LUK.23.8	Now Herod was overjoyed when he saw 
LUK.23.9	He was questioning 
LUK.23.10	And the ruling 
LUK.23.11	Now Herod together with his soldiers were treating Him with contempt and mocking Him. They put splendid clothing on Him and sent Him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	And Herod and Pilate became friends with one another from that very day, for previously they had been enemies with one another.
LUK.23.13	Now Pilate called together the ruling 
LUK.23.14	And he said to them, “You brought this Man to me as one who incites the people to revolt. But having examined Him in your presence, I have found no case against this Man regarding what you accuse Him of doing. 
LUK.23.15	Nor did Herod, for he sent Him back to us. Indeed, He has done nothing that is worthy of death. 
LUK.23.16	Therefore I will scourge Him and release Him.”
LUK.23.17	[footnote: Some mss. add: 
LUK.23.18	But they shouted out all together, saying, “Take this fellow away! Release to us 
LUK.23.19	(He was someone who had been thrown into prison for a rebellion in the city and murder.) 
LUK.23.20	Again Pilate addressed them, wanting to release 
LUK.23.21	but they kept shouting out, saying, “Execute, execute Him!” 
LUK.23.22	And a third time he spoke to them, “Why? What evil has this One done? I have found in Him no fault deserving of death. Therefore, I will scourge and release Him.” 
LUK.23.23	But they were insistent, demanding with loud shouts that He be executed. And their voices prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	So Pilate decreed that their demand be put into effect. 
LUK.23.25	And He released the one they were asking for, the one thrown in jail for insurrection and murder. But he handed over 
LUK.23.26	As they led Him away, they grabbed a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the countryside. They placed on him the cross-beam, to carry behind 
LUK.23.27	Now a great multitude of people was following Him, including women who were mourning and singing dirges for Him. 
LUK.23.28	But 
LUK.23.29	For indeed, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are barren, and the wombs that never gave birth, and the breasts that did not feed.’ 
LUK.23.30	’Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ 
LUK.23.31	”For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?” 
LUK.23.32	Others, two evildoers, were also led away to be put to death with Him. 
LUK.23.33	When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified Him and the evildoers, one on His right and the other on His left. 
LUK.23.34	But 
LUK.23.35	The people stood there watching. And even the leaders were sneering at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Messiah of God, the Chosen One!” 
LUK.23.36	The soldiers likewise mocked Him, coming up and bringing Him sour wine, 
LUK.23.37	and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.” 
LUK.23.38	Now there was also an inscription over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
LUK.23.39	One of the evildoers hanging there was jeering at Him, saying, “Aren’t You the Messiah? Save Yourself—and us!” 
LUK.23.40	But the other one, rebuking him, replied, “Don’t you fear God, since you are under the same sentence? 
LUK.23.41	We’re getting what we deserve for our actions, and rightly so—but this One has done nothing wrong.” 
LUK.23.42	And he said, “
LUK.23.43	 said to him, “Amen, I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.”
LUK.23.44	It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour, 
LUK.23.45	for the sun died out. And the curtain of the Temple was torn in two. 
LUK.23.46	And 
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began glorifying God, saying, “Truly this was a righteous Man.” 
LUK.23.48	And all the crowds assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, began to turn back, beating their breasts. 
LUK.23.49	But all 
LUK.23.50	Now there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and righteous man. 
LUK.23.51	(He had not been in agreement with the council and their action.) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. 
LUK.23.52	This man went to Pilate and asked for 
LUK.23.53	And he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid. 
LUK.23.54	Now it was the Day of Preparation, and 
LUK.23.55	The women who had come with Him from the Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 
LUK.23.56	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. But on 
LUK.24.1	Now on the first day of the week, at daybreak, the women came to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared. 
LUK.24.2	They found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb; 
LUK.24.3	but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord 
LUK.24.4	And while they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. 
LUK.24.5	The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you search for the living among the dead? 
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but He is risen! Remember what He told you when He was still in the Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be executed, and on the third day rise up.” 
LUK.24.8	And they were reminded of His words. 
LUK.24.9	And when they returned from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven and to everyone else. 
LUK.24.10	Now it was Miriam from Magdala, Joanna, the Miriam of Jacob and others together with them who were telling these things to the emissaries. 
LUK.24.11	But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Leaning in, he sees only the linen cloths. And he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened. 
LUK.24.13	Now behold, two of them on that very day were traveling to a village named Emmaus, a distance of about seven miles from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.14	They were speaking with one another about all the things that had been happening. 
LUK.24.15	While they were talking and discussing, 
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. 
LUK.24.17	Then He said to them, “What are these things you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?” They stood still, looking gloomy. 
LUK.24.18	Then the one named Cleopas answered and said to Him, “Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that happened there in these days?” 
LUK.24.19	 said to them, “What kind of things?” And they said to Him, “The things about 
LUK.24.20	how the ruling 
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that He was the One about to redeem Israel. Besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. 
LUK.24.22	“But also some women among us amazed us. Early in the morning they were at the tomb. 
LUK.24.23	When they didn’t find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said He is alive! 
LUK.24.24	Some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said, but they did not see Him.” 
LUK.24.25	 said to them, “Oh foolish ones, so slow of heart to put your trust in all that the prophets spoke! 
LUK.24.26	Was it not necessary for Messiah to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?” 
LUK.24.27	Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures. 
LUK.24.28	They approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther on. 
LUK.24.29	But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is already gone.” So He went in to stay with them. 
LUK.24.30	And it happened that when He was reclining at the table with them, He took the 
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him, and He disappeared from them.
LUK.24.32	They said to one another, “Didn’t our heart burn within us while He was speaking with us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?” 
LUK.24.33	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven and others with them gathered together, 
LUK.24.34	saying, “The Lord is risen indeed! He has appeared to Simon!” 
LUK.24.35	Then they began telling about the events on the road and how He became recognized by them in the breaking of the 
LUK.24.36	While they were speaking of these things, 
LUK.24.37	But they were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost. 
LUK.24.38	Then He said to them, “Why are you so shaken? And why do doubts arise in your heart? 
LUK.24.39	Look at My hands and My feet—it is I Myself! Touch Me and see! For a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” 
LUK.24.40	And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 
LUK.24.41	But while they were still in disbelief due to joy and wonder, He said to them, “Do you have anything to eat here?” 
LUK.24.42	They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, 
LUK.24.43	and He took it and ate it in their presence. 
LUK.24.44	Then He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you—everything written concerning Me in the 
LUK.24.45	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, 
LUK.24.46	and He said to them, “So it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, 
LUK.24.47	and that repentance for the removal of sins is to be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.48	You are witnesses of these things. 
LUK.24.49	And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.” 
LUK.24.50	Then 
LUK.24.51	And while blessing them, He departed from them and was taken up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	After worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 
LUK.24.53	And they were continually in the Temple, praising God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	He was with God in the beginning. 
JHN.1.3	All things were made through Him, and apart from Him nothing was made that has come into being. 
JHN.1.4	In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 
JHN.1.5	The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overpowered it. 
JHN.1.6	There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. 
JHN.1.7	He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that through him everyone might believe. 
JHN.1.8	He was not the light, but he came to bear witness concerning the light. 
JHN.1.9	The true light, coming into the world, gives light to every man. 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made through Him; but the world did not know Him. 
JHN.1.11	He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. 
JHN.1.12	But whoever did receive Him, those trusting in His name, to these He gave the right to become children of God. 
JHN.1.13	They were born not of a bloodline, nor of human desire, nor of man’s will, but of God. 
JHN.1.14	And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We looked upon His glory, the glory of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
JHN.1.15	John testifies about Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘The One who comes after me is above me, because He existed before me.’” 
JHN.1.16	Out of His fullness, we have all received grace on top of grace. 
JHN.1.17	 was given through Moses; grace and truth came through 
JHN.1.18	No one has ever seen God; but the one and only God, in the Father’s embrace, has made Him known. 
JHN.1.19	This is John’s testimony, when the Judean leaders sent 
JHN.1.20	He openly admitted and did not deny; he admitted, “I am not the Messiah.” 
JHN.1.21	“What then? Are you Elijah?” they asked him. “I am not,” said John. “Are you the Prophet?” “No,” he answered. 
JHN.1.22	So they said to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 
JHN.1.23	He said, “I am ‘the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of 
JHN.1.24	Now those sent were from the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	They asked him, “If you’re not the Messiah, Elijah, or the Prophet, why then are you immersing?” 
JHN.1.26	“I immerse in water,” John answered. “Among you stands One you do not know, 
JHN.1.27	coming after me, whose sandals I’m not worthy to untie.” 
JHN.1.28	These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing. 
JHN.1.29	The next day, John sees 
JHN.1.30	This is the One about whom I told you, ‘He who comes after me is above me, because He was before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I didn’t know Him, but I came immersing with water so that He might be revealed to Israel.” 
JHN.1.32	Then John testified, “I have seen the 
JHN.1.33	I did not know Him; but the One who sent me to immerse in water said to me, ‘The One on whom you see the 
JHN.1.34	And I have seen and testified that this is 
JHN.1.35	Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples 
JHN.1.36	and watched 
JHN.1.37	The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed 
JHN.1.38	 turned around and saw them following. He said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?” 
JHN.1.39	“Come and see,” 
JHN.1.40	Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John speak and followed 
JHN.1.41	First he finds his own brother Simon and tells him, “We’ve found the Messiah!” (which is translated Anointed One). 
JHN.1.42	Andrew brought Simon to 
JHN.1.43	The next day, 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. 
JHN.1.45	Philip finds Nathanael and tells him, “We’ve found the One that Moses in the 
JHN.1.46	“Natzeret!” Nathanael answered. “Can anything good come from there?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” 
JHN.1.47	 saw Nathanael coming toward Him. He said, “Look, a true Israelite! There’s nothing false in him.” 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael said to Him, “How do you know me?” 
JHN.1.49	“Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are 
JHN.1.50	“Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe?” 
JHN.1.51	And He said, “Amen, 
JHN.2.1	On the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in the Galilee. 
JHN.2.2	and 
JHN.2.3	When the wine ran out, 
JHN.2.4	 said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with you and Me? My hour hasn’t come yet.” 
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” 
JHN.2.6	Now there were six stone jars, used for the Jewish ritual of purification, each holding two to three measures. 
JHN.2.7	 said to them, “Fill the jars with water!” So they filled them up to the top. 
JHN.2.8	Then He said to them, “Take some water out, and give it to the headwaiter.” And they brought it. 
JHN.2.9	Now the headwaiter did not know where it had come from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. As the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, he calls the bridegroom 
JHN.2.10	and says to him, “Everyone brings out the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, then the worse. But you’ve reserved the good wine until now!” 
JHN.2.11	 did this, the first of the signs, in Cana of the Galilee—He revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
JHN.2.12	After this 
JHN.2.13	The Jewish feast of Passover was near, so 
JHN.2.14	In the Temple, He found the merchants selling oxen, sheep, and doves; also the moneychangers sitting there. 
JHN.2.15	Then He made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the Temple, both the sheep and oxen. He dumped out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned their tables. 
JHN.2.16	To those selling doves, He said, “Get these things out of here! Stop making My Father’s house a marketplace!” 
JHN.2.17	His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your House will consume Me!” 
JHN.2.18	The Judean leaders responded, “What sign do You show us, since You are doing these things?” 
JHN.2.19	“Destroy this Temple,” 
JHN.2.20	The Judean leaders then said to Him, “Forty-six years this Temple was being built, and You will raise it up in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	But He was talking about the temple of His body. 
JHN.2.22	So after He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He was talking about this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that 
JHN.2.23	Now when He was in Jerusalem for the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, seeing the signs He was doing. 
JHN.2.24	But 
JHN.2.25	He did not need anyone to testify about man, for He knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	Now there was a man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewish people. 
JHN.3.2	He came to 
JHN.3.3	 answered him, “Amen, 
JHN.3.4	“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus said to Him. “He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?” 
JHN.3.5	 answered, “Amen, 
JHN.3.6	What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
JHN.3.7	Do not be surprised that I said to you, ‘You all must be born from above.’ 
JHN.3.8	The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”
JHN.3.9	“How can these things happen?” Nicodemus said. 
JHN.3.10	 answered him, “You’re a teacher of Israel and you do not understand these things? 
JHN.3.11	Amen, 
JHN.3.12	If you do not believe the earthly things I told you, how will you believe when I tell you about heavenly things? 
JHN.3.13	No one has gone up into heaven except the One who came down from heaven—the Son of Man. 
JHN.3.14	Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 
JHN.3.15	so that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life! 
JHN.3.16	“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
JHN.3.17	God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. 
JHN.3.18	The one who believes in Him is not condemned; but whoever does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not put his trust in the name of the one and only 
JHN.3.19	“Now this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness instead of the light, because their deeds were evil. 
JHN.3.20	For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed. 
JHN.3.21	But whoever practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be made known that his deeds have been accomplished in God.” 
JHN.3.22	Afterwards, 
JHN.3.23	Now John also was immersing at Aenon near Salim, because much water was there and many were coming and being immersed; 
JHN.3.24	for John had not yet been thrown into prison. 
JHN.3.25	Now an argument came up between John’s disciples and a Judean concerning purification. 
JHN.3.26	They came to John and said, “Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—look, He is immersing, and all are coming to Him!” 
JHN.3.27	John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah,’ but rather, ‘I am sent before Him.’ 
JHN.3.29	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the best man rejoices when he stands and hears the bridegroom’s voice. So now my joy is complete! 
JHN.3.30	He must increase, while I must decrease.” 
JHN.3.31	The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaks. The One who comes from heaven is above all. 
JHN.3.32	And what He has seen and heard, He testifies to that; yet no one receives His testimony. 
JHN.3.33	Whoever receives His testimony has certified that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	The One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has given everything into His hand. 
JHN.3.36	He who trusts in the Son has eternal life. He who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
JHN.4.1	Now 
JHN.4.2	(Although 
JHN.4.3	So He left Judea and went back again to the Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	But He needed to pass through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	So He comes to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	Now Jacob’s well was there. So 
JHN.4.7	A Samaritan woman comes to draw water. “Give me a drink,” 
JHN.4.8	for His disciples had gone away to the town to buy food. 
JHN.4.9	Then the Samaritan woman tells Him, “How is it that You, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?” (For Jewish people don’t deal with Samaritans.) 
JHN.4.10	 replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” 
JHN.4.11	“Sir,” the woman tells Him, “You don’t have a bucket, and the well is deep. Then from where do You get this living water? 
JHN.4.12	You’re not greater than our father Jacob, are You? He gave us this well. He drank out of it himself, with his sons and his cattle.” 
JHN.4.13	 replied to her, “Everyone who drinks from this water will get thirsty again. 
JHN.4.14	But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty. The water that I give him will become a fountain of water within him, springing up to eternal life!” 
JHN.4.15	“Sir,” the woman tells Him, “give me this water, so I won’t get thirsty or have to come all the way here to draw water!” 
JHN.4.16	He tells her, “Go call your husband, and then come back here.” 
JHN.4.17	“I don’t have a husband,” the woman replied. 
JHN.4.18	For you’ve had five husbands, and the man you have now isn’t your husband. This you’ve spoken truthfully!” 
JHN.4.19	“Sir,” the woman tells Him, “I see that You are a prophet! 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you all say that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.” 
JHN.4.21	 tells her, “Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 
JHN.4.22	You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. 
JHN.4.23	But an hour is coming—it is here now—when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people as His worshipers. 
JHN.4.24	God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.” 
JHN.4.25	The woman tells Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called the Anointed One.) When He comes, He will explain everything to us.” 
JHN.4.26	 tells her, “I—the One speaking to you—I am.”
JHN.4.27	At this moment, His disciples came back. They were amazed that He was speaking with a woman. Yet no one said, “What do You want?” or “Why are You speaking with her?” 
JHN.4.28	So the woman left her water jar and went back to the town. She tells the people, 
JHN.4.29	“Come see a man who told me everything I ever did! He couldn’t be the Messiah, could He?” 
JHN.4.30	The people left the town and began coming to Him. 
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile, the disciples were pressing Him, “Rabbi, eat!” 
JHN.4.32	But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” 
JHN.4.33	So the disciples were saying to each other, “No one brought Him food to eat, did they?” 
JHN.4.34	 tells them, “My food is to do the will of the One who sent Me and to accomplish His work. 
JHN.4.35	Don’t you say, ‘Four more months, and then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields! They are white and ready for harvest. 
JHN.4.36	“The reaper receives a reward and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the sower and reaper may rejoice together. 
JHN.4.37	For the saying is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ 
JHN.4.38	I sent you to reap what you haven’t worked for. Others have worked hard, and you have joined in their work.” 
JHN.4.39	Many of the Samaritans from that town put their trust in Him because of the word of the woman testifying, “He told me everything I ever did!” 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to Him, they kept asking Him to stay with them. He stayed there two days, 
JHN.4.41	and many more believed because of His word. 
JHN.4.42	They kept telling the woman, “It’s no longer because of your words that we believe. We’ve heard for ourselves! Now we know that this really is the Savior of the world!”
JHN.4.43	After the two days, He went on from there into the Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	Now 
JHN.4.45	But when He came into the Galilee, they welcomed Him. For they had seen all He had done at the feast in Jerusalem, since they also had gone up to celebrate. 
JHN.4.46	So He went again to Cana of the Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. Now there was a nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum. 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that 
JHN.4.48	Then 
JHN.4.49	The nobleman said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!” 
JHN.4.50	 tells him, “Go! Your son lives!” The man believed the word that 
JHN.4.51	While on his way down, his servants met him, saying that his son was living. 
JHN.4.52	So he asked them the hour when the boy began to get better. They said, “The fever left him yesterday at about the seventh hour.” 
JHN.4.53	Then the father realized that it was the same hour 
JHN.4.54	 did this as the second sign, after He had come again from Judea into the Galilee.
JHN.5.1	After this there was a Jewish feast, and 
JHN.5.2	Now in Jerusalem there is a pool by the sheep gate, called Bethzatha in Aramaic, which has five porches. 
JHN.5.3	In these a crowd of invalids was lying around—blind, lame, disabled.
JHN.5.5	Now a certain man had been an invalid there for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	Seeing him lying there and knowing he had been that way a long time, 
JHN.5.7	The invalid answered Him, “Sir, I have nobody to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I’m trying to get in, somebody else steps down before me!” 
JHN.5.8	 tells him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!” 
JHN.5.9	Immediately, the man was healed! He took up his mat and started walking around. Now that day was Shabbat, 
JHN.5.10	so Judean leaders were saying to the man who was healed, “It’s Shabbat! It’s not permitted for you to carry your mat.” 
JHN.5.11	But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” 
JHN.5.12	They asked him, “Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?” 
JHN.5.13	But the man who had been healed didn’t know who it was, for 
JHN.5.14	Afterwards, 
JHN.5.15	The man left and told the Judean leaders that it was 
JHN.5.16	Because 
JHN.5.17	But 
JHN.5.18	So for this reason the Judean leaders kept trying even harder to kill Him—because He was not only breaking Shabbat, but also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. 
JHN.5.19	Therefore 
JHN.5.20	For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He does. He will show Him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. 
JHN.5.21	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever He wants. 
JHN.5.22	The Father does not judge anyone, but has handed over all judgment to the Son 
JHN.5.23	so that all should honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. 
JHN.5.24	“Amen, 
JHN.5.25	Amen, 
JHN.5.26	For just as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. 
JHN.5.27	Also He has given the Son authority to judge, because He is the Son of Man. 
JHN.5.28	“Do not be amazed at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice 
JHN.5.29	and come out! Those who have done good will come to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil will come to a resurrection of judgment. 
JHN.5.30	I can do nothing on My own. Just as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, for I do not seek My own will, but the will of the One who sent Me.”
JHN.5.31	“If I testify about Myself, My witness is not valid. 
JHN.5.32	There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony He gives is true. 
JHN.5.33	You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. 
JHN.5.34	I do not receive the testimony of man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. 
JHN.5.35	He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for a while in his light. 
JHN.5.36	“But the testimony I have is greater than that from John. The works the Father has given Me to finish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me. 
JHN.5.37	And the Father who sent Me has testified concerning Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form. 
JHN.5.38	Nor do you have His Word living in you, because you do not trust the One He sent. 
JHN.5.39	You search the Scriptures because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. It is these that testify about Me. 
JHN.5.40	Yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life! 
JHN.5.41	“I do not accept glory from men. 
JHN.5.42	But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. 
JHN.5.43	I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me. But if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. 
JHN.5.44	How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that comes from God alone? 
JHN.5.45	“Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. 
JHN.5.46	For if you were believing Moses, you would believe Me—because he wrote about Me. 
JHN.5.47	But since you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”
JHN.6.1	Afterwards, 
JHN.6.2	A large crowd kept following Him, because they were watching the signs He was performing on the sick. 
JHN.6.3	Then 
JHN.6.4	Passover, the Jewish feast, was near. 
JHN.6.5	Lifting up His eyes and seeing a large crowd coming to Him, 
JHN.6.6	Now 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii isn’t enough to buy bread for each to get a little bit!” 
JHN.6.8	One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, 
JHN.6.9	“There’s a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish—but what’s that for so many?” 
JHN.6.10	 said, “Make the people recline.” There was much grass in the area. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number. 
JHN.6.11	Then 
JHN.6.12	When the people were full, 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had finished eating. 
JHN.6.14	When the people saw the sign that 
JHN.6.15	Realizing that they were about to come and seize Him by force to make Him king, 
JHN.6.16	Now when evening came, 
JHN.6.17	Getting into a boat, they set out to cross the sea toward Capernaum. By now it had become dark, and still 
JHN.6.18	A great wind began to blow, stirring up the sea. 
JHN.6.19	After they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they catch sight of 
JHN.6.20	But 
JHN.6.21	Then they wanted to take Him into the boat, and right away the boat reached the shore where they were headed. 
JHN.6.22	The next day, the crowd remaining on the other side of the sea realized that no other boat had been there except the one, and that 
JHN.6.23	Some other boats from Tiberias came close to the place where they had eaten the bread after the Master had given thanks. 
JHN.6.24	So when the crowd realized that neither 
JHN.6.25	When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” 
JHN.6.26	 responded to them, “Amen, 
JHN.6.27	Don’t work for food that spoils, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on Him, God the Father has put the seal of approval.” 
JHN.6.28	Then they said to Him, “What shall we do to perform the works of God?” 
JHN.6.29	 answered them, “This is the work of God, to trust in the One He sent.” 
JHN.6.30	So they said to Him, “Then what sign do You perform, so that we may see and believe You? What work do You do? 
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate the 
JHN.6.32	 answered them, “Amen, 
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God is the One coming down from heaven and giving life to the world.” 
JHN.6.34	So they said to Him, “Sir, give us this bread from now on!” 
JHN.6.35	 said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in Me will never be thirsty. 
JHN.6.36	But I told you that you have seen Me, yet you do not believe. 
JHN.6.37	Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and anyone coming to Me I will never reject. 
JHN.6.38	For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of the One who sent Me. 
JHN.6.39	“Now this is the will of the One who sent Me, that I lose not one of all He has given Me, but raise each one on the last day. 
JHN.6.40	For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and trusts in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.” 
JHN.6.41	Some of the Judeans started to grumble about Him, because He said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 
JHN.6.42	They were saying, “Isn’t this 
JHN.6.43	 answered, “Stop grumbling among yourselves! 
JHN.6.44	No one can come to Me unless My Father who sent Me draws him—and I will raise him up on the last day. 
JHN.6.45	It is written in the Prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has listened and learned from the Father comes to Me. 
JHN.6.46	Not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God—He has seen the Father. 
JHN.6.47	“Amen, 
JHN.6.48	I am the bread of life. 
JHN.6.49	Your fathers ate the 
JHN.6.50	This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat and not die. 
JHN.6.51	I am the living bread, which came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. This bread is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” 
JHN.6.52	Then the Jews began arguing with one another, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?” 
JHN.6.53	So 
JHN.6.54	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. 
JHN.6.55	“For My flesh is real food and My blood is real drink. 
JHN.6.56	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. 
JHN.6.57	Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so the one who eats of Me will also live because of Me. 
JHN.6.58	This is the bread that came down from heaven—not like the bread your fathers ate and then died. He who eats this bread will live forever.” 
JHN.6.59	He said these things while teaching at the synagogue in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	So when many of His disciples heard this, they said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can listen to it?” 
JHN.6.61	But 
JHN.6.62	Then what if you see the Son of Man going back up to the place where He was before? 
JHN.6.63	It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no benefit. The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and are life! 
JHN.6.64	Yet some of you do not trust.” 
JHN.6.65	Then He told them, “For this reason I’ve told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.” 
JHN.6.66	From this time, many of His disciples left and quit walking with Him. 
JHN.6.67	So 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life! 
JHN.6.69	We have trusted and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.” 
JHN.6.70	 answered them, “Didn’t I choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is the adversary!” 
JHN.6.71	Now He was speaking of Judah, the son of Simon of Kriot—for he, one of the Twelve, was about to betray Him.
JHN.7.1	After these events, 
JHN.7.2	Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near. 
JHN.7.3	Therefore His brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so Your disciples also may see the works You are doing. 
JHN.7.4	No one who wants to be well known does everything in secret. If You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world!” 
JHN.7.5	For not even His brothers were trusting in Him. 
JHN.7.6	Therefore 
JHN.7.7	The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify that its works are evil. 
JHN.7.8	You go on up to the Feast. I’m not going to this feast, because My time hasn’t yet fully come.” 
JHN.7.9	After saying these things, He stayed in the Galilee. 
JHN.7.10	But after His brothers went to the Feast, He also went, not openly but secretly. 
JHN.7.11	Then the Judean leaders were searching for Him at the Feast and kept asking, “Where is that fellow?” 
JHN.7.12	There was a lot of murmuring about Him in the crowds. Some were saying, “He is good.” But others were saying, “Not so! He leads the people astray.” 
JHN.7.13	Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Judean leaders. 
JHN.7.14	About halfway through the Feast, 
JHN.7.15	Then the Judean leaders were amazed, saying, “How does this man know so much, having never been taught?” 
JHN.7.16	 answered, “My teaching is not from Me, but from Him who sent Me. 
JHN.7.17	If anyone wants to do His will, he will know whether My teaching comes from God or it is Myself speaking. 
JHN.7.18	Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true and there is no unrighteousness in Him. 
JHN.7.19	Hasn’t Moses given you the 
JHN.7.20	The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who’s trying to kill you?” 
JHN.7.21	 answered, “I did one good work, and all of you are amazed. 
JHN.7.22	Because Moses has given you circumcision (though it is not from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a man on Shabbat. 
JHN.7.23	If a man receives circumcision on 
JHN.7.24	Do not judge by appearance, but judge righteously.” 
JHN.7.25	Then some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, “Isn’t this the person they’re trying to kill? 
JHN.7.26	Look, He speaks openly and they’re saying nothing to Him. Can it be that the leaders know He is the Messiah? 
JHN.7.27	But we know where this person is from. But the Messiah, whenever He may come, no one knows where He is from.” 
JHN.7.28	Then, while teaching in the Temple courts, 
JHN.7.29	but I know Him because I am from Him and He sent Me.” 
JHN.7.30	Then they were trying to seize Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	Yet many from the crowd believed in Him and were saying, “When the Messiah comes, He won’t perform more signs than this person has, will He?” 
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard people in the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the ruling 
JHN.7.33	 said, “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me. 
JHN.7.34	You will look for Me but will not find Me. Where I am, you cannot come.” 
JHN.7.35	The Judean leaders then said among themselves, “Where is this person about to go that we shall not find Him? He’s not going to the Diaspora to teach the Greeks, is He? 
JHN.7.36	What did He mean by saying, ‘You will look for Me but will not find Me. Where I am, you cannot come’?”
JHN.7.37	On the last and greatest day of the Feast, 
JHN.7.38	Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture says, ‘out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’” 
JHN.7.39	Now He said this about the 
JHN.7.40	When they heard these words, some of the crowd said, “This man really is the Prophet.” 
JHN.7.41	Others were saying, “This is the Messiah.” Still others were saying, “The Messiah doesn’t come from the Galilee, does He? 
JHN.7.42	Didn’t the Scripture say that the Messiah comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, David’s town?” 
JHN.7.43	So a division arose in the crowd because of 
JHN.7.44	Some wanted to capture Him, but no one laid hands on Him. 
JHN.7.45	Then the guards returned to the ruling 
JHN.7.46	“Never has anyone spoken like this man,” the guards answered. 
JHN.7.47	The Pharisees responded, “You haven’t been led astray also, have you? 
JHN.7.48	Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him? 
JHN.7.49	No, but this mob that doesn’t know the 
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus, the one who had come to 
JHN.7.51	“Our 
JHN.7.52	They answered him, “You aren’t from the Galilee too, are you? Search, and see that no prophet comes out of the Galilee!” 
JHN.7.53	Then everyone went to his own house.
JHN.8.1	But 
JHN.8.2	At dawn, He came again into the Temple. All the people were coming to Him, and He sat down and began to teach them. 
JHN.8.3	The 
JHN.8.4	they say to 
JHN.8.5	In the 
JHN.8.6	Now they were saying this to trap Him, so that they would have grounds to accuse Him. But 
JHN.8.7	When they kept asking Him, He stood up and said, “The sinless one among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.” 
JHN.8.8	Then He knelt down again and continued writing on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	Now when they heard, they began to leave, one by one, the oldest ones first, until 
JHN.8.10	Straightening up, 
JHN.8.11	“No one, Sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” 
JHN.8.12	 spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. The one who follows Me will no longer walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 
JHN.8.13	Then the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself, so Your testimony is not valid.” 
JHN.8.14	 answered them, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid. For I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don’t know where I come from or where I am going.
JHN.8.15	You judge according to the flesh, but I do not judge anyone. 
JHN.8.16	Yet even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because it is not I alone but I with the Father who sent Me. 
JHN.8.17	Even in your 
JHN.8.18	I am one witness for Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness for Me.” 
JHN.8.19	Then they said to Him, “Where is your Father?” 
JHN.8.20	He spoke these words in the treasury while teaching in the Temple, but no one arrested Him because His hour had not yet come. 
JHN.8.21	Then again 
JHN.8.22	“He won’t kill Himself, will He?” the Judeans asked. “Is that why He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?” 
JHN.8.23	 said, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. 
JHN.8.24	Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins. If you don’t believe that I am, you will die in your sins.” 
JHN.8.25	So they asked Him, “Who are you?” 
JHN.8.26	I have much to say and judge about you. But the One who sent Me is true, and I tell the world what I heard from Him.” 
JHN.8.27	They didn’t understand that He was talking to them about the Father. 
JHN.8.28	So 
JHN.8.29	The One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to Him.” 
JHN.8.30	As He was speaking these things, many people put their trust in Him. 
JHN.8.31	Then 
JHN.8.32	You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free!” 
JHN.8.33	They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s children and have never been slaves to anyone! How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” 
JHN.8.34	 answered them, “Amen, 
JHN.8.35	Now the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son abides forever. 
JHN.8.36	So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed! 
JHN.8.37	I know you are Abraham’s children; yet you are trying to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. 
JHN.8.38	I tell of what I have seen with the Father; so also you do what you heard from the Father.” 
JHN.8.39	“Abraham is our father,” they replied to Him. 
JHN.8.40	But now you are seeking to kill Me—a Man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do! 
JHN.8.41	You are doing the deeds of your father.” They said to Him, “We were not born as illegitimate children—we have one Father, God Himself!” 
JHN.8.42	 said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for from God I came and now I am here. For I have not come on My own, but He sent Me. 
JHN.8.43	Why don’t you understand My speech? Because you’re not able to hear My word! 
JHN.8.44	You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks lies he is just being himself—for he is a liar and the father of lies. 
JHN.8.45	“But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me. 
JHN.8.46	Which one of you convicts Me of sinning? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe Me? 
JHN.8.47	He who belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you don’t hear is because you do not belong to God.” 
JHN.8.48	The Judean leaders responded, “Aren’t we right to say you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” 
JHN.8.49	 answered, “I do not have a demon! I honor My Father, yet you dishonor Me. 
JHN.8.50	But I do not seek My own glory; there is One who is seeking and judging. 
JHN.8.51	Amen, 
JHN.8.52	“Now we know You have a demon!” the Judean leaders said to Him. “Abraham and the prophets died. Yet You say, ‘If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death.’ 
JHN.8.53	You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are You? The prophets also died! Who do You make Yourself out to be?” 
JHN.8.54	 answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father who gives Me glory—the One of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ 
JHN.8.55	Yet you do not know Him, but I know Him. If I say I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you. Yet I do know Him and keep His Word. 
JHN.8.56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; he saw it and was thrilled.” 
JHN.8.57	Then the Judeans said to Him, “You’re not even fifty years old and you’ve seen Abraham?” 
JHN.8.58	 answered, “Amen, 
JHN.8.59	Then they picked up stones to throw at Him, but 
JHN.9.1	As 
JHN.9.2	His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?” 
JHN.9.3	 answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that the works of God might be brought to light in him. 
JHN.9.4	We must do the work of the One who sent Me, so long as it is day! Night is coming when no one can work. 
JHN.9.5	While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” 
JHN.9.6	Having said these things, He spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud on the blind man’s eyes. 
JHN.9.7	He told him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which is translated Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. 
JHN.9.8	Therefore his neighbors and those who had seen him as a beggar kept saying, “Isn’t this the one who used to sit and beg?” 
JHN.9.9	“This is the one!” some said. “No, but it looks like him,” said others. But the man himself kept saying, “I am!” 
JHN.9.10	So they asked him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” 
JHN.9.11	He answered, “The Man who is called 
JHN.9.12	“Where is He?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said. 
JHN.9.13	They bring to the Pharisees the man who once was blind. 
JHN.9.14	Now the day was 
JHN.9.15	So again the Pharisees were asking him how he received his sight. He responded, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see!” 
JHN.9.16	So some of the Pharisees began saying, “This man isn’t from God, because He doesn’t keep Shabbat!” But others were saying, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So there was a split among them. 
JHN.9.17	Again they say to the blind man, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” And he said, “He’s a prophet.” 
JHN.9.18	So the Judean leaders didn’t believe that he had been blind and received his sight until they called his parents. 
JHN.9.19	They questioned them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he see now?” 
JHN.9.20	Then his parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 
JHN.9.21	We don’t know how he now sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him—he’s old enough. He will speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Judean leaders. For the Judean leaders had already agreed that anyone who professed 
JHN.9.23	That’s why his parents said, “He’s old enough—ask him.” 
JHN.9.24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!” 
JHN.9.25	The man replied, “I don’t know whether He’s a sinner. One thing I do know is that I was blind, but now I see!” 
JHN.9.26	So they asked him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?” 
JHN.9.27	“I told you already and you didn’t listen!” the man responded. “What, do you want to hear it again? You don’t want to become His disciples too, do you?” 
JHN.9.28	They railed at him and said, “You’re a disciple of that One, but we’re disciples of Moses! 
JHN.9.29	We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this fellow, we don’t know where He is from.” 
JHN.9.30	The man replied to them, “That’s amazing! You don’t know where He is from, yet He opened my eyes! 
JHN.9.31	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners; but if anyone fears Him and does His will, He hears this one. 
JHN.9.32	Since the beginning of the world, no one has ever heard that anyone has opened the eyes of a man born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, He couldn’t do anything.” 
JHN.9.34	They replied to him, “You were born completely in sin, and you’re teaching us?” And they threw him out.
JHN.9.35	 heard that they had thrown him out. Finding him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 
JHN.9.36	The man answered, “Who is He, Sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in Him!” 
JHN.9.37	 said, “You have seen Him—He is the One speaking with you.” 
JHN.9.38	He said, “Lord, I believe!” And he worshiped Him. 
JHN.9.39	 said, “For judgment I came into this world, so that those who don’t see may see, and the ones who do see may become blind.” 
JHN.9.40	Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard Him say this and asked, “We’re not blind too, are we?” 
JHN.9.41	 said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, ‘We see.’ So your sin remains.”
JHN.10.1	“Amen, 
JHN.10.2	But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
JHN.10.3	To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice. The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 
JHN.10.4	“When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them; and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. 
JHN.10.5	They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” 
JHN.10.6	 told them this parable, but they did not understand what He was telling them. 
JHN.10.7	So 
JHN.10.8	All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 
JHN.10.9	I am the gate! If anyone comes in through Me, he will be saved. He will come and go and find pasture. 
JHN.10.10	The thief comes only to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I have come that they might have life, and have it abundantly! 
JHN.10.11	“I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.12	The hired worker is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees. Then the wolf snatches and scatters the sheep. 
JHN.10.13	The man is only a hired hand and does not care about the sheep. 
JHN.10.14	“I am the Good Shepherd. I know My own and My own know Me, 
JHN.10.15	just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.16	I have other sheep that are not from this fold; those also I must lead, and they will listen to My voice. So there shall be one flock, one Shepherd. 
JHN.10.17	“For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life, so that I may take it up again. 
JHN.10.18	No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it up again. This command I received from My Father.” 
JHN.10.19	Again a division arose among the Judeans because of these words. 
JHN.10.20	Many of them were saying, “He has a demon. He’s insane! Why listen to Him?” 
JHN.10.21	Others said, “These are not the sayings of someone who is plagued by a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?”
JHN.10.22	Then came 
JHN.10.23	 was walking in the Temple around Solomon’s Colonnade. 
JHN.10.24	Then the Judean leaders surrounded Him, saying, “How long will You hold us in suspense? If You are the Messiah, tell us outright!” 
JHN.10.25	 answered them, “I told you, but you don’t believe! The works I do in My Father’s name testify concerning Me. 
JHN.10.26	But you don’t believe, because you are not My sheep. 
JHN.10.27	My sheep hear My voice. I know them, and they follow Me. 
JHN.10.28	I give them eternal life! They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of My hand. 
JHN.10.29	My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all. And no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 
JHN.10.30	I and the Father are one.” 
JHN.10.31	Again the Judean leaders picked up stones to stone Him. 
JHN.10.32	 answered them, “I’ve shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone Me?” 
JHN.10.33	The Judean leaders answered, “We aren’t stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy. Though You are a man, You make Yourself God!” 
JHN.10.34	 answered them, “Isn’t it written in your Writings, ‘I have said you are gods’? 
JHN.10.35	If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the Word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), 
JHN.10.36	do you say of Him, the One the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You speak blasphemy,’ because I said, ‘I am 
JHN.10.37	“If I don’t do the works of My Father, don’t believe Me! 
JHN.10.38	But if I do, even if you don’t trust Me, trust the deeds. Then you may come to know and continue to understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.” 
JHN.10.39	Therefore they tried to capture Him again, but He escaped from their hand. 
JHN.10.40	Again He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first started immersing, and He stayed there. 
JHN.10.41	Many people came to Him and were saying, “John performed no sign, but all John said about this man was true.” 
JHN.10.42	And many trusted in Him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Miriam and her sister Martha. 
JHN.11.2	This was the same Miriam who anointed the Master with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick. 
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent a word to 
JHN.11.4	When 
JHN.11.5	Now 
JHN.11.6	However, when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two more days. 
JHN.11.7	Then after this, He said to His disciples, “Let’s go up to Judea again.” 
JHN.11.8	“Rabbi,” the disciples say to Him, “just now the Judean leaders were trying to stone You! And You’re going back there again?” 
JHN.11.9	 answered, “Aren’t there twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of the world. 
JHN.11.10	But if a man should walk around at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” 
JHN.11.11	After He said this, He tells them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I’m going there to wake him up.” 
JHN.11.12	So the disciples said to Him, “Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will get better.” 
JHN.11.13	Now 
JHN.11.14	Then 
JHN.11.15	I’m glad for your sake I wasn’t there, so that you may believe. Anyway, let’s go to him!” 
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas called the Twin said to the other disciples, “Let’s go too, so that we may die with Him!”
JHN.11.17	So when 
JHN.11.18	Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, 
JHN.11.19	and many of the Judeans had come to Martha and Miriam to console them about their brother. 
JHN.11.20	When Martha heard that 
JHN.11.21	Martha said to 
JHN.11.22	But I know, even now, that whatever You may ask of God, He will give You.” 
JHN.11.23	 said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 
JHN.11.24	Martha said to Him, “I know, he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” 
JHN.11.25	 said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life! Whoever believes in Me, even if he dies, shall live. 
JHN.11.26	And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?” 
JHN.11.27	She says to Him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, 
JHN.11.28	After she said this, she left and secretly told her sister Miriam, “The Teacher is here, and He’s calling for you.” 
JHN.11.29	As soon as Miriam heard, she quickly got up and was coming to Him. 
JHN.11.30	Now 
JHN.11.31	The Judeans, who were with Miriam in the house and comforting her, seeing how quickly she got up and went out, followed her. They thought she was going to the tomb to weep there. 
JHN.11.32	So when Miriam came to where 
JHN.11.33	When 
JHN.11.34	“Where have you laid him?” He asked. “Come and see, Master,” they tell Him. 
JHN.11.35	 wept. 
JHN.11.36	So the Judeans said, “See how He loved him!” 
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “Couldn’t this One, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have also kept this man from dying?”
JHN.11.38	So 
JHN.11.39	 says, “Roll away the stone!” Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to Him, “Master, by this time he stinks! He’s been dead for four days!” 
JHN.11.40	 says to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 
JHN.11.41	So they rolled away the stone. 
JHN.11.42	I knew that You always hear Me; but because of this crowd standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.” 
JHN.11.43	And when He had said this, He cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” 
JHN.11.44	He who had been dead came out, wrapped in burial clothes binding his hands and feet, with a cloth over his face. And 
JHN.11.45	Therefore many of the Judeans, who had come to Miriam and had seen what 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what 
JHN.11.47	So the ruling 
JHN.11.48	If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our holy place and our nation.” 
JHN.11.49	But one of them, Caiaphas, who was 
JHN.11.50	You don’t take into account that it is better for you that one man die for the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed.” 
JHN.11.51	Now he did not say this by himself; but as the 
JHN.11.52	And not for the nation only, but also so that He might gather together into one the scattered children of God. 
JHN.11.53	So from that day on, they plotted to kill Him. 
JHN.11.54	Therefore 
JHN.11.55	Now the Jewish Passover was near; and many people went up out of the regions to Jerusalem before Passover, to purify themselves. 
JHN.11.56	So they were searching for 
JHN.11.57	Now the ruling 
JHN.12.1	Six days before Passover, 
JHN.12.2	So they prepared a dinner there for 
JHN.12.3	Then Miriam took a pound of very expensive oil of pure nard and anointed 
JHN.12.4	But Judah from Kriot, one of His disciples, the one who was about to betray Him, said, 
JHN.12.5	“Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?” 
JHN.12.6	Now he said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. Since he had the moneybox, he used to steal from what was put in it. 
JHN.12.7	Therefore 
JHN.12.8	You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have Me.” 
JHN.12.9	Now a large crowd of Judeans knew He was there and came, not only for 
JHN.12.10	So the ruling 
JHN.12.11	because on account of him many of the Jewish people were going and putting their trust in 
JHN.12.12	The next day, the huge crowd that had come up for the feast heard that 
JHN.12.13	So they took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting, “‘
JHN.12.14	Finding a young donkey, 
JHN.12.15	“Fear not, Daughter of Zion! Look! Your King is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt.” 
JHN.12.16	His disciples did not understand these things at first. But when 
JHN.12.17	So the crowd, which had been with 
JHN.12.18	It was also for this reason that the crowd came out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. 
JHN.12.19	So the Pharisees said to each other, “You see that you can’t do anything. Look, the whole world has taken off after Him!”
JHN.12.20	Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast. 
JHN.12.21	These came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in the Galilee. “Sir,” they said, “we want to see 
JHN.12.22	Philip comes and tells Andrew; Andrew and Philip come and tell 
JHN.12.23	 answers them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified! 
JHN.12.24	Amen, 
JHN.12.25	He who loves his life will lose it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it forever. 
JHN.12.26	If any man serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there also will My servant be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. 
JHN.12.27	“Now My soul is troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But it was for this reason I came to this hour. 
JHN.12.28	Father, glorify Your name!” Then a voice came out of heaven, “I have glorified it, and again I will glorify it!” 
JHN.12.29	Therefore the crowd that was standing there and heard it was saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to Him.” 
JHN.12.30	 responded, “This voice hasn’t come for My sake, but for yours. 
JHN.12.31	Now is the judgment of this world! Now the prince of this world will be driven out! 
JHN.12.32	And as I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.” 
JHN.12.33	He said this to show the kind of death He was about to die. 
JHN.12.34	The crowd answered Him, “We’ve heard from Scripture that the Messiah remains forever. How can You say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”
JHN.12.35	Therefore 
JHN.12.36	While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become sons of light.” 
JHN.12.37	But even though He had performed so many signs before them, they weren’t trusting in Him. 
JHN.12.38	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet, who said, “
JHN.12.39	For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah also said, 
JHN.12.40	“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they might not see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts and turn back, and I would heal them.” 
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke of Him. 
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless many, even among the leaders, put their trust in Him. But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. 
JHN.12.44	 cried out, “Whoever puts trust in Me believes not in Me but in the One who sent Me! 
JHN.12.45	And whoever beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me. 
JHN.12.46	As light I have come into the world, so that everyone who trusts in Me should not remain in darkness. 
JHN.12.47	“If anyone hears My words but doesn’t keep them, I do not judge him; for I came to save the world, not to judge the world. 
JHN.12.48	The one who rejects Me and doesn’t receive My words has a judge; the word I spoke will judge him on the last day. 
JHN.12.49	For I did not speak on My own, but the Father Himself who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and speak. 
JHN.12.50	And I know that His commandment is life everlasting. Therefore what I say, I say just as the Father has told Me.”
JHN.13.1	Now it was just before the feast of Passover. 
JHN.13.2	While the 
JHN.13.3	 knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. 
JHN.13.4	So He gets up from the meal and lays aside His outer garment; and taking a towel, He wrapped it around His waist. 
JHN.13.5	Then He pours water into a basin. He began to wash the disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel wrapped around Him. 
JHN.13.6	Then He comes to Simon Peter, who says to Him, “Master, are You going to wash my feet?” 
JHN.13.7	 responded, “You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.” 
JHN.13.8	Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said to Him, “Master, then not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” 
JHN.13.10	 said to him, “He who has bathed has no need to wash, except the feet; he is completely clean. And you all are clean, though not every one.” 
JHN.13.11	He knew who was betraying Him; for this reason, He said, “Not all of you are clean.” 
JHN.13.12	So after He had washed their feet and put His robe back on and reclined again, He said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you? 
JHN.13.13	You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Master’—and rightly you say, for I am. 
JHN.13.14	So if I, your Master and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash each other’s feet. 
JHN.13.15	I have given you an example—you should do for each other what I have done for you. 
JHN.13.16	“Amen, 
JHN.13.17	If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them!”
JHN.13.18	“I am not speaking to all of you—I know whom I have chosen. But so the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’ 
JHN.13.19	From now on I am telling you, before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I am. 
JHN.13.20	Amen, 
JHN.13.21	After He said these things, 
JHN.13.22	The disciples began looking at each other, perplexed—who was He talking about? 
JHN.13.23	One of His disciples, whom 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter nods to him and says, “Ask Him—who is He talking about?” 
JHN.13.25	Then he who leaned on 
JHN.13.26	 answers, “It’s the one I will give this bit of 
JHN.13.27	And with that bit, satan entered into him. Then 
JHN.13.28	But no one reclining at the table knew why 
JHN.13.29	Since Judah had the moneybox, some thought 
JHN.13.30	So after Judah received the bit of 
JHN.13.31	Then when Judah had gone out, 
JHN.13.32	If God is glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him at once. 
JHN.13.33	Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will search for Me; and just as I told the Judean leaders, so I say to you now, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’ 
JHN.13.34	“I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, so also you must love one another. 
JHN.13.35	By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” 
JHN.13.36	“Master, where are You going?” Simon Peter said to Him. 
JHN.13.37	Peter said to Him, “Master, why can’t I follow You now? I’ll lay down my life for You!” 
JHN.13.38	 answers, “Will you lay down your life for Me? Amen, 
JHN.14.1	“Do not let your heart be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in Me. 
JHN.14.2	In My Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? 
JHN.14.3	If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to Myself, so that where I am you may also be. 
JHN.14.4	And you know the way to where I am going.” 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to Him, “Master, we don’t know where You are going. How can we know the way?” 
JHN.14.6	 said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life! No one comes to the Father except through Me. 
JHN.14.7	If you have come to know Me, you will know My Father also. From now on, you do know Him and have seen Him.” 
JHN.14.8	Philip said to Him, “Master, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 
JHN.14.9	 said to him, “Have I been with you for so long a time, and you haven’t come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 
JHN.14.10	Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own; but the Father dwelling in Me does His works. 
JHN.14.11	Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me—or at least believe because of the works themselves. 
JHN.14.12	“Amen, 
JHN.14.13	And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
JHN.14.14	If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.”
JHN.14.15	“If you love Me, you will keep My commandments. 
JHN.14.16	I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper so He may be with you forever—
JHN.14.17	the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him. You know Him, because He abides with you and will be in you. 
JHN.14.18	I will not abandon you as orphans; I will come to you. 
JHN.14.19	In a little while, the world will no longer behold Me, but you will behold Me. Because I live, you also will live! 
JHN.14.20	“In that day, you will know that I am in My Father, you are in Me, and I am in you. 
JHN.14.21	He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me. He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.” 
JHN.14.22	Judah (not the one from Kriot) said to Him, “Master, what has happened, that You are about to reveal Yourself to us and not the world?” 
JHN.14.23	 answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him. 
JHN.14.24	He who does not love Me does not keep My words. And the word you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me. 
JHN.14.25	These things I have spoken to you while dwelling with you. 
JHN.14.26	But the Helper, the 
JHN.14.27	“
JHN.14.28	You’ve heard Me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. 
JHN.14.29	I have told you now before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe! 
JHN.14.30	“I will not talk with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has nothing on Me. 
JHN.14.31	But in order that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. “Get up, let’s go from here!”
JHN.15.1	“I am the true vine, and My Father is the gardener. 
JHN.15.2	Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He trims so that it may bear more fruit. 
JHN.15.3	You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 
JHN.15.4	Abide in Me, and I will abide in you. The branch cannot itself produce fruit, unless it abides on the vine. Likewise, you cannot produce fruit unless you abide in Me. 
JHN.15.5	“I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for apart from Me, you can do nothing. 
JHN.15.6	If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away like a branch and is dried up. Such branches are picked up and thrown into the fire and burned. 
JHN.15.7	“If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you. 
JHN.15.8	In this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be My disciples.” 
JHN.15.9	“Just as the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you. Abide in My love! 
JHN.15.10	If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love. 
JHN.15.11	These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and your joy may be full. 
JHN.15.12	“This is My commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you. 
JHN.15.13	No one has greater love than this: that he lay down his life for his friends. 
JHN.15.14	You are My friends if you do what I command you. 
JHN.15.15	“I am no longer calling you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. Now I have called you friends, because everything I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. 
JHN.15.16	“You did not choose Me, but I chose you. I selected you so that you would go and produce fruit, and your fruit would remain. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in My name. 
JHN.15.17	“These things I command you, so that you may love one another.”
JHN.15.18	“If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before you. 
JHN.15.19	If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. But you are not of the world, since I have chosen you out of the world; therefore the world hates you. 
JHN.15.20	“Remember the word I spoke to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also. 
JHN.15.21	“But all these things they will do to you for the sake of My name, because they do not know the One who sent Me. 
JHN.15.22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. 
JHN.15.23	“He who hates Me also hates My Father. 
JHN.15.24	If I had not done works among them that no one else did, they would have no sin. But now they have seen and have hated both Me and My Father. 
JHN.15.25	So is fulfilled the word written in their Scripture, ‘They hated Me for no reason.’ 
JHN.15.26	“When the Helper comes—whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—He will testify about Me. 
JHN.15.27	And you also testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.”
JHN.16.1	“I have spoken these things to you so that you may be kept from stumbling. 
JHN.16.2	They will throw you out of the synagogues. Yes, an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. 
JHN.16.3	They will do these things because they have never known the Father or Me. 
JHN.16.4	But I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.”
JHN.16.5	“But now I am going to the One who sent Me, and not one of you is asking Me, ‘Where are you going?’ 
JHN.16.6	Because I have spoken these things to you, grief has filled your heart. 
JHN.16.7	But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away! For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. 
JHN.16.8	“When He comes, He will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment: 
JHN.16.9	concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; 
JHN.16.10	concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me; 
JHN.16.11	and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. 
JHN.16.12	“I still have much more to tell you, but you cannot handle it just now. 
JHN.16.13	But when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on His own; but whatever He hears, He will tell you. And He will declare to you the things that are to come. 
JHN.16.14	He will glorify Me, because He will take from what is Mine and declare it to you. 
JHN.16.15	Everything that the Father has is Mine. For this reason I said the 
JHN.16.16	“A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again in a little while, you will see Me.” 
JHN.16.17	Then some of His disciples said to one another, “What does He mean by telling us, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again in a little while, you will see Me’? And, ‘Because I am going to the Father’?” 
JHN.16.18	They kept on saying, “What’s this He’s saying, ‘A little while’? We don’t know what He’s talking about!” 
JHN.16.19	 knew that they wanted to question Him, so He said to them, “Are you asking each other about this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again in a little while, you will see Me’? 
JHN.16.20	Amen, 
JHN.16.21	“When a woman is in labor, she has pain because her hour has come. But when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the joy that a human being has been born into the world. 
JHN.16.22	So also you have sorrow now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you! 
JHN.16.23	“In that day, you will ask Me nothing. Amen, 
JHN.16.24	Up to now, you have not asked for anything in My name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be full. 
JHN.16.25	“These things I have spoken to you in metaphors. An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in metaphors, but will tell you plainly about the Father. 
JHN.16.26	In that day, you will ask in My name—and I’m not telling you that I will ask the Father on your behalf. 
JHN.16.27	For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God. 
JHN.16.28	I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again I am leaving the world and going to the Father.” 
JHN.16.29	His disciples say, “See, now You’re speaking plainly and not in metaphors. 
JHN.16.30	Now we know that You know everything and have no need to be asked anything. By this we believe that You came forth from God.” 
JHN.16.31	 answered them, “Do you now believe? 
JHN.16.32	Look, the hour is coming—indeed has come—when you will be scattered, each to his own, and you will abandon Me. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 
JHN.16.33	These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have 
JHN.17.1	 spoke these things; then, lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, so the Son may glorify You. 
JHN.17.2	Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, so may He give eternal life to all those You have given Him. 
JHN.17.3	And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and 
JHN.17.4	I glorified You on earth by finishing the work that You have given Me to do. 
JHN.17.5	Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world came to be.”
JHN.17.6	“I have made Your name known to the men of this world that You gave Me. They were Yours; You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. 
JHN.17.7	Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You. 
JHN.17.8	The words, which You gave Me, I have given to them. They received them and truly understood that I came from You, and they believed that You sent Me. 
JHN.17.9	I ask on their behalf. Not on behalf of the world do I ask, but on behalf of those You have given Me, for they are Yours. 
JHN.17.10	All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them. 
JHN.17.11	I am no longer in the world; but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name that You have given Me, so that they may be one just as We are. 
JHN.17.12	While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name that You have given Me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. 
JHN.17.13	“But now I am coming to You. I say these words while I am still in the world, so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. 
JHN.17.14	I have given them Your word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world just as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.15	I am not asking that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the evil one. 
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.17	“Make them holy in the truth. Your word is truth. 
JHN.17.18	Just as You sent Me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 
JHN.17.19	And for their sakes I make Myself holy, so that they also may be made holy in truth.”
JHN.17.20	“I pray not on behalf of these only, but also for those who believe in Me through their message, 
JHN.17.21	that they all may be one. Just as You, Father, are in Me and I am in You, so also may they be one in Us, so the world may believe that You sent Me. 
JHN.17.22	The glory that You have given to Me I have given to them, that they may be one just as We are one—
JHN.17.23	I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me and loved them as You loved Me. 
JHN.17.24	“Father, I also want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory—the glory You gave Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. 
JHN.17.25	Righteous Father, the world did not know You, but I knew You; and these knew that You sent Me. 
JHN.17.26	I made your Name known to them, and will continue to make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.”
JHN.18.1	When 
JHN.18.2	Now Judah, who was betraying Him, also knew the place, because 
JHN.18.3	So Judah, having taken a band of soldiers and some officers from the ruling 
JHN.18.4	Then 
JHN.18.5	“
JHN.18.6	So when 
JHN.18.7	So again He asked them, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “
JHN.18.8	 answered, “I told you, I am! If you’re looking for Me, let these men go their way.” 
JHN.18.9	This was so the word would be fulfilled that He spoke: “I did not lose one of those You have given Me.” 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the 
JHN.18.11	So 
JHN.18.12	Then the band of soldiers, with the captain and the officers of the Judeans, seized 
JHN.18.13	They led Him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the 
JHN.18.14	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Judean leaders that it was better for one man to die on behalf of the people. 
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter was following 
JHN.18.16	But Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the 
JHN.18.17	The maidservant at the door says to Peter, “Aren’t you one of this Man’s disciples too?” He says, “No, I’m not.” 
JHN.18.18	The servants and officers were standing around a fire they had made, because it was cold and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself. 
JHN.18.19	The 
JHN.18.20	“I have spoken openly to the world,” 
JHN.18.21	Why question Me? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them. Look, they know what I said.” 
JHN.18.22	When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby gave 
JHN.18.23	 answered him, “If I have spoken wrongly, give evidence of the wrong; but if rightly, why hit Me?” 
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent Him, still tied up, to Caiaphas, the 
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter was standing outside and warming himself. So they said to him, “Aren’t you one of His disciples too?” He denied it and said, “No, I’m not!” 
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the 
JHN.18.27	Again Peter denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed. 
JHN.18.28	Then they led 
JHN.18.29	Therefore Pilate came out to them and said, “What charge do you bring against this man?” 
JHN.18.30	They answered, “If He weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have handed Him over to you.” 
JHN.18.31	Then Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves, and judge Him by your 
JHN.18.32	This happened so that the word 
JHN.18.33	So Pilate went back into the Praetorium, called for 
JHN.18.34	“Are you saying this on your own,” 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and ruling 
JHN.18.36	 answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I wouldn’t be handed over to the Judean leaders. But as it is, My kingdom is not from here.” 
JHN.18.37	So Pilate said to Him, “Are you a king, then?” 
JHN.18.38	Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” After he said this, he went out again to the Judean leaders. He said to them, “I find no case against Him. 
JHN.18.39	But it’s your custom that I release someone for you at Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.40	They shouted back, “Not this One, but 
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate took 
JHN.19.2	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe. 
JHN.19.3	They kept coming up to Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him over and over. 
JHN.19.4	Pilate came out again. He said to them, “Look, I’m bringing Him out to you, to let you know that I find no case against Him.” 
JHN.19.5	So 
JHN.19.6	When the ruling 
JHN.19.7	The Judean leaders answered him, “We have a law, and according to the 
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard this word, he became even more fearful. 
JHN.19.9	He went into the Praetorium again and said to 
JHN.19.10	So Pilate said to Him, “You aren’t speaking to me? Don’t You know that I have the authority to release You, and I have the authority to crucify You?” 
JHN.19.11	 answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it hadn’t been given to you from above. For this reason, the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.” 
JHN.19.12	Pilate tried to let Him go after this; but the Judean leaders cried out, saying, “If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar!” 
JHN.19.13	So when Pilate heard these words, he brought 
JHN.19.14	It was the Day of Preparation for Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Judean leaders, “Behold, your king!” 
JHN.19.15	They shouted back, “Take Him away! Take Him away! Execute Him!” Pilate said to them, “Should I execute your king?” The ruling 
JHN.19.16	Finally, Pilate handed 
JHN.19.17	Then they took 
JHN.19.18	There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side and 
JHN.19.19	Pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the execution stake. It was written, “YESHUA HA-NATZRATI, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
JHN.19.20	Many Judeans read this sign, because the place where 
JHN.19.21	The ruling 
JHN.19.22	“What I have written, I have written,” Pilate answered. 
JHN.19.23	So the soldiers, when they executed 
JHN.19.24	So they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be.” This was so the Scripture would be fulfilled, “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” So the soldiers did these things. 
JHN.19.25	Standing near the execution stake of 
JHN.19.26	 saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby. He tells His mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” 
JHN.19.27	Then He tells the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that very hour, the disciple took her into his own home. 
JHN.19.28	After this, when 
JHN.19.29	A jar full of sour wine was sitting there, so they put a sponge soaked with the sour wine on a hyssop branch and brought it to His mouth. 
JHN.19.30	When 
JHN.19.31	It was the Day of Preparation, and the next day was a festival Shabbat. So that the bodies should not remain on the execution stake during Shabbat, the Judean leaders asked Pilate to have the legs broken and to have the bodies taken away. 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then the other who had been executed with 
JHN.19.33	Now when they came to 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 
JHN.19.35	He who has seen it has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. 
JHN.19.36	These things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, “Not a bone of His shall be broken.” 
JHN.19.37	And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.” 
JHN.19.38	After these things, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take 
JHN.19.39	Nicodemus, who had first visited 
JHN.19.40	Then they took the body of 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where He was executed, there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried. 
JHN.19.42	Because it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid 
JHN.20.1	Early in the morning on the first day of the week, while it is still dark, Miriam from Magdala comes to the tomb. She sees that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb. 
JHN.20.2	So she comes running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one 
JHN.20.3	Then Peter and the other disciple set out, going to the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	Leaning in, he sees the linen strips lying there. But he didn’t go in. 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter comes following him, and he entered the tomb. He looks upon the linen strips lying there, 
JHN.20.7	and the face cloth that had been on His head. It was not lying with the linen strips, but was rolled up in a place by itself. 
JHN.20.8	So then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also entered. He saw and believed. 
JHN.20.9	For they did not yet understand from Scripture that 
JHN.20.10	So the disciples went back to their own homes.
JHN.20.11	But Miriam stood outside the tomb weeping. As she was weeping, she bent down to look into the tomb. 
JHN.20.12	She sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where 
JHN.20.13	“Woman, why are you crying?” they say to her. She says to them, “Because they took away my Master, and I don’t know where they’ve put Him.” 
JHN.20.14	After she said these things, she turned around. And she sees 
JHN.20.15	 says to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Thinking He’s the gardener, she says to Him, “Sir, if You’ve carried Him away, tell me where You’ve put Him, and I will take Him away.” 
JHN.20.16	 says to her, “Miriam!” Turning around, she says to Him in Aramaic, “
JHN.20.17	 says to her, “Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet gone up to the Father. Go to My brothers and tell them, ‘I am going up to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’” 
JHN.20.18	Miriam from Magdala comes, announcing to the disciples, “I’ve seen the Lord,” and what He had said to her.
JHN.20.19	It was evening on that day, the first of the week. When the doors were locked where the disciples were, for fear of the Judean leaders, 
JHN.20.20	After He said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 
JHN.20.21	 said to them again, “
JHN.20.22	And after He said this, He breathed on them. And He said to them, “Receive the 
JHN.20.23	If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; but if you hold back, they are held back.” 
JHN.20.24	One of the Twelve, Thomas called the Twin, was not with them when 
JHN.20.25	The other disciples were saying to him, “We’ve seen the Lord!” But he replied to them, “Unless I see the nail prints in His hands, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand in His side, I will never believe!” 
JHN.20.26	Eight days later the disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. 
JHN.20.27	Then He said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe!” 
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” 
JHN.20.29	 said to Him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed? Blessed are the ones who have not seen and yet have believed!” 
JHN.20.30	 performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book. 
JHN.20.31	But these things have been written so that you may believe that 
JHN.21.1	After these things, 
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in the Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of the other disciples were together. 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.” “We’re coming with you too,” they said. They went out and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing. 
JHN.21.4	At dawn, 
JHN.21.5	So 
JHN.21.6	He said to them, “Throw the net off the right side of the boat, and you’ll find some.” So they threw the net, and they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish. 
JHN.21.7	Therefore the disciple whom 
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the boat from about two hundred cubits offshore, dragging the net full of fish. 
JHN.21.9	So when they got out onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire with fish placed on it, and bread. 
JHN.21.10	 said to them, “Bring some of the fish you’ve just caught.” 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to shore. There were 153 fish, many of them big; but the net was not broken. 
JHN.21.12	 said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?”—knowing it was the Lord.
JHN.21.13	 comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and likewise the fish. 
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time that 
JHN.21.15	When they had finished breakfast, 
JHN.21.16	He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” “Yes, Lord,” he said, “You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Take care of My sheep!” 
JHN.21.17	He said to him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was grieved because He said to him for a third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know everything! You know that I love You!” 
JHN.21.18	“Amen, 
JHN.21.19	Now this He said to indicate by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God. And after this, 
JHN.21.20	Peter, turning around, sees the disciple following. This was the one whom 
JHN.21.21	Seeing him, Peter said to 
JHN.21.22	 said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!” 
JHN.21.23	Therefore this saying went out among the brothers and sisters, that this disciple would not die. Yet 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who is an eyewitness of these things and wrote these things. We know that his testimony is true. 
JHN.21.25	There are also many other things that 
ACT.1.1	I wrote the first volume, Theophilus, about all that 
ACT.1.2	up to the day He was taken up, after He had given orders by the 
ACT.1.3	To them He showed Himself to be alive after His suffering through many convincing proofs, appearing to them for forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.1.4	Now while staying with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father promised—which, He said, “you heard from Me. 
ACT.1.5	For John immersed with water, but you will be immersed in the 
ACT.1.6	So when they gathered together, they asked Him, “Lord, are You restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” 
ACT.1.7	He said to them, “It is not your place to know the times or seasons which the Father has placed under His own control. 
ACT.1.8	But you will receive power when the 
ACT.1.9	After saying all this—while they were watching—He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	While they were staring into heaven as He went up, suddenly two men stood with them in white clothing. 
ACT.1.11	They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you keep standing here staring into heaven? This 
ACT.1.12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives (which is near Jerusalem, a 
ACT.1.13	When they had entered, they went up to the upper room where they were staying—Peter and John and Jacob and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; Jacob son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judah son of Jacob. 
ACT.1.14	All these with one mind were continuing together in prayer—along with the women and Miriam, 
ACT.1.15	In those days, Peter stood up among the brothers and sisters (the number of names all together was about a hundred and twenty) and said, 
ACT.1.16	“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the 
ACT.1.17	For he was counted among us and received his share of this office.” 
ACT.1.18	(Now this man Judah bought a field with the reward of his wickedness. Falling headfirst, he burst open in the middle and his intestines splattered out. 
ACT.1.19	And it became known to all those living in Jerusalem, so in their own language that field was called Akeldama—that is, ‘Field of Blood.’) 
ACT.1.20	For it is written in the Book of Psalms, ‘Let his dwelling place become desolate, and let there be no one living in it’ and ‘Let another take his position.’ 
ACT.1.21	“Therefore one of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord 
ACT.1.22	beginning with His immersion by John until the day He was taken up from us—must become a witness with us of His resurrection.” 
ACT.1.23	So they nominated two—Joseph, called Barsabbas (also called Justus), and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed and said, “You, O Lord, who knows the hearts of all men, show us which of these two You have chosen 
ACT.1.25	to take the position in this office as emissary, from which Judah turned aside to go to his own place.” 
ACT.1.26	Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was added to the eleven emissaries.
ACT.2.1	When the day of 
ACT.2.2	Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	And tongues like fire spreading out appeared to them and settled on each one of them. 
ACT.2.4	They were all filled with the 
ACT.2.5	Now Jewish people were staying in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	And when this sound came, the crowd gathered. They were bewildered, because each was hearing them speaking in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	And they were amazed and astonished, saying, “All these who are speaking—aren’t they Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	How is it that we each hear our own birth language? 
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those living in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and parts of Libya toward Cyrene, and visitors from Rome 
ACT.2.11	(both Jewish people and proselytes), Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring in our own tongues the mighty deeds of God!” 
ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to each other, “What does this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	Others, poking fun, were saying, “They are full of sweet new wine!” 
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: “Fellow Judeans and all who are staying in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words. 
ACT.2.15	These men are not drunk, as you suppose—for it’s only the third hour of the day! 
ACT.2.16	But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel: 
ACT.2.17	‘And it shall be in the last days,’ says God, ‘that I will pour out My 
ACT.2.18	Even on My slaves, male and female, I will pour out My 
ACT.2.19	And I will give wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath— blood, and fire, and smoky vapor. 
ACT.2.20	The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious Day of 
ACT.2.21	And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of 
ACT.2.22	“Men of Israel, hear these words! 
ACT.2.23	this 
ACT.2.24	But God raised Him up, releasing Him from the pains of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held by it. 
ACT.2.25	For David says about Him, ‘I saw 
ACT.2.26	Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced; moreover, my body also will live in hope, 
ACT.2.27	because You will not abandon my soul to 
ACT.2.28	You have made known to me the paths of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence.’ 
ACT.2.29	“Brothers, I can confidently tell you that the patriarch David died and was buried—his tomb is with us to this day. 
ACT.2.30	So because he was a prophet and knew God had sworn with an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne, 
ACT.2.31	David saw beforehand and spoke of Messiah’s resurrection—that He was not abandoned to 
ACT.2.32	“This 
ACT.2.33	Therefore, being exalted to the right hand of God and receiving from the Father the promise of the 
ACT.2.34	For David did not ascend into the heavens; yet he himself says, ‘
ACT.2.35	until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’ 
ACT.2.36	“Therefore let the whole house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him—this 
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the emissaries, “Fellow brethren, what shall we do?” 
ACT.2.38	Peter said to them, “Repent, and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah 
ACT.2.39	For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far away—as many as 
ACT.2.40	With many other words he warned them and kept urging them, saying, “Save yourselves from this twisted generation!” 
ACT.2.41	So those who received his message were immersed, and that day about three thousand souls were added. 
ACT.2.42	They were devoting themselves to the teaching of the emissaries and to fellowship, to breaking bread and to prayers. 
ACT.2.43	Fear lay upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were happening through the emissaries. 
ACT.2.44	And all who believed were together, having everything in common. 
ACT.2.45	They began selling their property and possessions and sharing them with all, as any had need. 
ACT.2.46	Day by day they continued with one mind, spending time at the Temple and breaking bread from house to house. They were sharing meals with gladness and sincerity of heart, 
ACT.2.47	praising God and having favor with all the people. And every day the Lord was adding to their number those being saved. 
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour, the time of prayer. 
ACT.3.2	A man lame from birth was being carried—every day they used to put him at the Temple gate called Beautiful, so he could beg for 
ACT.3.3	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the Temple, he began asking to receive 
ACT.3.4	But Peter, along with John, looked straight at him and said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give to you—in the name of 
ACT.3.7	Then grabbing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately the man’s feet and ankles were made strong. 
ACT.3.8	Jumping up, he stood and began walking; and he went with them into the Temple, walking and leaping and praising God! 
ACT.3.9	Now all the people saw him walking and praising God. 
ACT.3.10	They began to realize he was the one who used to sit begging for 
ACT.3.11	While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people together came running toward them in the place called Solomon’s Portico. 
ACT.3.12	But when Peter saw, he responded to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why do you stare at us—as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Servant 
ACT.3.14	But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you. 
ACT.3.15	You killed the Author of life—the One God raised from the dead! We are witnesses of it. 
ACT.3.16	Now through faith in the name of 
ACT.3.17	“Now brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your leaders did. 
ACT.3.18	But what God foretold through the mouth of all His prophets—that His Messiah was to suffer—so He has fulfilled. 
ACT.3.19	Repent, therefore, and return—so your sins might be blotted out, 
ACT.3.20	so times of relief might come from the presence of 
ACT.3.21	Heaven must receive Him, until the time of the restoration of all the things that God spoke about long ago through the mouth of His holy prophets. 
ACT.3.22	Moses said, ‘
ACT.3.23	And it shall be that every soul that will not listen to that Prophet shall be completely cut off from the people.’ 
ACT.3.24	Indeed, all the prophets who have spoken from Samuel on have announced these days. 
ACT.3.25	You are the sons of the prophets and also of the covenant that God cut with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 
ACT.3.26	God raised up His Servant and sent Him first to you, to bless you all by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”
ACT.4.1	As Peter and John were speaking to the people, the 
ACT.4.2	They were indignant because Peter and John were teaching the people and announcing in 
ACT.4.3	So they grabbed them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening. 
ACT.4.4	But many who heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand. 
ACT.4.5	On the next day, the rulers and elders and 
ACT.4.6	Annas the 
ACT.4.7	When they had placed Peter and John in their midst, they began to inquire, “By what power or in what name did you do this?” 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the 
ACT.4.9	If we are on trial today for a 
ACT.4.10	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of 
ACT.4.11	This 
ACT.4.12	There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved!” 
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and figured out they were laymen without training, they were amazed. They began to realize that these men had been with 
ACT.4.14	But seeing the healed man standing with them, they had nothing to say in response. 
ACT.4.15	When they had ordered Peter and John to go out of the council chamber, they began to confer with one another, 
ACT.4.16	saying, “What shall we do with these men? For indeed, it’s obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem that a remarkable miracle has happened through them, and we cannot deny it. 
ACT.4.17	But so it won’t spread any further among the people, let’s warn them not to speak anymore to anyone in this name.” 
ACT.4.18	So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you decide. 
ACT.4.20	For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.” 
ACT.4.21	After threatening them again, they let them go—finding no way they could punish them on account of the people, because they all were glorifying God for what had happened. 
ACT.4.22	For the man in whom this miracle of healing had happened was more than forty years old. 
ACT.4.23	As soon as they were released, Peter and John went to their own people and reported all that the ruling 
ACT.4.24	When they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, “O Sovereign Master, ‘You made heaven and earth and the sea, and everything in them.’ 
ACT.4.25	You said by the 
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered together against 
ACT.4.27	“For truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together in this city against Your holy Servant 
ACT.4.28	They did whatever Your hand and Your purpose predetermined to happen. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant Your servants to speak Your word with utmost courage— 
ACT.4.30	while You stretch out Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy Servant 
ACT.4.31	When they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken. And they were all filled with the 
ACT.4.32	Now the whole group of those who believed was one in heart and mind. No one would say anything he owned was his own, but they had everything in common. 
ACT.4.33	With great power the emissaries were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord 
ACT.4.34	No one among them was needy, for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds 
ACT.4.35	and set them at the feet of the emissaries. And the proceeds were distributed according to the need each one had. 
ACT.4.36	Now Joseph, also called Barnabas by the emissaries (which is translated Son of Encouragement), was a Levite and native of Cyprus. 
ACT.4.37	He sold a field that he owned and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the emissaries.
ACT.5.1	On the other hand, a man named Ananias together with his wife, Sapphira, sold a property. 
ACT.5.2	He kept back some of the proceeds, with his wife’s full knowledge, and brought part of it and set it at the feet of the emissaries. 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, “Ananias, why has satan filled your heart to lie to the 
ACT.5.4	While it remained unsold, it was your own, wasn’t it? And after it was sold, wasn’t it at your disposal? How did this deed get into your heart? You haven’t lied to men but to God.” 
ACT.5.5	As soon as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and died. Great fear came upon all who heard about it. 
ACT.5.6	The young men got up and wrapped him in a shroud, then carried him out and buried him. 
ACT.5.7	After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	Peter responded to her, “Tell me if you sold the land for this much.” She said, “Yes, for that much.” 
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said to her, “How did you agree to test the 
ACT.5.10	Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came back in, they found her dead and carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	And great fear came over the whole community and all who heard these things.
ACT.5.12	Meanwhile, through the hands of the emissaries many signs and wonders were happening among the people. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico. 
ACT.5.13	But no one else dared to join them, though the people continued to think highly of them. 
ACT.5.14	Yet more than ever those trusting in the Lord were added—large numbers of men and women. 
ACT.5.15	They even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on stretchers and cots, so that when Peter passed by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. 
ACT.5.16	Crowds were also gathering from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing those who were sick or tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all being healed. 
ACT.5.17	But the 
ACT.5.18	They grabbed the emissaries and put them in a public jail. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night an angel of 
ACT.5.20	“Go, stand in the Temple and speak to the people the whole message about this Life.” 
ACT.5.21	Now when they heard that, they entered the Temple at daybreak and began teaching. When the 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison. So they returned and reported, 
ACT.5.23	saying, “We found the prison locked with maximum security and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened up, we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	When the captain of the Temple and the ruling 
ACT.5.25	But someone came and reported to them, “The men you put in prison are standing in the Temple and teaching the people!” 
ACT.5.26	Then the captain went off with the officers and brought the emissaries—but not with force, because they feared they might be stoned by the people. 
ACT.5.27	When they had brought them, they placed them before the Sanhedrin. The 
ACT.5.28	saying, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name—and look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring on us the blood of this Man!” 
ACT.5.29	Peter and the emissaries replied, “We must obey God rather than men. 
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up 
ACT.5.31	This One God exalted at His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and removal of sins. 
ACT.5.32	And we are witnesses of these events—as is the 
ACT.5.33	Now when they heard this, they became enraged and wanted to kill them. 
ACT.5.34	But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the 
ACT.5.35	Then he said to them, “Men of Israel, be careful what you are about to do with these men. 
ACT.5.36	For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody; and a number of men, maybe four hundred, joined up with him. He was killed, and all who followed him were scattered and came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After this fellow, Judah the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and got people to follow him. He also perished, and all who followed him were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	So now I tell you, stay away from these men and leave them alone. For if this plan or undertaking is of men, it will come to an end; 
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, you will not be able to stop them. You might even be found fighting against God.” They took his advice, 
ACT.5.40	called in the emissaries, flogged them, ordered them not to continue speaking in the name of 
ACT.5.41	So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were considered worthy to be dishonored on account of His name. 
ACT.5.42	And every day, in the Temple and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming 
ACT.6.1	Now in those days, when the disciples were multiplying, grumbling arose among the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily support. 
ACT.6.2	So the Twelve called together the whole group of the disciples and said, “It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables. 
ACT.6.3	So, brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this duty. 
ACT.6.4	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the service of the Word.” 
ACT.6.5	The statement pleased the whole group; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the 
ACT.6.6	They placed these men before the emissaries; and after praying, they laid hands on them. 
ACT.6.7	The word of God kept on spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem greatly multiplied; even a great number of the 
ACT.6.8	Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen—both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, as well as some from Cilicia and Asia—stood up and began arguing with Stephen. 
ACT.6.10	But they could not withstand the wisdom and the 
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly instigated men into saying, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God!” 
ACT.6.12	They also incited the people, the elders, and the 
ACT.6.13	They set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking words against this holy place and the 
ACT.6.14	For we have heard him saying that this 
ACT.6.15	Watching him intently, everyone who was sitting in the Sanhedrin saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then the 
ACT.7.2	Stephen declared, “Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. 
ACT.7.3	He said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come here to the land that I will show you.’ 
ACT.7.4	Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God moved him to this land where you now live. 
ACT.7.5	He gave him no inheritance in it—not even a foothold—yet He promised ‘to give it to him as a possession to him and to his descendants after him,’ even though he had no child. 
ACT.7.6	“But God spoke in this way, that his ‘descendants would be foreigners in a land belonging to others, and they would enslave and mistreat them for four hundred years. 
ACT.7.7	But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they shall come out and serve Me in this place.’ 
ACT.7.8	“Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. So he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and so Isaac with Jacob, and Jacob with the twelve patriarchs. 
ACT.7.9	The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him. 
ACT.7.10	He rescued him out of all his troubles and granted him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and all his household. 
ACT.7.11	“Famine and great suffering came over all Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers could find no food. 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time. 
ACT.7.13	On the second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh. 
ACT.7.14	So Joseph sent and called for Jacob and all his relatives—seventy-five persons. 
ACT.7.15	Jacob went down to Egypt and died, he and our fathers. 
ACT.7.16	They were carried to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. 
ACT.7.17	“But as the time drew near for the promise God had sworn to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt—
ACT.7.18	until ‘there arose another king over Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph.’ 
ACT.7.19	Dealing with our people with cruel cunning, this king mistreated our fathers and forced them to abandon their infants so they would not survive. 
ACT.7.20	“At this time Moses was born—extraordinary before God. For three months he was nurtured in his father’s house. 
ACT.7.21	And when he was set outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and raised him as her own son. 
ACT.7.22	Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds. 
ACT.7.23	“When he was approaching forty years of age, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, 
ACT.7.24	When he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he went to the defense of the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	He was assuming that his brothers understood that by his hand God was delivering them, but they did not understand. 
ACT.7.26	So on the next day he appeared to them as they were fighting. He tried to reconcile them in 
ACT.7.27	“But the one doing wrong to his neighbor pushed him away, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? 
ACT.7.28	You don’t want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’ 
ACT.7.29	At this remark, Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. 
ACT.7.30	“When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in the flame of a burning bush. 
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. But when he came up to look, there came the voice of 
ACT.7.32	‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.’ “Moses trembled in fear and did not dare to look. 
ACT.7.33	But 
ACT.7.34	I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. Now come—let Me send you to Egypt.’ 
ACT.7.35	“This Moses—whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who appointed you as ruler and judge?’—is the one whom God sent as both ruler and redeemer, by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 
ACT.7.36	This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. 
ACT.7.37	This is the Moses who said to 
ACT.7.38	“This is the one who was in the community in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living words to pass on to us. 
ACT.7.39	Our fathers did not want to be obedient to him, but shoved him aside. And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt, 
ACT.7.40	saying to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us who will go before us. For this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we have no idea what has happened to him.’ 
ACT.7.41	“And they made a calf in those days, offered a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. 
ACT.7.42	But God turned and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the Prophets: ‘It was not to Me that you brought sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness, was it, O House of Israel? 
ACT.7.43	You also took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images you made to worship. And I will deport you beyond Babylon.’ 
ACT.7.44	“Our fathers had the Tent of Witness in the wilderness—just as the One speaking to Moses had directed him to make it according to the design he had seen. 
ACT.7.45	Our fathers received it in turn and brought it in with Joshua when they took possession of the land of the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it remained until the days of David, 
ACT.7.46	who found favor in God’s sight. He asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. 
ACT.7.47	But Solomon built a house for Him. 
ACT.7.48	However, Elyon does not dwell in man-made houses. As the prophet says, 
ACT.7.49	‘Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me, says 
ACT.7.50	Did not My Hand make all these things?’ 
ACT.7.51	“O you stiff-necked people! You uncircumcised of heart and ears! You always resist the 
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed the ones who foretold the coming of the Righteous One. Now you have become His betrayers and murderers—
ACT.7.53	you who received the 
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they became enraged and began gnashing their teeth at him. 
ACT.7.55	But Stephen, full of the 
ACT.7.56	And he said, “Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” 
ACT.7.57	But they covered their ears; and crying out with a loud voice, they rushed at him with one impulse. 
ACT.7.58	Driving him out of the city, they began stoning him, and the witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. 
ACT.7.59	They went on stoning Stephen as he was calling out, “Lord 
ACT.7.60	Then he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” After he said this, he died.
ACT.8.1	Now Saul was in agreement with Stephen’s execution. On that day a great persecution arose against Messiah’s community in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria, except the emissaries. 
ACT.8.2	Some devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul was destroying Messiah’s community, entering house after house; and dragging off men and women, he was throwing them into prison.
ACT.8.4	Now those who had been scattered went around proclaiming the Word. 
ACT.8.5	Philip went down to the main city of Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them. 
ACT.8.6	The crowds were paying close attention to what Philip was saying—as they both heard and saw the signs that he was doing. 
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits were coming out of many who were plagued, shrieking with a loud voice. Many paralyzed and crippled were healed also. 
ACT.8.8	So there was great joy in that city. 
ACT.8.9	Now a man named Simon had been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying he was someone great. 
ACT.8.10	They all were paying special attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called ‘Great.’” 
ACT.8.11	And they kept paying attention to him, because for a long time he had astonished them with his magical arts. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip proclaiming the Good News about the kingdom of God and the name of Messiah 
ACT.8.13	Even Simon himself believed; and after being immersed, he continued with Philip. And when he saw signs and great miracles happening, he was continually amazed. 
ACT.8.14	Now when the emissaries in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the message of God, they sent Peter and John to them. 
ACT.8.15	They came down and prayed for them to receive the 
ACT.8.16	For He had not yet come upon them; they had only been immersed in the name of the Lord 
ACT.8.17	Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the 
ACT.8.18	Now when Simon saw that the 
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give this power to me, too—so that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the 
ACT.8.20	Peter said to him, “May your silver go to ruin, and you with it—because you thought you could buy God’s gift with money! 
ACT.8.21	You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God. 
ACT.8.22	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be pardoned. 
ACT.8.23	For I see in you the poison of bitterness and the bondage of unrighteousness!” 
ACT.8.24	Simon replied, “Pray for me, so that none of what you have said may come upon me.” 
ACT.8.25	So when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, proclaiming the Good News to many Samaritan villages.
ACT.8.26	Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up, and go south on the road going down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.) 
ACT.8.27	So he got up and went. And behold, an Ethiopian eunuch—an official who was responsible for all the treasure of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians—had traveled to Jerusalem to worship 
ACT.8.28	and was now returning. Sitting in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
ACT.8.29	The 
ACT.8.30	Philip ran up and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 
ACT.8.31	“How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	Now the passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: “He was led as a sheep to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He opens not His Mouth. 
ACT.8.33	In His humiliation justice was denied Him. Who shall recount His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth.” 
ACT.8.34	The eunuch replied to Philip, “Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about—himself or someone else?” 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he proclaimed the Good News about 
ACT.8.36	Now as they were going down the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, “Look, water! What’s to prevent me from being immersed?” 
ACT.8.38	He ordered the chariot to stop. They both got down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and Philip immersed him. 
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the 
ACT.8.40	But Philip found himself at Azotus. And as he passed through, he kept proclaiming the Good News to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	Now Saul, still breathing out threats and murder against the Lord’s disciples, went to the 
ACT.9.2	He requested letters of introduction from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way, he might bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	As he was traveling, approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 
ACT.9.4	Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” 
ACT.9.5	“Who are You, Lord?” Saul said. “I am 
ACT.9.6	But get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” 
ACT.9.7	The men travelling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 
ACT.9.8	Saul got up from the ground—but opening his eyes, he could see nothing. They led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	For three days he could not see, and he did not eat or drink. 
ACT.9.10	Now there was a disciple named Ananias in Damascus. The Lord said to him, “Ananias.” He said, “Here I am, Lord.” 
ACT.9.11	The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street named Straight, and ask in the house of Judah for someone from Tarsus named Saul. For look, he is praying; 
ACT.9.12	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight.” 
ACT.9.13	But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man—how much harm he has done to your 
ACT.9.14	And here he has authority from the ruling 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a choice instrument to carry My name before nations and kings and 
ACT.9.16	For I will show him how much he must suffer for My name’s sake.” 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias left and entered into the house. Laying hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—
ACT.9.18	Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was immersed; 
ACT.9.19	and when he had taken food, he was strengthened. Now for several days, he was with the disciples in Damascus. 
ACT.9.20	Immediately he began proclaiming 
ACT.9.21	All those hearing him were amazed. They were saying, “Isn’t this the one who made havoc in Jerusalem for all those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to bring them as prisoners before the ruling 
ACT.9.22	But Saul kept growing stronger, and he was confounding the Jewish people living in Damascus by proving that 
ACT.9.23	When many days had passed, these Jewish people plotted to kill him— 
ACT.9.24	but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him. 
ACT.9.25	But the disciples took Saul by night and let him down over the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
ACT.9.26	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he made attempts to join up with the disciples—but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him in and brought him to the emissaries. He described to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and the Lord had spoken to him, and how he had spoken boldly in the name of 
ACT.9.28	So Saul was with them, going in and out in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	He was speaking and arguing with the Hellenists, but they were trying to kill him. 
ACT.9.30	When the brothers found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. 
ACT.9.31	So Messiah’s community throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had 
ACT.9.32	Peter went here and there among them all. He came down as well to the 
ACT.9.33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years—he was paralyzed. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Messiah 
ACT.9.35	All who lived in Lydda and the Plain of Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. 
ACT.9.36	In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translates as Dorcas). She was full of 
ACT.9.37	In those days, she became ill and died. When they had washed her for burial, they placed her in an upstairs room. 
ACT.9.38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples—hearing that Peter was there—sent two men to him, begging him, “Please come to us without delay!” 
ACT.9.39	So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room. All the widows were crying, showing all the tunics and other clothing Dorcas had made while she was with them. 
ACT.9.40	But Peter sent them all outside, and he got down on his knees and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	He gave her his hand and raised her up. Then he called the 
ACT.9.42	It became known throughout Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	So it happened that Peter stayed on in Joppa for several days with Simon, a tanner.
ACT.10.1	Now in Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort. 
ACT.10.2	He was a devout man, revering God with all his household. He gave 
ACT.10.3	About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming and saying to him, “Cornelius!” 
ACT.10.4	He stared at him in terror and said, “What is it, Lord?” The angel said to him, “Your prayers and 
ACT.10.5	Now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, also named Peter. 
ACT.10.6	He is being entertained as a guest by Simon the tanner, whose house is beside the sea.” 
ACT.10.7	When the angel speaking to him had left, he called two of his servants and a soldier from among those attached to his command. 
ACT.10.8	After he explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	The next day, as the soldiers were traveling and approaching the city, Peter went up to the rooftop to pray, at about the sixth hour. 
ACT.10.10	Now he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing something, he fell into a trance. 
ACT.10.11	He saw the heavens opened, and something like a great sheet coming down, lowered by its four corners to the earth. 
ACT.10.12	In it were all sorts of four-footed animals and reptiles and birds of the air. 
ACT.10.13	A voice came to him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.” 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord! For never have I eaten anything unholy or unclean.” 
ACT.10.15	Again a voice came to him, a second time: “What God has made clean, you must not consider unholy.” 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and the sheet was immediately taken up to heaven. 
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter was puzzling about what the vision he had seen might mean, behold, the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and appeared before the gate. 
ACT.10.18	They called out and began to ask whether Simon, also called Peter, was staying in this place as a guest. 
ACT.10.19	Now while Peter was mulling over the vision, the 
ACT.10.20	But get up, go downstairs, and go with them without hesitating, because I Myself have sent them.” 
ACT.10.21	Going down to the men, Peter said, “Here, I’m the one you’re looking for. What is the reason for your coming?” 
ACT.10.22	And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well-spoken of by all the Jewish people, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you.” 
ACT.10.23	So Peter invited them in to be his guests. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
ACT.10.24	The following day he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	As Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter pulled him up, saying, “Stand up! I too am just a man.” 
ACT.10.27	Talking with him, Peter went inside and found many people gathered. 
ACT.10.28	He said to them, “You yourselves know that it is not permitted for a Jewish man to associate with a non-Jew or to visit him. Yet God has shown me that I should call no one unholy or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	So I came without objection when I was sent for. I ask, then, what is the reason why you sent for me?” 
ACT.10.30	Cornelius declared, “Four days ago at this hour, I was praying minchah in my house. Suddenly, a man stood in front of me in shining clothes. 
ACT.10.31	He says, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your 
ACT.10.32	Therefore send to Joppa and ask for Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying in the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.” 
ACT.10.34	Then Peter opened his mouth and said, “I truly understand that God is not one to show favoritism, 
ACT.10.35	but in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him. 
ACT.10.36	You know the message He sent to 
ACT.10.37	You know the message that has spread throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the immersion that John proclaimed. 
ACT.10.38	You know how God anointed 
ACT.10.39	We are witnesses to all He did, both in the Judean countryside and in Jerusalem. They put Him to death by hanging Him on a tree, 
ACT.10.40	but God raised Him up on the third day and caused Him to be visible— 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but to us, witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God. We ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead. 
ACT.10.42	And He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that He is the One ordained by God as Judge of the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	All the prophets testify about Him—that everyone who puts his trust in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His name.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the 
ACT.10.45	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were astonished, because the gift of the 
ACT.10.46	For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered, 
ACT.10.47	“Can anyone refuse water for these to be immersed, who have received the 
ACT.10.48	So he commanded them to be immersed in the name of Messiah 
ACT.11.1	Now the emissaries and brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision took issue with him, 
ACT.11.3	saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!” 
ACT.11.4	So Peter began explaining to them point by point, saying, 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision—something like a great sheet coming down, being lowered from heaven by its four corners, and it came right to me. 
ACT.11.6	I looked inside, considering it carefully, and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the air. 
ACT.11.7	I also heard a voice saying, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’ 
ACT.11.8	“But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord! For never has anything unholy or unclean entered my mouth.’ 
ACT.11.9	But a voice from heaven answered a second time, ‘What God has made clean, you must not consider unholy.’ 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up to heaven. 
ACT.11.11	“At that very moment, three men arrived at the house where we were, sent to me from Caesarea. 
ACT.11.12	The 
ACT.11.13	He reported to us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter. 
ACT.11.14	He will speak words to you by which you will be saved—you and all your household.’ 
ACT.11.15	“As I began to speak, the 
ACT.11.16	And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, ‘John immersed with water, but you will be immersed in the 
ACT.11.17	Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us after we put our trust in the Lord Messiah 
ACT.11.18	When they heard this they became quiet, and they glorified God, saying, “Then even to the Gentiles God has granted repentance leading to life!” 
ACT.11.19	Now those scattered because of the persecution that happened in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Judeans. 
ACT.11.20	However, there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord 
ACT.11.21	The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. 
ACT.11.22	News about these things reached the ears of the community in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was thrilled. He encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with heartfelt devotion. 
ACT.11.24	For Barnabas was a good man, full of the 
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul, 
ACT.11.26	and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met together with Messiah’s community and taught a large number. Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christianoi.” 
ACT.11.27	Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them, named Agabus, stood up and predicted through the 
ACT.11.29	So the disciples decided to send relief to those brothers and sisters living in Judea, each according to his ability. 
ACT.11.30	This they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now at that time Herod the king seized some from Messiah’s community to do them harm. 
ACT.12.2	He had Jacob, John’s brother, put to death with the sword. 
ACT.12.3	Seeing it pleased the Judean leaders, he proceeded to capture Peter as well. This was during the Days of 
ACT.12.4	After seizing him, he put him in prison, handing him over to four squads with four soldiers each to guard him. He was intending to bring him before the people after Passover. 
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in prison, but prayer for him was being offered fervently to God by Messiah’s community. 
ACT.12.6	Now that very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping—bound with two chains between two soldiers, while guards before the gate were keeping watch over the prison. 
ACT.12.7	Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. He poked Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up! Quick!” And the chains fell off his hands. 
ACT.12.8	Then the angel said to him, “Get dressed and put on your sandals,” and he did so. Then he tells him, “Put on your cloak and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	Peter went out and kept following him—he didn’t know that what was happening with the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. 
ACT.12.10	After they passed a first guard and a second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them by itself. They went out and walked along a narrow street. Suddenly the angel left him. 
ACT.12.11	When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for real that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Judean people were expecting.” 
ACT.12.12	When he realized this, he went to the house of Miriam, the mother of John (also called Mark), where many were assembled together and praying. 
ACT.12.13	When he knocked on the door of the entrance gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	Although she recognized Peter’s voice, out of joy she did not open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. 
ACT.12.15	They said to her, “You’re crazy!” But she kept insisting it was so. But they were saying, “It is his angel.” 
ACT.12.16	But Peter kept on knocking. When they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed! 
ACT.12.17	But he motioned with his hand for them to be silent, and he explained to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, “Go tell these things to Jacob and the brothers.” Then he left and went to another place. 
ACT.12.18	When day came, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	After Herod made a search for him and did not find him, he interrogated the guards and commanded that they be led away to execution. Then he went down from Judea and stayed in Caesarea.
ACT.12.20	Now it happened that Herod was furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him, united. Having won over Blastus, the king’s personal aide, they began asking for peace—because their country was supplied with food from the king’s country. 
ACT.12.21	On an appointed day, Herod donned his royal robes and, taking his seat upon the throne, began to make a speech to them. 
ACT.12.22	The people were shouting, “The voice of a god and not a human!” 
ACT.12.23	Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down—because he did not give God the glory. And he was eaten by worms and died. 
ACT.12.24	But the word of God kept on growing and multiplying. 
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their service, taking along John (who was also called Mark).
ACT.13.1	Now in the Antioch community, there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen (brought up since childhood with Herod the Tetrarch), and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the 
ACT.13.3	Then after fasting, praying, and laying hands on them, they sent them off. 
ACT.13.4	So, sent out by the 
ACT.13.5	When they arrived at Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as a helper. 
ACT.13.6	When they had gone throughout the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a man who was a magician—a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-
ACT.13.7	He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	But Saul, who is also Paul, filled with the 
ACT.13.10	and said, “O you, full of all deceit and trickery, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness—will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? 
ACT.13.11	Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and not see the sun for awhile.” Immediately, cloudiness and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	When he saw what had happened, the proconsul believed, because he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Setting sail from Paphos, Paul’s company came to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them and returned to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	But they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia. Entering the synagogue on the Shabbat, they sat down. 
ACT.13.15	After the reading of the 
ACT.13.16	So Paul, standing up and motioning with his hand, said, “Men of Israel and God-fearers, listen. 
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an outstretched arm He led them out of there. 
ACT.13.18	For about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness. 
ACT.13.19	And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave their land as an inheritance—
ACT.13.20	all of this took about 450 years. After that, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 
ACT.13.21	Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	After removing him, He raised up David to be their king. He also testified about him and said, ‘I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do My will.’ 
ACT.13.23	“From this man’s seed, in keeping with His promise, God brought to Israel a Savior—
ACT.13.24	Before His coming, John had proclaimed an immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	As John was completing his service, he said, ‘What do you suppose me to be? I am not He. But behold, One is coming after me, whose sandal I’m not worthy to untie.’ 
ACT.13.26	“Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham and those among you who are God-fearers, it is to us the message of this salvation has been sent. 
ACT.13.27	For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers—not recognizing Him or the sayings of the Prophets that are read every Shabbat—fulfilled these words by condemning Him. 
ACT.13.28	Though they found no charge worthy of a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed. 
ACT.13.29	When they had carried out all that had been written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised Him from the dead! 
ACT.13.31	For many days He appeared to those who had come up from the Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	“And we proclaim to you Good News—the promise to the fathers has arrived! 
ACT.13.33	For God has fulfilled this promise to the children—to us—by raising up 
ACT.13.34	“But since He raised Him up from the dead, never to return to decay, He has spoken in this way, ‘I will give you the holy and sure mercies of David.’ 
ACT.13.35	Therefore He also says in another psalm, ‘You will not permit Your Holy One to see decay.’ 
ACT.13.36	For after David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he went to sleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay. 
ACT.13.37	But the One whom God raised up did not see decay. 
ACT.13.38	“Therefore, let it be known to you, brothers, that through this One is proclaimed to you the removal of sins, including all those from which you could not be set right by the 
ACT.13.39	Through this One everyone who keeps trusting is made righteous. 
ACT.13.40	“Be careful, then, so that what is said in the Prophets may not come upon you: 
ACT.13.41	‘Look, you scoffers, be amazed and vanish away. For I am doing a work in your days— a work you will never believe, even if someone tells it to you in detail.’” 
ACT.13.42	As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging them to speak these things to them the next Shabbat. 
ACT.13.43	When the synagogue meeting broke up, many of the Jewish people and God-fearing inquirers followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking with them and trying to persuade them to continue in the grace of God. 
ACT.13.44	The following Shabbat, almost the entire city came together to hear the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.45	When the Jewish leaders saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and tried to contradict what Paul was saying by reviling him. 
ACT.13.46	Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first. Since you reject it and judge yourselves unfit for eternal life—behold, we turn to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	For so the Lord has commanded us, ‘I have placed you as a light to the nations, so that you may bring salvation to the end of the earth.’” 
ACT.13.48	When the Gentiles heard this, they were thrilled and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as had been inscribed for eternal life believed. 
ACT.13.49	Now the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and they drove them out of their district. 
ACT.13.51	But Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet against them, and they went on to Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and the 
ACT.14.1	Now in Iconium, the same thing happened—they entered as usual into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large number of Jewish and Greek people believed. 
ACT.14.2	But the Jewish people who would not believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. 
ACT.14.3	So they stayed there a considerable time, speaking boldly in the Lord—who was testifying to the message of His grace, granting signs and wonders to come about by their hands. 
ACT.14.4	But the population of the city split; some were with the Jewish leaders and some were with the emissaries. 
ACT.14.5	Now it happened that an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jewish people, along with their rulers, to abuse and stone them. 
ACT.14.6	But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding countryside. 
ACT.14.7	There they proclaimed the Good News. 
ACT.14.8	Now a man was sitting in Lystra without strength in his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	This man heard Paul speaking. When Paul looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed, 
ACT.14.10	he said with a loud voice, “Stand right up! On your feet!” And the man leaped up and began to walk around! 
ACT.14.11	Now the crowd, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, “The gods have become like men and come down to us!” 
ACT.14.12	And they began calling Barnabas “Zeus” and Paul “Hermes” (because he was the main speaker). 
ACT.14.13	The priest of Zeus, whose temple was before the front gate of the city, brought bulls and garlands; he wanted to offer a sacrifice with the people. 
ACT.14.14	But when the emissaries Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out among the crowd, crying out 
ACT.14.15	and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We too are human, just like you! We proclaim the Good News to you, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. 
ACT.14.16	In past generations He allowed all the nations to go their own ways. 
ACT.14.17	Yet He did not leave Himself without a witness—He did good by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with joy and gladness.” 
ACT.14.18	Even saying these things, they barely restrained the crowd from sacrificing to them. 
ACT.14.19	But Jewish people came from Antioch and Iconium; and after they won the crowd over and stoned Paul, they were dragging him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. 
ACT.14.20	But while the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went back into the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	After proclaiming the Good News to that city and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch. 
ACT.14.22	They were strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to persevere in faith, and saying, “It is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of God.” 
ACT.14.23	When they had handpicked elders for them in every community, and prayed with fasting, they placed them in the care of the Lord—in whom they had put their trust. 
ACT.14.24	Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphyllia. 
ACT.14.25	After speaking the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	From there they sailed back to Antioch (where they had been entrusted to the gracious care of God for the work now completed). 
ACT.14.27	When they arrived and gathered together Messiah’s community, they began to report all that God had done in helping them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 
ACT.14.28	And they stayed quite awhile with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	Now some men coming down from Judea were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.15.2	When Paul and Barnabas had a big argument and debate with them, the brothers appointed Paul and Barnabas with some others from among them to go up to Jerusalem to the emissaries and elders about this issue. 
ACT.15.3	So they were sent on their way by the Antioch community. They were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and they were bringing great joy to all the brothers and sisters. 
ACT.15.4	When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the community and the emissaries and the elders. They reported all that God had done in helping them. 
ACT.15.5	But some belonging to the party of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the 
ACT.15.6	The emissaries and elders were gathered together to examine this issue. 
ACT.15.7	After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose from among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Good News and believe. 
ACT.15.8	And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving them the 
ACT.15.9	He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts through faith. 
ACT.15.10	Why then do you put God to the test by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples—which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 
ACT.15.11	But instead, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord 
ACT.15.12	Then the whole group became silent and were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were describing in detail all the signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. 
ACT.15.13	After they finished speaking, Jacob answered, “Brothers, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Simon has described how God first showed His concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for His Name. 
ACT.15.15	The words of the Prophets agree, as it is written: 
ACT.15.16	‘After this I will return and rebuild the fallen tabernacle of David. I will rebuild its ruins and I will restore it, 
ACT.15.17	so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord— namely all the Gentiles who are called by My name— says 
ACT.15.18	known from of old.’ 
ACT.15.19	Therefore, I judge not to trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God— 
ACT.15.20	but to write to them to abstain from the contamination of idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what is strangled, and from blood. 
ACT.15.21	For Moses from ancient generations has had in every city those who proclaim him, since he is read in all the synagogues every Shabbat.”
ACT.15.22	Then it seemed good to the emissaries and elders, with the whole community, to choose men from among themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judah (also called Barsabbas) and Silas, leading men among the brethren, 
ACT.15.23	and this letter along with them: “The emissaries and the elders, your brothers, To the Gentile brothers of Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings! 
ACT.15.24	Since we have heard that some from among us have troubled you with words disturbing to your souls, although we gave them no such authorization, 
ACT.15.25	it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul— 
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord 
ACT.15.27	We therefore have sent to you Judah and Silas, who themselves will report to you the same things by word of mouth. 
ACT.15.28	It seemed good to the 
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. By keeping away from these things, you will do well. 
ACT.15.30	So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and when they had gathered the whole group together, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	The people read it and rejoiced over its encouragement. 
ACT.15.32	Judah and Silas, prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers and sisters with a long message and strengthened them. 
ACT.15.33	After spending some time there, they were sent off with 
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord with many others.
ACT.15.36	After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return and visit the brothers and sisters in every city where we have proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are.” 
ACT.15.37	Barnabas was planning to take along John, called Mark. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul was insisting that they shouldn’t take him along—the one who had deserted them in Pamphylia, not accompanying them in the work. 
ACT.15.39	A sharp disagreement took place, so that they split off from one another. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	But Paul selected Silas and went out, being entrusted by the brothers and sisters to the gracious care of the Lord. 
ACT.15.41	He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the communities.
ACT.16.1	Now Paul came to Derbe and Lystra. There was a disciple there named Timothy, son of a woman who was a Jewish believer and a Greek father, 
ACT.16.2	who was well-spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted this man to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him for the sake of the Jewish people in those places—for they all knew that his father was Greek. 
ACT.16.4	As they were traveling through the cities, they were handing down the rulings that had been decided upon by the emissaries and elders in Jerusalem, for them to keep. 
ACT.16.5	So Messiah’s communities were strengthened in the faith and kept increasing daily in number.
ACT.16.6	They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the 
ACT.16.7	When they came to Mysia, they were trying to proceed into Bithynia, but the 
ACT.16.8	So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	Now a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man from Macedonia was standing and pleading with him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!” 
ACT.16.10	As soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we tried to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the Good News to them. 
ACT.16.11	So we put out to sea from Troas and made a straight course for Samothrace, the next day on to Neapolis, 
ACT.16.12	and from there to Philippi—which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia as well as a Roman colony. We stayed in this city for several days. 
ACT.16.13	On Yom Shabbat, we went outside the gate to the river, where we expected a place of prayer to be. We sat down and began speaking with the women who had gathered. 
ACT.16.14	A woman named Lydia—a seller of purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, a God-fearer—was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying. 
ACT.16.15	When she was immersed, along with her household, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my house.” And she insisted. 
ACT.16.16	It so happened that as we were going to prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination, who was bringing her masters much profit from her fortune-telling. 
ACT.16.17	Following after Paul and us, she kept shouting, saying, “These men are servants of 
ACT.16.18	She kept doing this for many days. But Paul was irritated and turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Messiah 
ACT.16.19	But when her masters saw that the hope of profit was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. 
ACT.16.20	And when they brought them to the chief authorities, they said, “These men are throwing our city into an uproar! Being Jewish, 
ACT.16.21	they advocate customs which are not permitted for us to accept or practice, being Romans.” 
ACT.16.22	Then the crowd joined in the attack on them. So the chief authorities ripped their clothes off them and commanded them to be beaten with rods. 
ACT.16.23	After inflicting many blows on them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to guard them securely. 
ACT.16.24	Having received this charge, he threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. 
ACT.16.25	But about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. 
ACT.16.26	Suddenly there was such a great earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were unlocked, and everyone’s chains came loose. 
ACT.16.27	When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners had escaped. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Don’t harm yourself! We’re all here!” 
ACT.16.29	The jailer called for lights and rushed in; and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	After he brought them out, he said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 
ACT.16.31	They said, “Put your trust in the Lord 
ACT.16.32	Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him, along with everyone in his household. 
ACT.16.33	He took them that very hour and washed their wounds, and at once he was immersed—he and all his household. 
ACT.16.34	The jailer brought them to his house and set food before them, and he was overjoyed that he with his entire household had put their trust in God. 
ACT.16.35	When day came, the chief authorities sent their police officers, saying, “Release those men.” 
ACT.16.36	But the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The chief authorities have sent orders to release you. So come out now, and go in 
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to the officers, “They have beaten us publicly without a trial—men who are Roman citizens—and have thrown us into prison. And now they are sending us away secretly? No! Let them come themselves and lead us out!” 
ACT.16.38	The police officers reported these words to the chief authorities. They became afraid when they heard they were Romans, 
ACT.16.39	so they came and apologized to them. After they escorted them out, they kept begging them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	When Paul and Silas went out of the prison, they visited Lydia’s house. And when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed. 
ACT.17.1	After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.2	As was his custom, Paul went to the Jewish people; and for three 
ACT.17.3	He opened them and gave evidence that Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead, saying, “This 
ACT.17.4	Some of them were convinced and became attached to Paul and Silas, as were a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and no small number of the leading women. 
ACT.17.5	But some of the Jewish people became jealous. Taking some wicked fellows of the marketplace and gathering a crowd, they stirred the city into an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, trying to bring Paul and Silas out to the mob. 
ACT.17.6	When they did not find them, they instead began dragging Jason and some of the brethren before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have upset the world have come here too, 
ACT.17.7	and Jason has welcomed them! They are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, 
ACT.17.8	Hearing these things, the crowd and the city officials were confused. 
ACT.17.9	But after receiving bail from Jason and the rest, they released them. 
ACT.17.10	As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas to Berea. Upon arrival, they made their way to the Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, because they received the message with goodwill, searching the Scriptures each day to see whether these things were true. 
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed, as well as quite a few prominent Greek women and men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jewish people of Thessalonica learned that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they came there too, agitating and inciting the people. 
ACT.17.14	Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. 
ACT.17.15	Those escorting Paul brought him as far as Athens. After receiving an order for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left. 
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was aroused within him when he saw that the city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he was debating in the synagogue with the Jewish people and the God-fearers, as well as in the marketplace every day with all who happened to be there. 
ACT.17.18	Also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, “What’s this babbler trying to say?” while others, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities”—because he was proclaiming the Good News of 
ACT.17.19	So they took Paul to the Aereopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are talking about? 
ACT.17.20	For you are bringing some strange things to our ears, so we want to know what these things mean.” 
ACT.17.21	Now all the Athenians and foreigners visiting there used to pass their time doing nothing but telling or hearing something new. 
ACT.17.22	So Paul stood in the middle of the Aereopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that in all ways you are very religious. 
ACT.17.23	For while I was passing through and observing the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an Unknown God.’ Therefore what you worship without knowing, this I proclaim to you. 
ACT.17.24	The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands. 
ACT.17.25	Nor is He served by human hands, as if He needed anything, since He Himself gives to everyone life and breath and all things. 
ACT.17.26	From one He made every nation of men to live on the face of the earth, having set appointed times and the boundaries of their territory. 
ACT.17.27	They were to search for Him, and perhaps grope around for Him and find Him. Yet He is not far from each one of us, 
ACT.17.28	for ‘In Him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His offspring.’ 
ACT.17.29	Since we are His offspring, we ought not to suppose the Deity is like gold or silver or stone, an engraved image of human art and imagination. 
ACT.17.30	Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance, now He commands everyone everywhere to repent. 
ACT.17.31	For He has set a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness, through a Man whom He has appointed. He has brought forth evidence of this to all men, by raising Him from the dead.” 
ACT.17.32	Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began scoffing. But others said, “We will hear from you again about this.” 
ACT.17.33	So Paul left from their midst. 
ACT.17.34	But some men joined with him and believed—among them Dionysius (a member of the council of the Aereopagus), a woman named Damaris, and others with them. 
ACT.18.1	After these things, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	There he found a Jewish man named Aquila—a native of Pontus having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all Jewish people to leave Rome. Paul went to see them; 
ACT.18.3	and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and began working, for by trade they were tent-makers. 
ACT.18.4	And he was debating every 
ACT.18.5	Now when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul became occupied with the message, urgently testifying to the Jewish people that 
ACT.18.6	But when they resisted and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said, “Your blood be upon your own heads—I am clean! From now on, I will go to the Gentiles.” 
ACT.18.7	After leaving there, Paul went into the house of a man named Titius Justus, a God-fearer whose house was next door to the synagogue. 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the synagogue leader, put his faith in the Lord, along with his whole household. And many of the Corinthians, upon hearing, were believing and being immersed. 
ACT.18.9	Now the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent! 
ACT.18.10	For I am with you and no one shall attack you to harm you—many people in this city are for Me.” 
ACT.18.11	So he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
ACT.18.12	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jewish leaders made a united attack against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat, 
ACT.18.13	saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the 
ACT.18.14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jewish people, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or a vicious crime, there would be a reason to put up with you, O Jews. 
ACT.18.15	But since it is issues about words, names, and your own law, see to it yourselves. I do not wish to be a judge of these.” 
ACT.18.16	And he drove them from the judgment seat. 
ACT.18.17	Then they all grabbed Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to these things.
ACT.18.18	Paul, having stayed many more days, said farewell to the brothers and set sail to Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchrea Paul had his hair cut off, for he was keeping a vow. 
ACT.18.19	When they arrived at Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila there. But he himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jewish people. 
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to stay longer, he declined, 
ACT.18.21	instead taking leave of them while saying, “God willing, I’ll return to you again.” He set sail from Ephesus. 
ACT.18.22	After landing at Caesarea, he went up and greeted Messiah’s community; then he went down to Antioch. 
ACT.18.23	After spending some time there, he departed and went one place after another throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. 
ACT.18.24	Now a Jewish man named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, well versed in the Scriptures. 
ACT.18.25	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. With a fervent spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the facts about 
ACT.18.26	This man began speaking out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God more accurately. 
ACT.18.27	When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. Upon arrival, he greatly helped those who by grace had believed. 
ACT.18.28	For he powerfully refuted the Jewish people in public, demonstrating through the Scriptures that the Messiah was 
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul traveled through the upper region and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples 
ACT.19.2	and said to them, “Did you receive the 
ACT.19.3	He said, “Into what were you immersed?” They said, “Into John’s immersion.” 
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John immersed with an immersion of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the One coming after him—that is, in 
ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul laid hands upon them, the 
ACT.19.7	In all, there were about twelve men.
ACT.19.8	Paul went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, debating and persuading them about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.19.9	But when they were hardening and refusing to believe, speaking evil of the Way before the whole group, he withdrew from them, taking the disciples with him, debating daily in the hall of Tyrannus. 
ACT.19.10	This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord—Jewish as well as Greek people. 
ACT.19.11	God was doing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands, 
ACT.19.12	so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that touched his skin were brought to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. 
ACT.19.13	But some traveling Jewish exorcists also tried to invoke the name of the Lord 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of a Jewish ruling 
ACT.19.15	But the evil spirit answered them, “I know 
ACT.19.16	Then the man with the evil spirit sprang at them, subduing and overpowering all of them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jewish and Greek people. Fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord 
ACT.19.18	Many also of those who had believed came confessing and recounting their practices. 
ACT.19.19	And many of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together in a heap, burning them before everyone. They totaled the value of the books and found it to be about fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
ACT.19.20	So the word of the Lord was growing in power and prevailing. 
ACT.19.21	Now after these things were accomplished, Paul resolved in the 
ACT.19.22	So after sending two who were assisting him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while. 
ACT.19.23	Around that time, there arose no small uproar concerning the Way. 
ACT.19.24	For a man named Demetrius—a silversmith, a maker of silver shrines of Artemis—was providing no small amount of business to the craftsmen. 
ACT.19.25	He gathered these together, along with those of related occupations, and he said, “Men, you know that our wealth is from this business. 
ACT.19.26	You see and hear that not only in Ephesus but also throughout all Asia, Paul has persuaded and perverted a considerable crowd, saying that handmade gods are not gods at all. 
ACT.19.27	Not only is there a danger that this trade of ours might come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis might be considered as nothing. She whom all Asia and the world worships might even be thrown down from her majesty.” 
ACT.19.28	When they heard, they were filled with fury and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.29	The city was filled with confusion. They rushed into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were travel companions of Paul. 
ACT.19.30	Paul was wishing to enter among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. 
ACT.19.31	Some of the chiefs of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to surrender himself in the theater. 
ACT.19.32	Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most did not know why they had come together. 
ACT.19.33	Some of the crowd solicited Alexander, whom the Jewish people put forward. Alexander motioned with his hand. He wished to offer a defense to the crowd. 
ACT.19.34	But recognizing that he was Jewish, for about two hours they all with one voice cried out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.35	After the town clerk quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn’t know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis and of her image fallen from heaven? 
ACT.19.36	Since these things are undeniable, you must be calm and do nothing reckless. 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor revilers of our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	If Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse them. 
ACT.19.39	But if you seek anything further, it will be settled in the lawful assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no reason which we are able to give to justify this mob.” Upon saying this, he dismissed the assembly. 
ACT.20.1	After the uproar ended, Paul sent for the disciples; and when he had encouraged them and said farewell, he departed to go to Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	When he had passed through these parts and given them a great word of encouragement, he came to Greece, 
ACT.20.3	where he spent three months. When a plot was formed against him by the Jewish leaders as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return via Macedonia. 
ACT.20.4	Sopater of Berea, son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; as well as Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica; Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia. 
ACT.20.5	These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	But we sailed from Philippi after the Days of 
ACT.20.7	Now on the first day of the week, we gathered to break bread. Paul was talking with them, intending to leave the next day, so he prolonged his speech till midnight. 
ACT.20.8	There were many lamps in the upper chamber where we were meeting. 
ACT.20.9	Now a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a windowsill, sinking into a deep sleep as Paul kept on talking. Overcome by sleep, he fell from the third story and was picked up—dead. 
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down, fell on him and threw his arms around him. He said, “Don’t be upset, for his life is within him.” 
ACT.20.11	After he went back up and broke the bread and ate, he talked with them a long while until daybreak and then left. 
ACT.20.12	So they took the boy away alive, greatly relieved.
ACT.20.13	But we went on ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there—for so he had arranged, intending himself to travel there by land. 
ACT.20.14	When he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	Sailing from there, we arrived the next day opposite Chios; the next day we crossed over to Samos, and the day after that we came to Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not spend much time in Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of 
ACT.20.17	From Miletus, dispatching someone to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the community. 
ACT.20.18	When they came to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know how I behaved among you all the time from the first day I set foot in Asia, 
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility and tears and trials which fell upon me through the plots of the Jewish leaders. 
ACT.20.20	I did not shrink back from proclaiming to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly as well as from house to house, 
ACT.20.21	testifying to both Jewish and Greek people repentance to God and trust in our Lord 
ACT.20.22	“And now, look, bound by the 
ACT.20.23	except that the 
ACT.20.24	However, I don’t consider my life of any value, except that I might finish my course and the office I received from the Lord 
ACT.20.25	“Now, look! I know that none of you, among whom I have gone proclaiming the kingdom, will ever see my face again. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all. 
ACT.20.27	For I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole purpose of God. 
ACT.20.28	“Take care of yourselves and all the flock of which the 
ACT.20.29	I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 
ACT.20.30	Even from among yourselves will arise men speaking perversions, to draw the disciples away after themselves. 
ACT.20.31	Therefore be alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning you with tears. 
ACT.20.32	“Now I commit you to God and the word of His grace, which is strong to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who have been made holy. 
ACT.20.33	I coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothing. 
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that these hands of mine have provided for my own needs as well as for those with me. 
ACT.20.35	In all things I have shown you an object lesson—that by hard work one must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord 
ACT.20.36	When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	They all began weeping and falling upon Paul’s neck and kissing him, 
ACT.20.38	grieving most of all over the statement he made that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship. 
ACT.21.1	After tearing ourselves away from them and setting sail, we set a straight course to Cos, the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 
ACT.21.2	Finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	When we came in sight of Cyprus, passing it by on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre—for there the ship was to unload the cargo. 
ACT.21.4	We looked up the disciples and stayed there seven days. They kept telling Paul through the 
ACT.21.5	When our days there were over, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. After kneeling down on the shore and praying, 
ACT.21.6	we said farewell to one another. Then we boarded the ship, and they returned home. 
ACT.21.7	When we had finished the trip from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for one day. 
ACT.21.8	On the next day, we departed and came to Caesarea. We entered the home of Philip, the proclaimer of Good News, who was one of the seven, and we stayed with him. 
ACT.21.9	Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied. 
ACT.21.10	While we stayed there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	He came to us, took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet, and said, “The 
ACT.21.12	When we heard these things, both we and the local people urged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul responded, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but to die for the name of the Lord 
ACT.21.14	Since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, saying only, “May the Lord’s will be done.” 
ACT.21.15	After these days, we packed and started going up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing us to Mnason of Cyprus—one of the early disciples by whom we might be hosted.
ACT.21.17	When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters welcomed us gladly. 
ACT.21.18	On the next day, Paul went in with us to Jacob; all the elders were present. 
ACT.21.19	After greeting them, he reported to them in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his service. 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard, they began glorifying God. They said, “You see, brother, how many myriads there are among the Jewish people who have believed—and they are all zealous for the 
ACT.21.21	They have been told about you—that you teach all the Jewish people among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs. 
ACT.21.22	What’s to be done then? No doubt they will hear that you have come. 
ACT.21.23	“So do what we tell you. We have four men who have a vow on themselves. 
ACT.21.24	Take them, and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. That way, all will realize there is nothing to the things they have been told about you, but that you yourself walk in an orderly manner, keeping the 
ACT.21.25	“As for Gentiles who have believed, however, we have written by letter what we decided—for them to abstain from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from immorality.” 
ACT.21.26	The next day Paul took the men, purifying himself along with them. He went into the Temple, announcing when the days of purification would be completed and the sacrifice would be offered for each one of them.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days were about to be completed, the Jewish leaders from Asia saw Paul in the Temple and began stirring up the whole crowd. They grabbed him, 
ACT.21.28	shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against our people and the 
ACT.21.29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the Temple. 
ACT.21.30	The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the Temple, and the gates were shut at once. 
ACT.21.31	As they were trying to kill him, news came to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in chaos. 
ACT.21.32	Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and rushed down to them. Upon seeing the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the commander came up, arrested Paul, ordered him to be bound with two chains, and began investigating what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	Some in the crowd shouted one thing, and some another. As he could not determine the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into headquarters. 
ACT.21.35	When he came to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd. 
ACT.21.36	For the multitude of people that followed kept shouting, “Away with him!” 
ACT.21.37	As Paul was about to be brought into the headquarters, he said to the commander, “Can I say something to you?” The commander said, “You know Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Then you’re not the Egyptian who stirred up a rebellion some time ago—and led four thousand men of the Assassins out into the desert?” 
ACT.21.39	Paul said, “I am a Jewish man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, let me speak to the people.” 
ACT.21.40	When the commander had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people with his hand. When there was a great hush, he spoke to them in Aramaic, saying:
ACT.22.1	“Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense which I now present to you.” 
ACT.22.2	When they heard that Paul was addressing them in Aramaic, they became even more quiet. Then he said, 
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jewish man, born in Tarsus of Cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, trained strictly according to the 
ACT.22.4	I persecuted this Way to the death, arresting both men and women and throwing them in prisons— 
ACT.22.5	as the 
ACT.22.6	“But it happened that as I was traveling and drawing near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly flashed all around me. 
ACT.22.7	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?’ 
ACT.22.8	“I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “He said to me, ‘I am 
ACT.22.9	“Now those who were with me saw the light, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me. 
ACT.22.10	So I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ “And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up, and go to Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’ 
ACT.22.11	“But since I could not see because of the brilliance of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus. 
ACT.22.12	Then a certain Ananias—a devout man according to the 
ACT.22.13	came to me. Standing before me, he said to me, ‘Brother Saul, look up!’ In that very moment, I looked and saw him! 
ACT.22.14	“And he said, ‘The God of our fathers handpicked you to know His will—to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth. 
ACT.22.15	For you will be a witness for Him to all people of what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	Now why are you waiting? Get up and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on His Name.’ 
ACT.22.17	“It happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance; 
ACT.22.18	and I saw Him saying to me, ‘Hurry! Get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your witness about Me.’ 
ACT.22.19	“And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another, I was imprisoning and beating those trusting in You. 
ACT.22.20	Even when the blood of Your witness Stephen was spilled, I too was standing by and approving, and guarding the clothing of those who were killing him.’ 
ACT.22.21	“And he said to me, ‘Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’” 
ACT.22.22	Up to this statement they listened to him. Then they raised their voices, saying, “Away from the earth with this fellow! For he’s not fit to live!” 
ACT.22.23	As they were crying out and flinging off their cloaks and throwing dust into the air, 
ACT.22.24	the commander ordered Paul to be brought into headquarters. He said Paul should be examined by lashing, so that he might find out why they were shouting against him so. 
ACT.22.25	But when they stretched him out with straps, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen without due process?” 
ACT.22.26	Now when the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it, saying, “What are you going to do? For this man is Roman.” 
ACT.22.27	The commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you Roman?” And he said, “Yes.” 
ACT.22.28	The commander answered, “I bought this citizenship for a large sum.” Paul said, “But I was born so.” 
ACT.22.29	Therefore, those who were about to interrogate him instantly drew back from him. And the commander also was afraid when he found out that Paul was a Roman and that he had bound him. 
ACT.22.30	But on the next day, desiring to know exactly why Paul had been accused by the Judeans, he released him and commanded the ruling 
ACT.23.1	Paul, looking intently at the Sanhedrin, said, “Brothers, I have lived my life in all good conscience for God up to this day.” 
ACT.23.2	But the 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you on the mouth, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit judging me according to the 
ACT.23.4	Those standing nearby said, “Do you insult God’s 
ACT.23.5	Paul said, “I didn’t know, brothers, that he is the 
ACT.23.6	But recognizing that one group was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul began crying out in the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees! I am on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead!” 
ACT.23.7	When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees affirm them all. 
ACT.23.9	Then there was a great uproar. Some of the 
ACT.23.10	As a big dispute was developing, the commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them. So he ordered the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and to bring him into headquarters. 
ACT.23.11	The following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, “Take courage! For just as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome!”
ACT.23.12	When it was day, the Judean leaders formed a conspiracy. They bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty who formed this plot. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the ruling 
ACT.23.15	So now you and the Sanhedrin serve notice to the commander to bring him down to you—like you are about to investigate his case more thoroughly. But we are ready to kill him before he comes near.” 
ACT.23.16	But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush. He went into the headquarters and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has a message for him.” 
ACT.23.18	So the centurion took him and led him to the commander and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.” 
ACT.23.19	The commander took him by the hand, stepped aside, and began asking him privately, “What is it that you have to report to me?” 
ACT.23.20	And he said, “The Judean leaders have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow—as if they are about to investigate more thoroughly about him. 
ACT.23.21	But do not give in to them, for more than forty of them have bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Even now, they are ready and waiting for your consent.” 
ACT.23.22	So the commander dismissed the young man, charging him, “Tell no one that you have informed me about these things.”
ACT.23.23	Calling two of his centurions, he said, “At the third hour of the night, prepare two hundred soldiers, along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to proceed as far as Caesarea. 
ACT.23.24	Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, so that he might be brought safely to Felix the governor.” 
ACT.23.25	He wrote a letter to this effect: 
ACT.23.26	“Claudius Lysias, To the Most Excellent Governor Felix: Greetings! 
ACT.23.27	This man was seized by the Judean leaders and was about to be killed by them, when I came on the scene with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman citizen. 
ACT.23.28	Desiring to know the charge of which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin. 
ACT.23.29	I found that he was accused concerning issues of their law, but charged with nothing worthy of death or imprisonment. 
ACT.23.30	When I was informed that there was a plot against the man, I sent him to you immediately, also ordering his accusers to state before you what they have against him.” 
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers, in keeping with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	On the next day, they returned to headquarters, leaving the horsemen to go on with him. 
ACT.23.33	When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul before him. 
ACT.23.34	Upon reading the letter, the governor asked what province he was from. When he learned that Paul was from Cilicia, 
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers have arrived also.” Then he gave orders for Paul to be guarded in Herod’s Praetorium. 
ACT.24.1	After five days, the 
ACT.24.2	When Paul was called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We are enjoying much peace through you, and reforms are introduced for this nation because of your foresight. 
ACT.24.3	We acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, in every way and every place with all gratitude. 
ACT.24.4	“But in order that I may not weary you any longer, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man to be a pest, stirring up riots among all the Jewish people throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Natzratim. 
ACT.24.6	He even tried to defile the Temple, but we seized him. 
ACT.24.8	By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn from him all these things about which we accuse him.” 
ACT.24.9	The Judean leaders also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were true. 
ACT.24.10	When the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul responded: “Knowing that you have been judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my own defense. 
ACT.24.11	As you can verify, it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
ACT.24.12	They did not find me arguing with anyone or inciting a riot—not in the Temple or in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. 
ACT.24.13	Nor can they prove to you the charges they now bring against me. 
ACT.24.14	“But this I confess to you, that according to the Way (which they call a sect), I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything written in the 
ACT.24.15	In God I have a hope—which these men also wait for—that there will surely be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. 
ACT.24.16	“Therefore I do my best always to have a clear conscience before both God and men. 
ACT.24.17	Now after several years, I came to bring 
ACT.24.18	As I was doing this, they found me in the Temple, having been purified—without any crowd or uproar. 
ACT.24.19	But there were some Jewish people from Asia, who ought to be here before you to press charges if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin— 
ACT.24.21	except for this one cry I shouted out while standing among them: ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that today I am on trial before you.’”
ACT.24.22	But Felix, having a rather extensive knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will rule on your case.” 
ACT.24.23	Then he gave the centurion orders for Paul to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from attending to his needs. 
ACT.24.24	Now some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Messiah 
ACT.24.25	But as he was arguing about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “Go away for now! When I find time, I will summon you.” 
ACT.24.26	At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given to him by Paul; so he sent for him frequently and would talk with him. 
ACT.24.27	But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wishing to do the Judean leaders a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
ACT.25.1	Three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 
ACT.25.2	There the ruling 
ACT.25.3	asking a favor—to have Paul sent to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him on the road. 
ACT.25.4	Festus then answered that Paul was being guarded at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to go there shortly. 
ACT.25.5	“So then,” he said, “let the prominent men among you go down with me; and if there is any wrong in the man, let them accuse him.” 
ACT.25.6	After spending not more than eight to ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea. The next day, he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought in. 
ACT.25.7	When he arrived, the Judeans who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many serious charges which they could not prove. 
ACT.25.8	Paul said in his defense, “I have committed no offense against the 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, wanting to do the Jewish leaders a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me?” 
ACT.25.10	But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Judeans, as you very well know. 
ACT.25.11	If then I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges, no one can turn me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!” 
ACT.25.12	Then when Festus had consulted with the council, he responded, “You have appealed to Caesar—to Caesar you shall go!”
ACT.25.13	Now after several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. 
ACT.25.14	While they were staying there several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man left behind as a prisoner by Felix. 
ACT.25.15	When I was in Jerusalem, the ruling 
ACT.25.16	I answered them that it is not Roman practice to turn over anyone before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense concerning the charges. 
ACT.25.17	So when they came together here, I did not delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought in. 
ACT.25.18	When the accusers stood up, they were not bringing a charge of what crimes I suspected. 
ACT.25.19	Instead, they had certain issues with him about their own religion and about a certain 
ACT.25.20	“Since I was at a loss as to how to investigate these matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem to be tried there in regard to them. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.” 
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.” 
ACT.25.23	So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pageantry. They entered the audience hall with the commanders and the most prominent men of the city. Then at the order of Festus, Paul was brought in. 
ACT.25.24	Festus said, “King Agrippa and all present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Judean population petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting out that he ought not live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death; and when he himself appealed to His Majesty the Emperor, I decided to send him. 
ACT.25.26	Yet I have nothing specific to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you—and especially before you, King Agrippa—so that after the investigation has taken place, I might have something to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it seems illogical to me when sending a prisoner, not to report also the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	Agrippa said to Paul, “It is permitted for you to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense. 
ACT.26.2	“Concerning all I am accused of by the Judean leaders, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that it is before you that I am about to make my defense today— 
ACT.26.3	since you are especially knowledgeable about all Jewish customs and issues. Therefore I beg you to listen patiently to me. 
ACT.26.4	“Now all the Jewish people have known my manner of life ever since my youth, starting from the beginning in my own nation and also in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	They have known about me for a long time—if they were willing to testify—that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee. 
ACT.26.6	“Yet now I stand here being judged for the hope in the promise made by God to our fathers. 
ACT.26.7	It is the promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jewish people, O King! 
ACT.26.8	Why is it judged incredible by any of you that God raises the dead? 
ACT.26.9	“In fact, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things in opposition to the name of 
ACT.26.10	And that is what I did in Jerusalem. Not only did I lock up many of the 
ACT.26.11	I tried to cause them to blaspheme by punishing them often in the synagogues. In furious rage against them, I persecuted them even in foreign cities. 
ACT.26.12	“While journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the ruling 
ACT.26.13	at midday, O King, I saw on the road a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me. 
ACT.26.14	When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against goads!’ 
ACT.26.15	“Then I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “And the Lord said, ‘I am 
ACT.26.16	But get up, and stand on your feet. For I have appeared to you for this purpose—to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things you have seen as well as to the things I will yet reveal to you. 
ACT.26.17	I will rescue you from your own people, and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you, 
ACT.26.18	to open their eyes—so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to God, that they may receive release from sins as well as a place among those who are made holy through trusting in Me.’ 
ACT.26.19	“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. 
ACT.26.20	Rather, I kept declaring—first to those in Damascus, and then Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also the Gentiles—that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with that repentance. 
ACT.26.21	“For this reason some Judeans seized me in the Temple and tried to put me to death. 
ACT.26.22	Since I have had God’s help, to this day I have stood here testifying to both small and great. I am saying nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to happen— 
ACT.26.23	that the Messiah was to suffer and that, being first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light both to our people and to the nations.” 
ACT.26.24	As Paul was thus making his defense, Festus says with a loud voice, “You’re crazy, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane!” 
ACT.26.25	But Paul declares, “I am not insane, most noble Festus! Rather I am speaking the sober truth. 
ACT.26.26	For the king knows about these things, and I speak freely to him, since I am convinced that none of these things escape his notice—for this was not done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do believe!” 
ACT.26.28	Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time you are trying to persuade me to be Messianic!” 
ACT.26.29	And Paul said, “Whether short or long, I would pray to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today would be such as I am—except for these chains!” 
ACT.26.30	Then the king stood up, as well as the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them. 
ACT.26.31	When they had gone away, they began talking among themselves, saying, “This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.” 
ACT.26.32	Then Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free, if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
ACT.27.1	When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan Cohort. 
ACT.27.2	So we boarded a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, and we set out to sea—accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. 
ACT.27.3	The next day we set down at Sidon. Julius, treating Paul kindly, let him go to his friends to receive care. 
ACT.27.4	Setting out to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 
ACT.27.5	When we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra in Lysia. 
ACT.27.6	There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board. 
ACT.27.7	Sailing slowly for a number of days, with difficulty we made it to Cnidus. As the wind did not allow us to go further, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea. 
ACT.27.9	Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was already dangerous because the Fast had already gone by, Paul kept warning them, 
ACT.27.10	telling them, “Men, I can see that the voyage is about to end in disaster and great loss—not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives!” 
ACT.27.11	But the centurion was persuaded more by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was said by Paul. 
ACT.27.12	And because the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to set out to sea from there—if somehow they might reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there.
ACT.27.13	When the south wind blew gently, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they raised the anchor and started coasting along the shore by Crete. 
ACT.27.14	But before long, a hurricane-force wind called “the Northeaster” swept down from the island. 
ACT.27.15	When the ship was caught and could not face into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. 
ACT.27.16	As we ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to get control of the dinghy. 
ACT.27.17	When the crew had hoisted it up, they made use of ropes to undergird the ship. Then fearing they might run aground on the Syrtis, they let down the anchor and so were driven along. 
ACT.27.18	But as we were violently battered by the storm, the next day they began throwing cargo overboard. 
ACT.27.19	On the third day, they threw out the ship’s gear with their own hands. 
ACT.27.20	With neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm pressing on us, all hope of our survival was vanishing. 
ACT.27.21	As they had long been without food, Paul stood up in their midst and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not sailed from Crete, to avoid this disaster and loss. 
ACT.27.22	Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you—but only of the ship. 
ACT.27.23	For this very night, there came to me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve. 
ACT.27.24	He said, ‘Do not fear, Paul. You must stand before Caesar; and indeed, God has granted you all who are sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So take heart, men, for I trust God that it will be exactly as I have been told. 
ACT.27.26	But we must run aground on some island.” 
ACT.27.27	Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were drifting across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to sense that they were nearing some land. 
ACT.27.28	So they took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep. A bit farther along, they took another sounding and found it was fifteen fathoms deep. 
ACT.27.29	Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern. They were longing for day to come. 
ACT.27.30	Now the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had lowered the dinghy into the sea, pretending they were going to put out anchors from the bow. 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain on the ship, you cannot be saved!” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the dinghy and let it drift away. 
ACT.27.33	As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have kept waiting and going without food, having taken nothing. 
ACT.27.34	Therefore, I urge you to take some food—for this is for your survival, since not one of you will lose a hair from his head.” 
ACT.27.35	And when he had said these things, he took bread, gave thanks to God before them all, broke it, and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	Then all were encouraged and took some food themselves. 
ACT.27.37	(In all we were 276 persons on the ship.) 
ACT.27.38	When they had eaten enough, they began to lighten the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea. 
ACT.27.39	Then when daylight came, they did not recognize the land; but they noticed a bay with a beach, where they planned to run the ship aground if they could. 
ACT.27.40	So they cut off the anchors and left them in the sea, while loosening the ropes of the rudders at the same time. Then, hoisting the forward sail to the wind, they made for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But they struck a sandbar between the seas and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, and the stern began to break up by the pounding of the waves. 
ACT.27.42	The plan of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would escape by swimming away. 
ACT.27.43	But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to land— 
ACT.27.44	and the rest to get there on boards and pieces of the ship. And in this way all were brought safely to land.
ACT.28.1	Once safely ashore, we learned that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The natives showed us unusual kindness. Because it had started raining and it was cold, they kindled a fire and welcomed us all. 
ACT.28.3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and placed it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand. 
ACT.28.4	When the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer! Though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.” 
ACT.28.5	However, Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm. 
ACT.28.6	They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead—but after they waited a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and began to say he was a god. 
ACT.28.7	Now in the vicinity around that place were lands belonging to the most prominent man of the island, named Publius. He welcomed us and hosted us warmly for three days. 
ACT.28.8	It so happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with a fever and dysentery. Paul visited him and, when he had prayed and laid hands on him, he healed him. 
ACT.28.9	After this happened, the rest of the sick on the island started coming and getting healed. 
ACT.28.10	They also heaped honors on us; and when we sailed, they put on board all the supplies we needed. 
ACT.28.11	After three months, we set sail in a ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island, with the Twin Brothers as its figurehead. 
ACT.28.12	Setting down at Syracuse, we stayed there three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we got underway and reached Rhegium; and a day later a south wind came up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	There we found some brothers and sisters, and we were invited to stay with them for seven days. And in this way we came to Rome. 
ACT.28.15	Now the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he gave thanks to God and took courage. 
ACT.28.16	When we entered Rome, Paul was permitted to remain in his own quarters, with a soldier guarding him.
ACT.28.17	It happened that after three days, Paul called together those who were the prominent Jewish leaders. When they had gathered he said to them, “Brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
ACT.28.18	When they examined me, they wanted to release me because there was no basis for the death penalty. 
ACT.28.19	But when the Judean leaders protested, I was forced to appeal to Caesar—not that I had any charge to bring against my own nation. 
ACT.28.20	For this reason, therefore, I have requested to see you and to speak with you—since it is for the hope of Israel that I am bearing this chain.” 
ACT.28.21	They said to him, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we think it appropriate to hear from you about what you think. For indeed, it is known to us that regarding this sect, it is spoken against everywhere.” 
ACT.28.23	They set a day to meet Paul and came to him at his quarters in large numbers. From morning until evening he was explaining everything to them, testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them about 
ACT.28.24	Some were convinced by what he said, while others refused to believe. 
ACT.28.25	So when they disagreed among themselves, they began leaving after Paul had said one last statement: “The 
ACT.28.26	saying, ‘Go to this people and say, “You will keep on hearing but will never understand; you will keep looking, but will never see. 
ACT.28.27	For the heart of this people has become dull, their ears can barely hear, and they have shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts. Then they would turn back, and I would heal them.”’ 
ACT.28.28	Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!” 
ACT.28.30	Paul remained two whole years in his own rented quarters and continued to welcome all who came to him— 
ACT.28.31	proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord 
ROM.1.1	Paul, a slave of Messiah 
ROM.1.2	which He announced beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures. 
ROM.1.3	Concerning His Son, He came into being from the seed of David according to the flesh. 
ROM.1.4	He was appointed 
ROM.1.5	Through Him we have received grace and the office of emissary, to bring about obedience of faith among all the nations on behalf of His name. 
ROM.1.6	And you also are called to 
ROM.1.7	To all those in Rome, loved by God, called to be 
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Messiah 
ROM.1.9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the Good News of His Son. How unceasingly I make mention of you, 
ROM.1.10	always pleading in my prayers, if somehow by God’s will now at last I will be granted a good journey to come to you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, so I may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you. 
ROM.1.12	That is to say, we would be encouraged together by one another’s faithfulness—both yours and mine. 
ROM.1.13	I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that many times I planned to come to you (though I was prevented until now)—so I might have some fruit among you also, just as I have among the rest of the nations. 
ROM.1.14	I have an obligation to both Greeks and barbarians, to both the wise and the foolish. 
ROM.1.15	So I am eager to proclaim the Good News also to you who are in Rome. 
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the Good News, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who trusts—to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.1.17	In it the righteousness of God is revealed, from trust to trust. As it is written, “But the righteous shall live by 
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. In unrighteousness they suppress the truth, 
ROM.1.19	because what can be known about God is plain to them—for God has shown it to them. 
ROM.1.20	His invisible attributes—His eternal power and His divine nature—have been clearly seen ever since the creation of the world, being understood through the things that have been made. So people are without excuse— 
ROM.1.21	for even though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or give Him thanks. Instead, their thinking became futile, and their senseless hearts were made dark. 
ROM.1.22	Claiming to be wise, they became fools. 
ROM.1.23	They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image in the form of mortal man and birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things. 
ROM.1.24	Therefore God gave them over in the evil desires of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies with one another. 
ROM.1.25	They traded the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. 
ROM.1.26	For this reason God gave them up to shameful passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for what is against nature. 
ROM.1.27	Likewise the men abandoned natural relations with women and were burning with passion toward one another—men committing shameful acts with other men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. 
ROM.1.28	And just as they did not see fit to recognize God, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what is not fitting. 
ROM.1.29	They became filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice. They are gossips, 
ROM.1.30	slanderers, God-haters, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents. 
ROM.1.31	They are foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 
ROM.1.32	Though they know God’s righteous decree—that those who practice such things deserve death—they not only do them but also approve of others who practice the same.
ROM.2.1	Therefore you are without excuse, O man—every one of you who is judging. For by whatever you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. 
ROM.2.2	We know that God’s judgment on those who practice such things is based on truth. 
ROM.2.3	But you, O man—judging those practicing such things yet doing the same—do you suppose that you will escape the judgment of God? 
ROM.2.4	Or do you belittle the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience—not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance? 
ROM.2.5	But by your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed. 
ROM.2.6	He will pay back each person according to his deeds. 
ROM.2.7	To those who by perseverance in doing good are seeking glory, honor, and immortality—eternal life. 
ROM.2.8	But to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness—wrath and fury. 
ROM.2.9	There will be trouble and hardship for every human soul that does evil—to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.2.10	But there will be glory, honor, and 
ROM.2.11	For there is no partiality with God. 
ROM.2.12	For all who have sinned outside of 
ROM.2.13	For it is not the hearers of 
ROM.2.14	For when Gentiles, who do not have the 
ROM.2.15	They show that the work of the 
ROM.2.16	on the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my Good News through Messiah 
ROM.2.17	But if you call yourself Jewish and rely upon the 
ROM.2.18	and know His will and determine what matters because you are instructed from the 
ROM.2.19	and you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the 
ROM.2.21	you then who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples? 
ROM.2.23	You who take pride in the 
ROM.2.24	For as it is written, “the name of God is slandered among the nations because of you.” 
ROM.2.25	Circumcision is indeed worthwhile if you keep the 
ROM.2.26	Therefore, if the uncircumcised keeps the righteous decrees of the 
ROM.2.27	Indeed, the one not circumcised physically who fulfills the 
ROM.2.28	For one is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something visible in the flesh. 
ROM.2.29	Rather, the Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart—in Spirit not in letter. His praise is not from men, but from God. 
ROM.3.1	Then what is the advantage of being Jewish? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Much in every way. First of all, they were entrusted with the sayings of God. 
ROM.3.3	So what if some did not trust? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness? 
ROM.3.4	May it never be! Let God be true even if every man is a liar, as it is written, “that You may be righteous in Your words and prevail when You are judged.” 
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God is not unrighteous to inflict wrath, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.) 
ROM.3.6	May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	But if by my lie the truth of God abounds to His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	And why not say, “Let us do evil, so that good may come” — just as we are being slandered and as some claim that we say. Their condemnation is deserved! 
ROM.3.9	What then? Are we better than they? No, not at all. For we have already made the case that all—both Jewish and Greek people—are under sin. 
ROM.3.10	As it is written, “There is no one righteous—no, not one. 
ROM.3.11	There is no one who understands, no one who seeks after God. 
ROM.3.12	All have turned aside; together they have become worthless. There is no one who does good—no, not even one! 
ROM.3.13	Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they keep deceiving. The poison of vipers is under their lips. 
ROM.3.14	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. 
ROM.3.15	Their feet are swift to shed blood. 
ROM.3.16	Ruin and misery are in their paths, 
ROM.3.17	and the way of 
ROM.3.18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.” 
ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever the 
ROM.3.20	For no human, on the basis of 
ROM.3.21	But now God’s righteousness apart from the 
ROM.3.22	namely, the righteousness of God through putting trust in Messiah 
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. 
ROM.3.24	They are set right as a gift of His grace, through the redemption that is in Messiah 
ROM.3.25	God set forth 
ROM.3.26	Through God’s forbearance, He demonstrates His righteousness at the present time—that He Himself is just and also the justifier of the one who puts his trust in 
ROM.3.27	Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what principle? Of works? No, but by the principle of faith. 
ROM.3.28	For we consider a person to be set right apart from 
ROM.3.29	Is God the God of the Jewish people only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also. 
ROM.3.30	Since God is One, He will set right the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 
ROM.3.31	Do we then nullify the 
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham was set right by works, he has something to boast about—but not before God. 
ROM.4.3	For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” 
ROM.4.4	Now to the one who works, the pay is not credited as a gift, but as what is due. 
ROM.4.5	But to the one who does not work, but trusts in Him who justifies the ungodly, his trust is credited as righteousness— 
ROM.4.6	just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 
ROM.4.7	“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins are covered. 
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the man whose sin 
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing then only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? For we say, “trust was credited to Abraham as righteousness.” 
ROM.4.10	In what state then was it credited? While circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised! 
ROM.4.11	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the trust he had while he was uncircumcised, so he might be the father of all who are trusting while uncircumcised—that righteousness might be credited to them as well. 
ROM.4.12	Also he is the father of the circumcised, to those not only circumcised but also walking in the footsteps of the trust of our father Abraham before his circumcision.
ROM.4.13	For the promise to Abraham or to his seed—to become heir of the world—was not through law, but through the righteousness based on trust. 
ROM.4.14	For if those who are of the 
ROM.4.15	For the 
ROM.4.16	For this reason it depends on trust, so that the promise according to grace might be guaranteed to all the offspring—not only to those of the 
ROM.4.17	(as it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations”). He is our father in the sight of God in whom he trusted, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence that which does not exist. 
ROM.4.18	In hope beyond hope, he trusted that he would become the father of many nations according to what was spoken—“So shall your descendants be.” 
ROM.4.19	And without becoming weak in faith, he considered his own body—as good as dead, since he was already a hundred years old—and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. 
ROM.4.20	Yet he did not waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God. Rather, he was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God. 
ROM.4.21	He was fully convinced that what God has promised, He also is able to do. 
ROM.4.22	That is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” 
ROM.4.23	Now not only for his sake was it written that it was credited to him, 
ROM.4.24	but for our sake as well. It is credited to us as those who trust in Him who raised 
ROM.4.25	He was handed over for our transgressions and raised up for the sake of setting us right.
ROM.5.1	Therefore, having been made righteous by trusting, we have 
ROM.5.2	Through Him we also have gained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast in the hope of God’s glory. 
ROM.5.3	And not only that, but we also boast in suffering—knowing that suffering produces perseverance; 
ROM.5.4	and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 
ROM.5.5	And hope does not disappoint, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the 
ROM.5.6	For while we were still helpless, at the right time Messiah died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	For rarely will anyone die for a righteous man—though perhaps for a good man someone might even dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Messiah died for us. 
ROM.5.9	How much more then, having now been set right by His blood, shall we be saved from God’s wrath through Him. 
ROM.5.10	For if, while we were yet enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by His life. 
ROM.5.11	And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord 
ROM.5.12	So then, just as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, in the same way death spread to all men because all sinned. 
ROM.5.13	For up until the 
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in a manner similar to the violation of Adam, who is a pattern of the One to come. 
ROM.5.15	But the gracious gift is not like the transgression. For if many died because of the transgression of one man, how much more did the grace of God overflow to many through the gift of one Man—
ROM.5.16	Moreover, the gift is not like what happened through the one who sinned. For on the one hand, the judgment from one violation resulted in condemnation; but on the other hand, the gracious gift following many transgressions resulted in justification. 
ROM.5.17	For if by the one man’s transgression, death reigned through the one, how much more shall those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the One, Messiah 
ROM.5.18	So then, through the transgression of one, condemnation came to all men; likewise, through the righteousness of one came righteousness of life to all men. 
ROM.5.19	For just as through the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of one man, many will be set right forever. 
ROM.5.20	Now the 
ROM.5.21	so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness, to eternal life through Messiah 
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may abound? 
ROM.6.2	May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
ROM.6.3	Or do you not know that all of us who were immersed into Messiah 
ROM.6.4	Therefore we were buried together with Him through immersion into death—in order that just as Messiah was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. 
ROM.6.5	For if we have become joined together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also will be joined together in His resurrection— 
ROM.6.6	knowing our old man was crucified with Him so that the sinful body might be done away with, so we no longer serve sin. 
ROM.6.7	For he who has died is set free from sin. 
ROM.6.8	Now if we have died with Messiah, we believe that we shall also live with Him. 
ROM.6.9	We know that Messiah, having been raised from the dead, no longer dies; death no longer is master over Him. 
ROM.6.10	For the death He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life He lives, He lives to God. 
ROM.6.11	So also continually count yourselves both dead to sin and alive to God in Messiah 
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin rule in your mortal body so that you obey its desires. 
ROM.6.13	And do not keep yielding your body parts to sin as tools of wickedness; but yield yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your body parts as tools of righteousness to God. 
ROM.6.14	For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace. 
ROM.6.15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be! 
ROM.6.16	Do you not know that to whatever you yield yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves to what you obey—whether to sin resulting in death, or to obedience resulting in righteousness? 
ROM.6.17	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching under which you were placed; 
ROM.6.18	and after you were set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you yielded your body parts as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness, leading to more lawlessness, so now yield your body parts as slaves to righteousness, resulting in holiness. 
ROM.6.20	For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness. 
ROM.6.21	So then, what outcome did you have that you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. 
ROM.6.22	But now, having been set free from sin and having become enslaved to God, you have your fruit resulting in holiness. And the outcome is eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For sin’s payment is death, but God’s gracious gift is eternal life in Messiah 
ROM.7.1	Or do you not know, brothers and sisters (for I speak to those who know law), that the law is master over a person as long as he lives? 
ROM.7.2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives; but if the husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband. 
ROM.7.3	So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law—so she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man. 
ROM.7.4	Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were made dead to the 
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions that came through the 
ROM.7.6	But now we have been released from the law, having died to what confined us, so that we serve in the new way of the 
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? Is the 
ROM.7.8	But sin, taking an opportunity, worked in me through the commandment all kinds of coveting. For apart from the 
ROM.7.9	Once I was alive apart from the 
ROM.7.10	and I died. The commandment meant for life was found to cause death. 
ROM.7.11	Sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. 
ROM.7.12	So then, the 
ROM.7.13	Therefore did that which is good become death to me? May it never be! Rather it was sin working death in me—through that which is good—so that sin might be shown to be sin, and that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. 
ROM.7.14	For we know that the 
ROM.7.15	For I do not understand what I am doing—for what I do not want, this I practice; but what I hate, this I do. 
ROM.7.16	But if I do what I do not want to do, then I agree with the 
ROM.7.17	So now it is no longer I doing it, but sin dwelling in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that nothing good dwells in me—that is, in my flesh. For to will is present in me, but to do the good is not. 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I want, I do not do; but the evil that I do not want, this I practice. 
ROM.7.20	But if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me. 
ROM.7.21	So I find the principle—that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. 
ROM.7.22	For I delight in the 
ROM.7.23	but I see a different law in my body parts, battling against the law of my mind and bringing me into bondage under the law of sin which is in my body parts. 
ROM.7.24	Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
ROM.7.25	Thanks be to God—it is through Messiah 
ROM.8.1	Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Messiah 
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Messiah 
ROM.8.3	For what was impossible for the 
ROM.8.4	so that the requirement of the 
ROM.8.5	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the 
ROM.8.6	For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the 
ROM.8.7	For the mindset of the flesh is hostile toward God, for it does not submit itself to the law of God—for it cannot. 
ROM.8.8	So those who are in the flesh cannot please God. 
ROM.8.9	However, you are not in the flesh but in the 
ROM.8.10	But if Messiah is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the Spirit is alive because of righteousness. 
ROM.8.11	And if the 
ROM.8.12	So then, brothers and sisters, we do not owe anything to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 
ROM.8.13	For if you live according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the 
ROM.8.14	For all who are led by the 
ROM.8.15	For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall again into fear; rather, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” 
ROM.8.16	The 
ROM.8.17	And if children, also heirs—heirs of God and joint-heirs with Messiah—if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.
ROM.8.18	For I consider the sufferings of this present time not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us. 
ROM.8.19	For the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God. 
ROM.8.20	For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly but because of the One who subjected it—in hope 
ROM.8.21	that the creation itself also will be set free from bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God. 
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers birth pains until now— 
ROM.8.23	and not only creation, but even ourselves. We ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the 
ROM.8.24	For in hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not see, then we eagerly wait for it with perseverance. 
ROM.8.26	In the same way, the 
ROM.8.27	And He who searches the hearts knows the mind of the 
ROM.8.28	Now we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to His purpose. 
ROM.8.29	For those whom He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. 
ROM.8.30	And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified. 
ROM.8.31	What then shall we say in view of these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
ROM.8.32	He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. 
ROM.8.34	Who is the one who condemns? It is Messiah, who died, and moreover was raised, and is now at the right hand of God and who also intercedes for us. 
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Messiah? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? 
ROM.8.36	As it is written, “For Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.” 
ROM.8.37	But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, 
ROM.8.39	nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Messiah 
ROM.9.1	I tell the truth in Messiah—I do not lie, my conscience assuring me in the 
ROM.9.2	that my sorrow is great and the anguish in my heart unending. 
ROM.9.3	For I would pray that I myself were cursed, banished from Messiah for the sake of my people—my own flesh and blood, 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the 
ROM.9.5	To them belong the patriarchs—and from them, according to the flesh, the Messiah, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen. 
ROM.9.6	But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are Israel, 
ROM.9.7	nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s seed; rather, “Your seed shall be called through Isaac.” 
ROM.9.8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God; rather, the children of the promise are counted as seed. 
ROM.9.9	For the word of promise is this: “At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.” 
ROM.9.10	And not only this, but also Rebecca having twins, from one act with our father Isaac. 
ROM.9.11	Yet before the sons were even born and had not done anything good or bad—so that God’s purpose and choice might stand not because of works but because of Him who calls— 
ROM.9.12	it was said to her, “The older shall serve the younger.” 
ROM.9.13	As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” 
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! 
ROM.9.15	For to Moses He says, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” 
ROM.9.16	So then it does not depend on the one who wills or the one who strives, but on God who shows mercy. 
ROM.9.17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I raised you up—to demonstrate My power in you, so My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” 
ROM.9.18	So then He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills. 
ROM.9.19	You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who has resisted His will?” 
ROM.9.20	But who in the world are you, O man, who talks back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?” 
ROM.9.21	Does the potter have no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honor and another for common use? 
ROM.9.22	Now what if God, willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath designed for destruction? 
ROM.9.23	And what if He did so to make known the riches of His glory on vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory? 
ROM.9.24	Even us He called—not only from the Jewish people, but also from the Gentiles— 
ROM.9.25	as He says also in Hosea, “I will call those who were not My people, ‘My people,’ and her who was not loved, ‘Beloved.’ 
ROM.9.26	And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ there they shall be called sons of the living God.” 
ROM.9.27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Though the number of B’nei-Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant shall be saved. 
ROM.9.28	For 
ROM.9.29	And just as Isaiah foretold, “Unless 
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness—that is, a righteousness of faith. 
ROM.9.31	But Israel, who pursued a 
ROM.9.32	Why? Because they pursued it not by faith, but as if it were from works. They stumbled over the stone of stumbling, 
ROM.9.33	just as it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and whoever believes in Him shall not be put to shame.”
ROM.10.1	Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation. 
ROM.10.2	For I testify about them that they have zeal for God—but not based on knowledge. 
ROM.10.3	For being ignorant of God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit themselves to the righteousness of God. 
ROM.10.4	For Messiah is the goal of the 
ROM.10.5	For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness based on faith speaks in this way: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will go up into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Messiah down), 
ROM.10.7	or, ‘Who will go down into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Messiah up from the dead).” 
ROM.10.8	But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” —that is, the word of faith that we are proclaiming: 
ROM.10.9	For if you confess with your mouth that 
ROM.10.10	For with the heart it is believed for righteousness, and with the mouth it is confessed for salvation. 
ROM.10.11	For the Scripture says, “Whoever trusts in Him will not be put to shame.” 
ROM.10.12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all—richly generous to all who call on Him. 
ROM.10.13	For “Everyone who calls upon the name of 
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on the One in whom they have not trusted? And how shall they trust in the One they have not heard of? And how shall they hear without someone proclaiming? 
ROM.10.15	And how shall they proclaim unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim good news of good things!” 
ROM.10.16	But not all heeded the Good News. For Isaiah says, “
ROM.10.17	So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Messiah. 
ROM.10.18	But I say, have they never heard? Indeed they have, for “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.” 
ROM.10.19	But I say, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, with a nation empty of understanding I will vex you.” 
ROM.10.20	And Isaiah is so bold as to say, “I was found by those who did not seek Me; I became visible to those who did not ask for Me.” 
ROM.10.21	But about Israel He says, “All day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
ROM.11.1	I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	God has not rejected His people whom He knew beforehand. Or do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 
ROM.11.3	“
ROM.11.4	But what is the divine response to him? “I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” 
ROM.11.5	So in the same way also at this present time there has come to be a remnant according to God’s gracious choice. 
ROM.11.6	But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 
ROM.11.7	What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained; but the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened— 
ROM.11.8	just as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes not to see and ears not to hear, until this very day.” 
ROM.11.9	And David says, “Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them. 
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened so they do not see, and bend their back continually.” 
ROM.11.11	I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their false step salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke Israel to jealousy. 
ROM.11.12	Now if their transgression leads to riches for the world, and their loss riches for the Gentiles, then how much more their fullness! 
ROM.11.13	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Insofar as I am an emissary to the Gentiles, I spotlight my ministry 
ROM.11.14	if somehow I might provoke to jealousy my own flesh and blood and save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	For if their rejection leads to the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
ROM.11.16	If the firstfruit is holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 
ROM.11.17	But if some of the branches were broken off and you—being a wild olive—were grafted in among them and became a partaker of the root of the olive tree with its richness, 
ROM.11.18	do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, it is not you who support the root but the root supports you. 
ROM.11.19	You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	True enough. They were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear— 
ROM.11.21	for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you. 
ROM.11.22	Notice then the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell; but God’s kindness toward you, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off! 
ROM.11.23	And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if you were cut out of that which by nature is a wild olive tree, and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? 
ROM.11.25	For I do not want you, brothers and sisters, to be ignorant of this mystery—lest you be wise in your own eyes—that a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; 
ROM.11.26	and in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer shall come out of Zion. He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 
ROM.11.27	And this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.” 
ROM.11.28	Concerning the Good News, they are hostile for your sake; but concerning chosenness, they are loved on account of the fathers— 
ROM.11.29	for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 
ROM.11.30	For just as you once were disobedient to God but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	in like manner these also have now been disobedient with the result that, because of the mercy shown to you, they also may receive mercy. 
ROM.11.32	For God has shut up all in disobedience, so that He might show mercy to all. 
ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how incomprehensible His ways! 
ROM.11.34	For “who has known the mind of 
ROM.11.35	Or “who has first given to Him, that it shall be repaid to him?” 
ROM.11.36	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen. 
ROM.12.1	I urge you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice—holy, acceptable to God—which is your spiritual service. 
ROM.12.2	Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the will of God—what is good and acceptable and perfect. 
ROM.12.3	For through the grace given me, I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think—but to use sound judgment, as God has assigned to each person a measure of faith. 
ROM.12.4	For just as we have many parts in one body—and all the parts do not have the same function— 
ROM.12.5	so we, who are many, are one body in Messiah and everyone parts of one another. 
ROM.12.6	We have gifts that differ according to the grace that was given to us—if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; 
ROM.12.7	if service, in our serving; or the one who teaches, in his teaching; 
ROM.12.8	or the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who gives, in generosity; the one who leads, with diligence; the one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 
ROM.12.9	Let love be without hypocrisy—detesting what is evil, holding fast to the good. 
ROM.12.10	Be tenderly devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo one another in giving honor. 
ROM.12.11	Do not be lagging in zeal; be fervent in spirit. Keep serving the Lord, 
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope, enduring in distress, persisting in prayer, 
ROM.12.13	contributing to the needs of the 
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you—bless and do not curse. 
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	Live in harmony with one another; do not be proud, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own eyes. 
ROM.12.17	Repay no one evil for evil; give thought to what is good in the eyes of all people. 
ROM.12.18	If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in 
ROM.12.19	Never take your own revenge, loved ones, but give room for God’s wrath—for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,” says 
ROM.12.20	Rather, “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink. For by doing so you will heap coals of fire upon his head.” 
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let every person submit himself to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist are put in place by God. 
ROM.13.2	So whoever opposes the authority has resisted God’s direction, and those who have resisted will bring judgment on themselves. 
ROM.13.3	For leaders cause no fear for good behavior, but for bad. Now if you do not want to fear the authority, do what is good and you will get his approval— 
ROM.13.4	for he is God’s servant to you for your good. But if you do evil, be afraid—for he does not carry the sword for no reason; for he is God’s servant, an avenger who inflicts punishment on the evildoer. 
ROM.13.5	Therefore it is necessary to be in submission—not only because of punishment but also because of conscience. 
ROM.13.6	For this reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, attending diligently to this very thing. 
ROM.13.7	Pay to everyone what is due them—tribute to whom tribute is due; tax to whom tax is due; respect to whom respect is due; honor to whom honor is due. 
ROM.13.8	Owe no one anything except to love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the 
ROM.13.9	For the commandments—“You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,” and any other commandment—are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
ROM.13.10	Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fullness of the 
ROM.13.11	Besides this, you know the time—that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first came to trust. 
ROM.13.12	The night is almost gone and the day is near, so let us put off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us walk properly as in the day—not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and envy. 
ROM.13.14	Instead, put on the Lord Messiah 
ROM.14.1	Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of disputes about opinions. 
ROM.14.2	One person has faith to eat anything, but the weak eats only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	Don’t let the one who eats disparage the one who does not eat, and don’t let the one who does not eat judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him. 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to judge another’s servant? Before his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 
ROM.14.5	One person esteems one day over another while another judges every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. 
ROM.14.6	The one who observes that day does so to the Lord. The one who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and the one who abstains, abstains to the Lord, and he gives thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	For none of us lives for himself, and none dies for himself. 
ROM.14.8	For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 
ROM.14.9	For this reason Messiah died and lived again, so that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 
ROM.14.10	But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you too, why do you look down on your brother? For we all will stand before the judgment seat of God. 
ROM.14.11	For it is written, “As I live, says 
ROM.14.12	So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God. 
ROM.14.13	Therefore let us not judge one another from now on, but rather decide this—not to put a stumbling block or a trap in the way of a brother. 
ROM.14.14	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord 
ROM.14.15	For if your brother is grieved on account of food, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy by your food the one for whom Messiah died. 
ROM.14.16	Therefore do not let what is good for you be spoken of as evil— 
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but righteousness and 
ROM.14.18	For the one who serves Messiah in this manner is pleasing to God and approved by men. 
ROM.14.19	So then let us pursue what makes for 
ROM.14.20	Stop tearing down the work of God for the sake of food. Indeed all things are clean, but wrong for the man who by eating causes stumbling. 
ROM.14.21	It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything by which your brother stumbles. 
ROM.14.22	The faith you have, keep it to yourself before God. How fortunate is the one who does not condemn himself for what he approves. 
ROM.14.23	But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not of faith. And whatever is not of faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the powerless and not just please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, for building him up. 
ROM.15.3	For even Messiah did not please Himself, but as it is written, “The insults of those who insulted You have fallen on Me.” 
ROM.15.4	For whatever was written before was written for our instruction, so that through patience and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. 
ROM.15.5	Now may the God of patience and encouragement grant you to be like-minded with one another in the manner of Messiah 
ROM.15.6	so that together with one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord 
ROM.15.7	Therefore accept one another just as Messiah also accepted you, to the glory of God. 
ROM.15.8	For I declare that Messiah has become a servant to the circumcised for the sake of God’s truth, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs 
ROM.15.9	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy. As it is written, “For this reason I will give You praise among the Gentiles, and I will sing to Your name.” 
ROM.15.10	And again it says, “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.” 
ROM.15.11	And again, “Praise 
ROM.15.12	And again, Isaiah says, “There shall be a shoot of Jesse; and the One who arises to rule the Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles hope.” 
ROM.15.13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and 
ROM.15.14	Now I myself am convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and also able to counsel one another. 
ROM.15.15	But I have written rather boldly to you on some points as a reminder—because of the grace given to me by God 
ROM.15.16	to be a servant of Messiah 
ROM.15.17	So in Messiah 
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Messiah accomplished through me, to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem and around even to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the Good News of Messiah. 
ROM.15.20	In this way I make it my aim to proclaim the Good News not where Messiah was already named, lest I build on another person’s foundation, 
ROM.15.21	but as it is written, “Those who have never been told shall see, and those who have not heard shall understand.”
ROM.15.22	For this reason I was often hindered from coming to you. 
ROM.15.23	But now with no place in these regions, and since I have had a desire for many years to come to you, 
ROM.15.24	I hope to see you while traveling through when I go to Spain—and to be helped on my journey there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a bit. 
ROM.15.25	But now I am going to Jerusalem, bringing aid to the 
ROM.15.26	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the believers in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are under obligation to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they also ought to serve them in material blessings. 
ROM.15.28	So when I have finished delivering the collection safely to them, I will head for Spain by way of you. 
ROM.15.29	Now I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Messiah. 
ROM.15.30	Now I urge you, brethren, through our Lord 
ROM.15.31	Pray that I might be rescued from the unbelieving Judeans, and that my service for Jerusalem might be acceptable to the 
ROM.15.32	Then, God willing, I may come to you in joy, and together with you find rest. 
ROM.15.33	Now may the God of 
ROM.16.1	Now I recommend to you our sister Phoebe—who is a servant-leader of Messiah’s community at Cenchrea— 
ROM.16.2	so you may receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of 
ROM.16.3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Messiah 
ROM.16.4	who risked their own necks for my life. Not only I give them thanks, but also all of Messiah’s communities among the Gentiles. 
ROM.16.5	Greet also the community that meets in their house. Greet Epaenetus whom I dearly love, who is the first fruit in Asia for Messiah. 
ROM.16.6	Greet Miriam, who has worked hard for you. 
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kin and fellow prisoners who are well known among the emissaries. They were in Messiah before me. 
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, whom I dearly love in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Messiah, and Stachys whom I dearly love. 
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, who is approved in Messiah. Greet those from the household of Aristobulus. 
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those from the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. 
ROM.16.12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis whom I dearly love, who has worked hard in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother—who was also a mother to me. 
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, also Olympas and all the 
ROM.16.16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All of Messiah’s communities greet you. 
ROM.16.17	Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, to keep your eye on those who are causing divisions and stumbling blocks, contrary to the teaching that you learned. Turn away from them. 
ROM.16.18	For such people do not serve our Lord the Messiah, but only their own belly. By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting. 
ROM.16.19	Your obedience has become known to all, so I rejoice over you—but I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil. 
ROM.16.20	Now the God of 
ROM.16.21	Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kin. 
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord. 
ROM.16.23	Gaius, host to me and the whole community, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you, and so does brother Quartus.
ROM.16.24	[footnote: Some mss. add: 
ROM.16.25	Now to the One who is able to strengthen you according to my Good News and the proclamation of 
ROM.16.26	but now is revealed and through the Writings of the Prophets has been made known to all the nations, according to the commandment of the eternal God to bring about obedience of faith—

1CO.1.1	Paul, called as an emissary of Messiah 
1CO.1.2	To God’s community in Corinth—having been made holy in Messiah 
1CO.1.3	Grace to you and 
1CO.1.4	I always thank my God for you because of God’s grace that was given to you in Messiah 
1CO.1.5	For in Him you were made rich in every way—in all speaking and all knowledge— 
1CO.1.6	just as the evidence of Messiah was confirmed among you. 
1CO.1.7	So you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you eagerly wait for the revealing of our Lord 
1CO.1.8	He will also strengthen you until the end—blameless in the Day of our Lord 
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, 
1CO.1.10	Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, through the name of our Lord 
1CO.1.11	For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers and sisters, by those who are from Chloe’s household, that there are rivalries among you. 
1CO.1.12	I say this because you are each saying, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Kefa,” or “I follow Messiah.” 
1CO.1.13	Has Messiah been divided? Paul wasn’t crucified for you, was he? Or were you immersed into the name of Paul? 
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I immersed none of you, except Crispus and Gaius, 
1CO.1.15	so that no one should say that I had immersed you into my own name. 
1CO.1.16	(I also immersed the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don’t recall if I immersed anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	For Messiah sent me not to immerse, but to proclaim the Good News—not with cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Messiah would not be made of no effect. 
1CO.1.18	For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the intelligent.” 
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise one? Where is the 
1CO.1.21	For seeing that—in God’s wisdom—the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased—through the foolishness of the message proclaimed—to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	For Jewish people ask for signs and Greek people seek after wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	but we proclaim Messiah crucified—a stumbling block to Jewish people and foolishness to Gentile people, 
1CO.1.24	but to those who are called (both Jewish and Greek people), Messiah, the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 
1CO.1.26	For you see your calling, brothers and sisters, that not many are wise according to human standards, not many are powerful, and not many are born well. 
1CO.1.27	Yet God chose the foolish things of the world so He might put to shame the wise; and God chose the weak things of the world so He might put to shame the strong; 
1CO.1.28	and God chose the lowly and despised things of the world, the things that are as nothing, so He might bring to nothing the things that are— 
1CO.1.29	so that no human might boast before God. 
1CO.1.30	But because of Him you are in Messiah 
1CO.1.31	so that, just as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in 
1CO.2.1	When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with excellence of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery of God. 
1CO.2.2	For I decided not to know about anything among you except 
1CO.2.3	I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. 
1CO.2.4	My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power— 
1CO.2.5	so that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. 
1CO.2.6	We do speak wisdom, however, among those who are mature—but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 
1CO.2.7	Rather, we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery—a wisdom that has been hidden, which God destined for our glory before the ages. 
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this age understood it—for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	But as it is written, “Things no eye has seen and no ear has heard, that have not entered the heart of mankind— these things God has prepared for those who love Him.” 
1CO.2.10	But God revealed these things to us through the 
1CO.2.11	For who among men knows the things of a man, except the man’s spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the things of God except the 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God—so we might come to know the things freely given to us by God. 
1CO.2.13	These things we also speak—not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the 
1CO.2.14	Now a natural man does not accept the things of the 
1CO.2.15	But the one who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is discerned by no one. For 
1CO.2.16	“who has known the mind of 
1CO.3.1	And I, brothers and sisters, could not speak to you as Spirit-filled but as worldly—as infants in Messiah. 
1CO.3.2	I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready. Indeed, even now you are not yet ready, 
1CO.3.3	for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, aren’t you worldly and walking in a human way? 
1CO.3.4	For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere humans? 
1CO.3.5	What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you came to trust—and to each as the Lord gave. 
1CO.3.6	I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. 
1CO.3.7	So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who makes things grow. 
1CO.3.8	Now he who plants and he who waters work as one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
1CO.3.9	For we are God’s co-workers; you are God’s field, God’s building. 
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each consider carefully how he builds on it. 
1CO.3.11	For no one can lay any other foundation than what is already laid—which is 
1CO.3.12	Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 
1CO.3.13	each one’s work will become clear. For the Day will show it, because it is to be revealed by fire; and the fire itself will test each one’s work—what sort it is. 
1CO.3.14	If anyone’s work built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss—he himself will be saved, but as through fire. 
1CO.3.16	Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that the 
1CO.3.17	If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple. 
1CO.3.18	Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool so he may become wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written, “He catches the clever in their craftiness.” 
1CO.3.20	And again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are useless.” 
1CO.3.21	So let no one boast about men. For all things are yours— 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Kefa, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come. All are yours, 
1CO.3.23	and you are Messiah’s, and Messiah is God’s.
1CO.4.1	So let each one think of us in this way—as Messiah’s helpers and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
1CO.4.2	In this case, moreover, what is required of stewards is to be found trustworthy. 
1CO.4.3	But to me it matters very little to be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. 
1CO.4.4	For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this. It is the Lord who judges me. 
1CO.4.5	Therefore do not judge anything before the time—wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the things hidden in darkness and also make clear the motives of the hearts. Then the praise for each one will come from God. 
1CO.4.6	Now I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers and sisters, so you might learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against the other. 
1CO.4.7	For who makes you different? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it? 
1CO.4.8	Already you are full! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! Indeed, I wish you were kings, so we also might be kings with you! 
1CO.4.9	For it seems to me that God has put us, the emissaries, on display last of all—like men sentenced to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Messiah’s sake, but you are wise in Messiah! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored! 
1CO.4.11	To this very hour we are both hungry and thirsty, dressed in rags and mistreated and homeless. 
1CO.4.12	We toil, working with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless. When we are persecuted, we endure. 
1CO.4.13	When we are slandered, we speak kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the dregs of all things—even to this moment. 
1CO.4.14	I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to warn you as my dearly loved children. 
1CO.4.15	For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Messiah, yet you do not have many fathers. For in Messiah 
1CO.4.16	I urge you therefore—be imitators of me. 
1CO.4.17	For this reason I have sent you Timothy, my dearly loved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Messiah, just as I teach everywhere in every community. 
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing; and I will find out not the talk of those who are puffed up, but their power. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God does not consist of talk but of power. 
1CO.4.21	What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness? 
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported that among you there is sexual immorality, and such immorality as is not even among the pagans—that someone has his father’s wife. 
1CO.5.2	And you are puffed up! Shouldn’t you have mourned instead, so that the one who did this deed might be removed from among you? 
1CO.5.3	For even though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit—I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this thing, as though I were present. 
1CO.5.4	When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord 
1CO.5.5	you are to turn such a fellow over to satan for the destruction of his fleshly nature, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord 
1CO.5.6	Your boasting is no good. Don’t you know that a little 
1CO.5.7	Get rid of the old 
1CO.5.8	Therefore let us celebrate the feast not with old 
1CO.5.9	I wrote to you in my letter not to mix together with sexually immoral people— 
1CO.5.10	not at all meaning the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy or swindlers or idolaters, for then you would have to exit the world. 
1CO.5.11	But now I am writing to you not to mix together with anyone who is being called a brother if he is sexually immoral or greedy or an idolater or a slanderer or a drunkard or a swindler—not even to eat with such a fellow. 
1CO.5.12	For what business do I have judging outsiders? Don’t you judge those who are inside? 
1CO.5.13	But those who are outside, God judges. Put away the wicked fellow from among yourselves. 
1CO.6.1	Does any one of you, when he has a matter against his neighbor, dare to go to court before the unrighteous and not before the 
1CO.6.2	Don’t you know that the 
1CO.6.3	Don’t you know that we will judge angels? How much more the matters of this life! 
1CO.6.4	So if you have courts for matters of this life, why do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the community? 
1CO.6.5	I say this to put you to shame! Isn’t there even one wise man among you who will be able to settle disputes between his brethren? 
1CO.6.6	Instead, a brother goes to court against a brother—and before unbelievers at that! 
1CO.6.7	Therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you have lawsuits among yourselves. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? 
1CO.6.8	But you yourselves do wrong and cheat—and against your brothers and sisters at that!
1CO.6.9	Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived! The sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, those who practice homosexuality, 
1CO.6.10	thieves, the greedy, drunkards, slanderers, swindlers—none of these will inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	That is what some of you were—but you were washed, you were made holy, you were set right in the name of the Lord 
1CO.6.12	“Everything is permitted for me”—but not everything is helpful. “Everything is permitted for me”—but I will not be controlled by anything. 
1CO.6.13	“Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food”—but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 
1CO.6.14	Now God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power. 
1CO.6.15	Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Messiah? Shall I then take the members of Messiah and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! 
1CO.6.16	Or don’t you know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For it is said, “The two shall become one flesh.” 
1CO.6.17	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him. 
1CO.6.18	Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body—but the one committing sexual immorality sins against his own body. 
1CO.6.19	Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the 
1CO.6.20	For you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body. 
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman. 
1CO.7.2	But because of much immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	Let the husband fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have the rights to her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband does not have the rights to his own body, but the wife. 
1CO.7.5	Do not deprive one another—except by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, so that satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	But this I say as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	Yet I wish that all men were like me. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this way and another that. 
1CO.7.8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them to remain as I am. 
1CO.7.9	But if they do not have self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with desire. 
1CO.7.10	But to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—a wife is not to be separated from her husband 
1CO.7.11	(but if she gets separated, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband is not to divorce his wife. 
1CO.7.12	But to the rest I say—I, not the Lord—if any brother has a wife who is not a believer, and she agrees to live with him, he must not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And if any woman has a husband who is not a believer, and he agrees to live with her, she must not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is made holy through the wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbeliever separates, let him be separated. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases, but God has called you to 
1CO.7.16	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? 
1CO.7.17	Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, let him walk in this way. I give this rule in all of Messiah’s communities. 
1CO.7.18	Was anyone called when he already had been circumcised? Let him not make himself uncircumcised. Has anyone been called while uncircumcised? Let him not allow himself to be circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing—but keeping God’s commandments matters. 
1CO.7.20	Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called. 
1CO.7.21	Were you called as a slave? Don’t let that bother you—but if indeed you can become free, make the most of the opportunity. 
1CO.7.22	For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise the one who was called while free is Messiah’s slave. 
1CO.7.23	You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men. 
1CO.7.24	Brothers and sisters, let each one—in whatever way he was called—remain that way with God. 
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no command from the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. 
1CO.7.26	I think then, because of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek a divorce. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such people will have trouble in this fleshly life, and I am trying to spare you. 
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brothers and sisters—the time is short. From now on those who have wives should be as though they had none; 
1CO.7.30	and those who weep, as though not weeping; and those who rejoice, as though not rejoicing; and those who buy, as though not possessing; 
1CO.7.31	and those who use the world, as though not using it to the fullest. For the present form of this world is passing away. 
1CO.7.32	But I want you to be free from cares. An unmarried man cares about the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord; 
1CO.7.33	but the married man cares about the things of the world—how he may please his wife— 
1CO.7.34	and he is divided. The unmarried woman, as well as the virgin, cares about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	Now I say this for your own benefit—not to put a restraint on you, but to promote proper and constant service to the Lord without distraction. 
1CO.7.36	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if the time is ripe and it is meant to be, let him do what he decides. He does not sin. Let them marry. 
1CO.7.37	But he who stands firm in his heart—who has no pressure, but has power over his own will and has so determined in his own heart to keep her a virgin—he will do well. 
1CO.7.38	So then both he who marries the virgin does well, and he who doesn’t marry her does better. 
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is free to be married to anyone she wishes—only in the Lord. 
1CO.7.40	But in my judgment she is happier if she stays as she is—and I also think that I have the 
1CO.8.1	Now concerning idol sacrifices, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 
1CO.8.2	If anyone thinks he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know. 
1CO.8.3	But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him. 
1CO.8.4	Therefore concerning the eating of idol sacrifices, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. 
1CO.8.5	For even if there are so-called “gods,” whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”), 
1CO.8.6	yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for Him; and one Lord, 
1CO.8.7	But that knowledge is not in everyone—some, so accustomed to idols up until now, eat food as an idol sacrifice; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
1CO.8.8	But food will not bring us before God. We are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do eat. 
1CO.8.9	But watch out that this freedom of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	For suppose someone sees you—who have this knowledge—dining in an idol’s temple. If his conscience is weak, won’t he be emboldened to eat idol sacrifices? 
1CO.8.11	For the one who is weak is destroyed by your knowledge—the brother for whom Messiah died. 
1CO.8.12	In this way, when you sin against the brothers and sisters and wound their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Messiah. 
1CO.8.13	For this reason, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I do not cause my brother to stumble.
1CO.9.1	Am I not free? Am I not an emissary? Have I not seen 
1CO.9.2	If to others I am not an emissary, at least I am to you—for you are the seal of my office of emissary in the Lord. 
1CO.9.3	My defense to those who examine me is this. 
1CO.9.4	Don’t we have the right to food and drink? 
1CO.9.5	Don’t we have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other emissaries and the Lord’s brothers and Kefa? 
1CO.9.6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to not work? 
1CO.9.7	What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink its milk? 
1CO.9.8	I don’t say these things merely as a man, do I? Doesn’t 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the 
1CO.9.10	or is He speaking entirely for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because the one plowing ought to plow in hope and the one threshing in hope of a share in the crop. 
1CO.9.11	If we sowed spiritual things into you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? 
1CO.9.12	If others have a share in this claim over you, shouldn’t we even more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we put up with all things so that we cause no hindrance to the Good News of Messiah. 
1CO.9.13	Don’t you know that those who perform the holy services eat from the Temple, and those who wait on the altar receive a share at the altar? 
1CO.9.14	So also the Lord ordered those who proclaim the Good News to get their living from the Good News. 
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things, and I am not writing these things so it will happen this way in my case—for I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason to boast. 
1CO.9.16	For if I proclaim the Good News, I have no reason to boast—for pressure is put on me and woe to me if I don’t proclaim the Good News! 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have been entrusted with a commission. 
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? That when I preach, I may present the Good News free of charge, not making use of my right in the Good News. 
1CO.9.19	For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win over more of them. 
1CO.9.20	To the Jewish people I identified as a Jew, so that I might win over the Jewish people. To those under 
1CO.9.21	to those outside 
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became weak, so that I might win over the weak. I have become all things to all men, so that by all means possible I might save some. 
1CO.9.23	I do it all for the sake of the Good News, so that I might be a fellow partaker of it. 
1CO.9.24	Don’t you know that in a stadium the runners all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win! 
1CO.9.25	Every competitor exercises self-control in all respects. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we do it to receive an imperishable one. 
1CO.9.26	So I run in this way—not aimlessly. So I box in this way—not beating the air. 
1CO.9.27	Rather, I punish my body and bring it into submission, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified. 
1CO.10.1	For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea. 
1CO.10.2	They all were immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 
1CO.10.3	And all ate the same spiritual food, 
1CO.10.4	and all drank the same spiritual drink—for they were drinking from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the Rock was Messiah. 
1CO.10.5	Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the desert. 
1CO.10.6	Now these things happened as examples for us, so we wouldn’t crave evil things, just as they did. 
1CO.10.7	Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” 
1CO.10.8	And let’s not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day 23,000 fell. 
1CO.10.9	And let’s not test the Lord, as some of them did—and were destroyed by serpents. 
1CO.10.10	And let’s not grumble, as some of them did—and were destroyed by the destroying angel. 
1CO.10.11	Now these things happened to them as an example, and it was written down as a warning to us—on whom the ends of the ages have come. 
1CO.10.12	Therefore let the one who thinks that he stands watch out that he doesn’t fall. 
1CO.10.13	No temptation has taken hold of you except what is common to mankind. But God is faithful—He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can handle. But with the temptation He will also provide a way of escape, so you will be able to endure it. 
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my dearly loved ones, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I speak as to sensible people—judge for yourselves what I say. 
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing that we bless—isn’t it a sharing of Messiah’s blood? The bread which we break—isn’t it a sharing of Messiah’s body? 
1CO.10.17	Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body—for we all partake of the one bread. 
1CO.10.18	Consider physical Israel. Those who eat the sacrifices—aren’t they partners in the altar? 
1CO.10.19	What am I saying then—that an idol sacrifice is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	No, I’m saying that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God, and I don’t want you to become partners with demons. 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we? 
1CO.10.23	“Everything is permitted”—but not everything is helpful. “Everything is permitted”—but not everything builds up. 
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. 
1CO.10.25	Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, without raising questions of conscience. 
1CO.10.26	For “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.” 
1CO.10.27	If an unbeliever invites you over and you want to go, eat whatever is set before you, without raising questions of conscience. 
1CO.10.28	But if anyone says to you, “This is from an idol sacrifice,” do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— 
1CO.10.29	not your own conscience, I mean, but the other person’s. For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience? 
1CO.10.30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I give thanks for? 
1CO.10.31	Therefore, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Give no offense either to Jewish or Greek people or to God’s community— 
1CO.10.33	just as I also try to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own benefit but the benefit of many, so that they may be saved.
1CO.11.1	Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Messiah.
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firm the traditions just as I passed them on to you. 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to know that the head of every man is Messiah, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Messiah is God. 
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his head. 
1CO.11.5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same as having been shaved. 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman does not cover her head, let her cut off her hair. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her cover her head. 
1CO.11.7	For surely a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of man. 
1CO.11.8	For man is not from woman, but woman from man. 
1CO.11.9	Neither was man created for the woman’s sake, but woman for the man’s sake. 
1CO.11.10	For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. 
1CO.11.11	In any case—in the Lord—woman is not independent of man and man is not independent of woman. 
1CO.11.12	For just as the woman came from the man, so also the man comes through the woman—but all things are from God. 
1CO.11.13	Judge for yourselves—is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Doesn’t the natural order of things teach you—if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him; 
1CO.11.15	but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory, for her hair was given to her as a covering. 
1CO.11.16	But if anyone intends to be contentious, we have no such custom—nor do God’s communities. 
1CO.11.17	But in giving you this instruction I do not praise you, for when you meet together it does more harm than good. 
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when you come together as Messiah’s community, I hear that there are divisions among you; and to some extent I believe it— 
1CO.11.19	for there must be factions among you, so that those among you who are tried and true may be evident. 
1CO.11.20	Therefore, when you meet together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper— 
1CO.11.21	for each one takes his own supper beforehand, and one goes hungry while another gets drunk. 
1CO.11.22	What! It is certainly not that you do not have houses, is it? Don’t you have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise God’s community and try to humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? I don’t praise you for this! 
1CO.11.23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you—that the Lord 
1CO.11.24	and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you. Do this in memory of Me.” 
1CO.11.25	In the same way, He also took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in memory of Me.” 
1CO.11.26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes. 
1CO.11.27	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	But a man must examine himself, and then let him eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For the one who eats and drinks without recognizing the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself. 
1CO.11.30	For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and quite a few have died. 
1CO.11.31	For if we were judging ourselves thoroughly, we wouldn’t be coming under judgment. 
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, we are being disciplined by the Lord so that we might not be condemned along with the world. 
1CO.11.33	So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. 
1CO.11.34	If anyone is hungry let him eat at home, so that when you meet it doesn’t lead to judgment. And the rest I will put in order when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be ignorant. 
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed by idols that cannot speak, and you got led astray. 
1CO.12.3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the 
1CO.12.4	Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same 
1CO.12.5	There are various kinds of service, but the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	There are various kinds of working, but the same God who works all things in all people. 
1CO.12.7	But to each person is given the manifestation of the 
1CO.12.8	For to one is given through the 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same 
1CO.12.10	to another workings of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 
1CO.12.11	But one and the same 
1CO.12.12	For just as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of the body—though many—are one body, so also is Messiah. 
1CO.12.13	For in one 
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one part, but many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot says, “Since I’m not a hand, I’m not part of the body,” is it therefore not part of the body? 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear says, “Since I’m not an eye, I’m not part of the body,” is it for this reason any less part of the body? 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 
1CO.12.18	But now God has placed the parts—each one of them—in the body just as He desired. 
1CO.12.19	If they were all one part, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	But now there are many parts, yet one body. 
1CO.12.21	The eye cannot tell the hand, “I don’t need you!” or in turn the head to the feet, “I don’t need you!” 
1CO.12.22	On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be less important are indispensable. 
1CO.12.23	Those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we clothe with greater honor; and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty; 
1CO.12.24	but our presentable parts have no such need. Rather God assembled the body, giving more honor to those who are lacking, 
1CO.12.25	so that there may be no division in the body, but so that the parts may have the same care for one another. 
1CO.12.26	If one part suffers, all the parts suffer together. If one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together. 
1CO.12.27	Now you are the body of Messiah, and members individually. 
1CO.12.28	God has put into His community first emissaries, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then healings, helps, leadership, various kinds of tongues. 
1CO.12.29	All are not emissaries, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All do not work miracles, do they? 
1CO.12.30	All do not have gifts of healing, do they? All do not speak in tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? 
1CO.12.31	But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And still I show you a far better way: 
1CO.13.1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love, I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	If I give away all that I own and if I hand over my body so I might boast but have not love, I gain nothing. 
1CO.13.4	Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not brag, it is not puffed up, 
1CO.13.5	it does not behave inappropriately, it does not seek its own way, it is not provoked, it keeps no account of wrong, 
1CO.13.6	it does not rejoice over injustice but rejoices in the truth; 
1CO.13.7	it bears all things, it believes all things, it hopes all things, it endures all things. 
1CO.13.8	Love never fails— but where there are prophecies, they will pass away; where there are tongues, they will cease; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part; 
1CO.13.10	but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is partial will pass away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put away childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. 
1CO.13.13	But now these three remain— faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. 
1CO.14.2	For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to people but to God—for no one understands, but in the 
1CO.14.3	But one who prophesies speaks to people for building up, urging on, and uplifting. 
1CO.14.4	One who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but one who prophesies builds up the community. 
1CO.14.5	Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. One who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues—unless he interprets, so that the community may be built up. 
1CO.14.6	But now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you—unless I speak to you by way of revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? 
1CO.14.7	It is the same for lifeless things that make a sound—like a flute or a harp. If they make no distinction in the tones, how will what is played be recognized? 
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for battle? 
1CO.14.9	So also with you with your tongue—unless you utter speech that is intelligible, how will what is spoken be understood? For you will be talking to the wind! 
1CO.14.10	It may be that there are many kinds of languages in the world—and none without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	If then I do not understand the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	Likewise with you—since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, keep trying to excel for the building up of the community. 
1CO.14.13	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 
1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray in my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praises with my spirit, and I will also sing praises with my mind. 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise if you give thanks and praise in the spirit, how will one filling the place of the ungifted say the “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he has no idea what you’re saying? 
1CO.14.17	For you certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up. 
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 
1CO.14.19	However, in Messiah’s community I would rather speak five words with my mind, so I may also instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue. 
1CO.14.20	Brothers and sisters, stop being children in your thinking—rather, be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. 
1CO.14.21	In the Prophets it is written, “By those with strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. And not even then will they listen to me,” says 
1CO.14.22	Therefore tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers—but prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1CO.14.23	So if Messiah’s whole community comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and uninstructed or unbelieving people come in, won’t they say that you are crazy? 
1CO.14.24	But if all are prophesying and some unbelieving or ungifted person comes in, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all. 
1CO.14.25	The secrets of his heart become known, and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring, “God really is among you!” 
1CO.14.26	What is it then, brothers and sisters? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. 
1CO.14.27	If someone speaks in a tongue, let it be by two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret. 
1CO.14.28	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the community but speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others evaluate. 
1CO.14.30	But if something is revealed to another sitting nearby, let the first one become silent. 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy one by one, so all may learn and be encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets, 
1CO.14.33	for God is not a God of confusion, but 
1CO.14.34	let women keep silent in the communities, for it is not permitted for them to speak out. Rather let them be in order, as the 
1CO.14.35	If they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home—for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak out in the community. 
1CO.14.36	Did the word of God originate with you? Or did it reach you alone? 
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s command. 
1CO.14.38	But if someone does not recognize it, he is not recognized. 
1CO.14.39	Therefore, brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 
1CO.14.40	But let everything be done decently and in order. 
1CO.15.1	Now I make known to you, brothers and sisters, the Good News which I proclaimed to you. You also received it, and you took your stand on it, 
1CO.15.2	and by it you are being saved if you hold firm to the word I proclaimed to you—unless you believed without proper consideration. 
1CO.15.3	For I also passed on to you first of all what I also received— that Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
1CO.15.4	that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 
1CO.15.5	and that He appeared to Kefa, then to the Twelve. 
1CO.15.6	Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time— most of them are still alive, though some have died. 
1CO.15.7	Then He appeared to Jacob, then to all the emissaries, 
1CO.15.8	and last of all, as to one untimely born, He also appeared to me. 
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the emissaries, unworthy to be called an emissary because I persecuted God’s community. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace toward me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than them all—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. 
1CO.15.11	Whether then it is I or they, so we proclaim, and so you believed. 
1CO.15.12	Now if Messiah is proclaimed—that He has been raised from the dead—how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Messiah has been raised! 
1CO.15.14	And if Messiah has not been raised, then our proclaiming is meaningless and your faith also is meaningless. 
1CO.15.15	Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that He raised up Messiah—whom He did not raise up, if in fact the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, not even Messiah has been raised. 
1CO.15.17	And if Messiah has not been raised, your faith is futile—you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Messiah have perished. 
1CO.15.19	If we have hoped in Messiah in this life alone, we are to be pitied more than all people. 
1CO.15.20	But now Messiah has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.21	For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also has come through a Man. 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Messiah will all be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But each in its own order: Messiah the firstfruits; then, at His coming, those who belong to Messiah; 
1CO.15.24	then the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all rule and all authority and power. 
1CO.15.25	For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
1CO.15.27	For God has “put all things in subjection underneath His feet.” But when the psalmist says that “all” has been put in subjection, it is clear that this does not include God Himself, who put all things under Messiah. 
1CO.15.28	Now when all things become subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also become subject to the One who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all. 
1CO.15.29	Otherwise, what will they do who are immersed for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are they immersed for them? 
1CO.15.30	And why are we in danger every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I die every day—yes, as surely as the boast in you, brothers and sisters, which I have in Messiah 
1CO.15.32	If, for human reasons, I fought with “wild animals” at Ephesus, what good is that to me? If the dead are not raised, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” 
1CO.15.33	Do not be deceived! “Bad company corrupts good morals.” 
1CO.15.34	Come to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning! For some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame. 
1CO.15.35	But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?” 
1CO.15.36	Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
1CO.15.37	As for what you sow—you are not sowing the body that will be, but a bare seed, maybe of wheat or something else. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body just as He planned, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. 
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of humans, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish. 
1CO.15.40	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one thing while the earthly is another. 
1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory. 
1CO.15.42	So also is the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption! 
1CO.15.43	Sown in dishonor, raised in glory! Sown in weakness, raised in power! 
1CO.15.44	Sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body! If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 
1CO.15.46	However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man is of the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	Like the one made of dust, so also are those made of dust; and like the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly. 
1CO.15.49	And just as we have borne the image of the one made from dust, so also shall we bear the image of the One from heaven. 
1CO.15.50	Now I say this, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay. 
1CO.15.51	Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last 
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruptibility , and this mortal must put on immortality. 
1CO.15.54	But when this corruptible will have put on incorruptibility and this mortal will have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” 
1CO.15.55	“Where, O Death, is your victory? Where, O Death, is your sting?” 
1CO.15.56	Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the 
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God, who keeps giving us the victory through our Lord 
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my dearly loved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord—because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. 
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of the week, let each of you set something aside, saving up whatever is gained, so no collections take place when I come. 
1CO.16.3	Then whenever I arrive, I will send whomever you approve with letters of introduction to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 
1CO.16.4	If it is advisable for me to go also, they will go with me. 
1CO.16.5	But I will come to you after I have passed through Macedonia—for I am passing through Macedonia. 
1CO.16.6	Perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey—wherever I go. 
1CO.16.7	For I do not wish to see you now just in passing—for I hope to stay on with you for a while, if the Lord permits. 
1CO.16.8	But I will stay on at Ephesus until 
1CO.16.9	for a great door has opened wide for me, though many are in opposition. 
1CO.16.10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you—for he is doing the Lord’s work, just as I am. 
1CO.16.11	No one, then, should treat him with disrespect. But set him on his way in 
1CO.16.12	Now about our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers and sisters, and he was quite unwilling to come now—but he will come when he has an opportunity. 
1CO.16.13	Be on the alert! Stand firm in the faith! Be men of courage! Be strong! 
1CO.16.14	Let all that you do be done in love. 
1CO.16.15	Now I urge you, brothers and sisters (you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves in service to the 
1CO.16.16	also to submit to people such as these, and to everyone working together and laboring. 
1CO.16.17	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, for they made up for your absence. 
1CO.16.18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men. 
1CO.16.19	Messiah’s communities in Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, with the community that meets in their house. 
1CO.16.20	All the brothers and sisters greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
1CO.16.21	This greeting is in my own hand—Paul’s. 
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be cursed. Marana, tha! Our Lord, come! 
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord 
1CO.16.24	My love be with you all in Messiah 
2CO.1.1	Paul, an emissary of Messiah 
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and 
2CO.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord 
2CO.1.4	He encourages us in every trouble, so that we may be able to encourage those who are in any trouble, through the very encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God. 
2CO.1.5	For just as the sufferings of Messiah overflow into us, so also through Messiah our encouragement overflows. 
2CO.1.6	If we are suffering hardship, it is for your encouragement and salvation. Or if we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement, which produces in you the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer. 
2CO.1.7	Our hope for you is firm, since we know that as you are partners in our sufferings, so also in our encouragement. 
2CO.1.8	For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of our trouble that happened in Asia. We were under great pressure—so far beyond our strength that we despaired even of living. 
2CO.1.9	In fact, we had within ourselves the death sentence—so that we might not rely on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead. 
2CO.1.10	He who rescued us from so great a danger of death will continue to rescue us—we have set our hope on Him that He will rescue us again. 
2CO.1.11	You also are helping by your prayer for us, so that from many people thanks may be given on our behalf for the gracious gift given us through the help of many. 
2CO.1.12	For our reason for boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world, and most especially toward you, with simplicity and godly sincerity—not by human wisdom but by the grace of God. 
2CO.1.13	For we write nothing to you other than what you can read and understand—and I hope you will understand in full 
2CO.1.14	just as you understood us in part, so that we are your reason for boasting just as you also are ours in the Day of our Lord 
2CO.1.15	Because of this confidence, I was planning to come to you first, so that you might have a second benefit— 
2CO.1.16	to pass by you on my way to Macedonia and again from Macedonia to come back to you, and to be helped by you on my journey to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	So when I was planning to do this, I didn’t do so lightly, did I? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh—so it might be with me “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time? 
2CO.1.18	But as God is faithful, our message to you is not both “Yes” and “No.” 
2CO.1.19	For 
2CO.1.20	For in Him all the promises of God are “Yes.” Therefore also through Him is the “Amen” by us, to the glory of God. 
2CO.1.21	Now it is God who establishes us with you in Messiah. He anointed us, 
2CO.1.22	set His seal on us, and gave us the 
2CO.1.23	But I call God as my witness—to spare you, I didn’t come to Corinth again. 
2CO.1.24	Not that we lord it over you in matters of faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy—for in the faith you are standing firm.
2CO.2.1	So I made up my mind that I would not come to you again causing sorrow. 
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you sorrow, then who is there cheering me on but the one I have made sorrowful? 
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this very thing to you, so that when I came I wouldn’t have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice—having confidence in you all that my joy is yours. 
2CO.2.4	For out of much distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears—not to make you sorrowful, but to let you know the love that I have especially for you. 
2CO.2.5	But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but to some extent—not to exaggerate—to all of you. 
2CO.2.6	For such a person, this punishment by the majority is enough. 
2CO.2.7	So instead you should forgive him and encourage him. Otherwise such a person might be swallowed up by excessive sorrow. 
2CO.2.8	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him. 
2CO.2.9	For to this end I also wrote, that I might know your character, whether you are obedient in all things. 
2CO.2.10	Now anyone you forgive, I also forgive. For indeed, what I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything), I did it for you in the presence of Messiah, 
2CO.2.11	so that we might not be outwitted by satan—for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
2CO.2.12	Now when I arrived in Troas for the Good News of Messiah, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, 
2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus my brother. So I said farewell to them, and I set out for Macedonia. 
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who in Messiah always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us reveals everywhere the aroma of the knowledge of Himself. 
2CO.2.15	For we are the aroma of Messiah to God, among those who are being saved and those who are perishing— 
2CO.2.16	to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. Who is competent for these things? 
2CO.2.17	For we are not like many, peddling the word of God. Rather, in Messiah we speak in the sight of God with sincerity, as persons sent from God. 
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you? 
2CO.3.2	You are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. 
2CO.3.3	It is clear that you are a letter from Messiah delivered by us—written not with ink but with the 
2CO.3.4	Such is the confidence we have through Messiah toward God— 
2CO.3.5	not that we are competent in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our competence is from God. 
2CO.3.6	He also made us competent as servants of a new covenant—not of the letter, but of the 
2CO.3.7	Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that 
2CO.3.8	how will the ministry of the 
2CO.3.9	For if there is glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness overflows even more in glory. 
2CO.3.10	For even what was glorious is not glorious in comparison to the glory that surpasses it. 
2CO.3.11	For if what is passing away is glorious, much more what remains is glorious. 
2CO.3.12	Therefore, having such a hope, we act with great boldness. 
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face in order for 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were hardened. For up to this very day the same veil remains unlifted at the reading of the ancient covenant, since in Messiah it is passing away. 
2CO.3.15	But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart. 
2CO.3.16	But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the 
2CO.3.18	But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory—just as from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
2CO.4.1	For this reason, since we have this ministry, just as we received mercy, we do not lose heart. 
2CO.4.2	Instead, we renounced the hidden shameful ways—not walking in deception or distorting the word of God, but commending ourselves before God to everyone’s conscience by the open proclamation of the truth. 
2CO.4.3	And even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 
2CO.4.4	In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so they might not see the light of the Good News of the glory of Messiah, who is the image of God. 
2CO.4.5	For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Messiah 
2CO.4.6	For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Messiah. 
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that the surpassing greatness of the power may be from God and not from ourselves. 
2CO.4.8	We are hard pressed in every way, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not in despair; 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed; 
2CO.4.10	always carrying in the body the death of 
2CO.4.11	For we who live are always being handed over to death for 
2CO.4.12	So death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. 
2CO.4.13	But we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed, and therefore I spoke.” So we also believe, and therefore we also speak, 
2CO.4.14	knowing that the One who raised the Lord 
2CO.4.15	For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace that is spreading through more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow—to the glory of God. 
2CO.4.16	Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. 
2CO.4.17	For our trouble, light and momentary, is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, 
2CO.4.18	as we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen. For what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal. 
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the tent, our earthly home, is torn down, we have a building from God—a home not made with human hands, eternal in the heavens. 
2CO.5.2	For in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling— 
2CO.5.3	if indeed, after we have put it on, we will not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For we groan while we are in this tent—burdened because we don’t want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 
2CO.5.5	Now the One who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the 
2CO.5.6	Therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. 
2CO.5.7	For we walk by faith, not by sight. 
2CO.5.8	We are confident, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	So whether at home or absent, we make it our aim to be pleasing to Him. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Messiah, so that each one may receive what is due for the things he did while in the body—whether good or bad. 
2CO.5.11	Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we are trying to persuade people, but what we are is known to God—and I hope it is known to your consciences as well. 
2CO.5.12	For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity for boasting about us, so that you may have something to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart. 
2CO.5.13	For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Messiah compels us, since we have concluded that One died for all; as a result all died. 
2CO.5.15	And He died for all so that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for the One who died for them and was raised. 
2CO.5.16	So from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Messiah according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know Him this way. 
2CO.5.17	Therefore if anyone is in Messiah, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 
2CO.5.18	Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Messiah and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.19	That is, in Messiah God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them; and He has entrusted the message of reconciliation to us. 
2CO.5.20	We are therefore ambassadors for Messiah, as though God were making His appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of Messiah, be reconciled to God. 
2CO.5.21	He made the One who knew no sin to become a sin offering on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.
2CO.6.1	Since we are co-laboring, we also urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. 
2CO.6.2	For He says, “At a favorable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 
2CO.6.3	We give no cause for offense in anything, so that our ministry may not be blamed. 
2CO.6.4	But as God’s servants, we are commending ourselves in every way—in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 
2CO.6.5	in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in troubles, in sleeplessness, in hunger; 
2CO.6.6	in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the 
2CO.6.7	in truthful speech, in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 
2CO.6.8	through honor and dishonor, through evil report and good report. We are regarded as deceivers and yet true; 
2CO.6.9	as unknown and yet well-known; as dying, yet behold, we live; as disciplined yet not put to death; 
2CO.6.10	as grieving yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing yet possessing everything. 
2CO.6.11	We have spoken openly to you, O Corinthians; our heart is open wide! 
2CO.6.12	You are not restricted by us, yet you are restricted in your own feelings. 
2CO.6.13	Now in return—I speak as to my children—open wide to us also. 
2CO.6.14	Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	What harmony does Messiah have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	What agreement does God’s Temple have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God—just as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 
2CO.6.17	Therefore, come out from among them, and be separate, says 
2CO.6.18	I will be a father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says 
2CO.7.1	Therefore, since we have these promises, loved ones, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	Make room for us in your hearts. We wronged no one, ruined no one, took advantage of no one. 
2CO.7.3	I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts—to die together and to live together with you. 
2CO.7.4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I have been filled with encouragement. I overflow with joy in all our troubles. 
2CO.7.5	For even when we came into Macedonia, our body had no rest. But we were hard pressed on every side—conflicts outside, fears within. 
2CO.7.6	But God, who encourages the downcast, encouraged us with the arrival of Titus; 
2CO.7.7	and not only by his coming, but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your deep concern for me—so that I rejoiced still more. 
2CO.7.8	For even if I grieved you with my letter, I do not regret it—though I did regret it, for I see that my letter grieved you, but just for a while. 
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to the point of repentance. For you were grieved according to God’s will, so that you might in no way suffer loss from us. 
2CO.7.10	For the grief that God wills brings a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret. But the world’s grief brings death. 
2CO.7.11	For see what this very thing—this grieving that God wills—has brought you! What diligence, what defense, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what rendering of justice! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. 
2CO.7.12	So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for the sake of the wrongdoer or for the sake of the one who was wronged, but to make known to you your diligence for us in the sight of God. 
2CO.7.13	For this reason we have been encouraged. Besides our own encouragement, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. 
2CO.7.14	For if I have boasted some to him about you, I was not put to shame. But as we spoke all things truthfully to you, so also our boasting to Titus has proved to be the truth. 
2CO.7.15	His feelings toward you overflow when he remembers everyone’s obedience—how you received him with fear and trembling. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	Now we make known to you, brothers and sisters, the grace God has given to Messiah’s communities in Macedonia— 
2CO.8.2	that in much testing by affliction, the abundance of their joy and their extreme poverty overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. 
2CO.8.3	For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own free will— 
2CO.8.4	begging us with much urging for the favor of sharing in the relief of the 
2CO.8.5	Moreover, it was not just as we had hoped, but they gave of themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God’s will. 
2CO.8.6	So we urged Titus that, just as he had made a start before, so he should also complete this gracious service for you. 
2CO.8.7	But as you excel in everything—in faith and speech and knowledge and all diligence, and in your love for us—also excel in this grace. 
2CO.8.8	I am saying this not as a command, but I am trying to prove by the diligence of others the genuineness of your love as well. 
2CO.8.9	For you know the grace of our Lord 
2CO.8.10	Now I give my opinion in this matter, that it is a credit to you that a year ago you were the first to start—not only to do but even to be willing. 
2CO.8.11	But now finish doing it, so that just as there was eagerness to be willing, so also to finish it, out of what you have. 
2CO.8.12	For if the eagerness is present, the gift is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he doesn’t have. 
2CO.8.13	For it is not relief for others and hardship for you, but as a matter of equality. 
2CO.8.14	Your abundance at this present time meets their need, so that their abundance may also meet your need—so that there may be equality. 
2CO.8.15	As it is written, “He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.”
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same devotion for you. 
2CO.8.17	For indeed he not only accepted our appeal, but went to you with eagerness and on his own initiative. 
2CO.8.18	We are sending along with him the brother whose fame in connection with the Good News has spread throughout all of Messiah’s communities. 
2CO.8.19	Not only that, but he has also been appointed by the communities as our travel companion with this gracious gift, which is administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself and to show our eagerness to help. 
2CO.8.20	We are taking this precaution, so that no one will blame us in regard to the way we administer this generous gift. 
2CO.8.21	We have regard for what is honorable—not only before the Lord, but also before people. 
2CO.8.22	Also with them we are sending our brother whom we have tested many times and found to be diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are the emissaries of the communities, a glory to Messiah. 
2CO.8.24	Therefore, before Messiah’s communities show them the proof of your love and of our boasting about you. 
2CO.9.1	Now about this service to the 
2CO.9.2	for I know your eagerness. I boast about it to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been preparing for a year already; and your zeal has stirred up most of them. 
2CO.9.3	But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you may not be in vain in this case, so that you may be prepared, just as I kept saying. 
2CO.9.4	Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be put to shame in this undertaking. 
2CO.9.5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on to you and arrange ahead of time your generous gift that had been promised beforehand, so that it would be ready as a gift and not as an extortion. 
2CO.9.6	The point is this: whoever sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully. 
2CO.9.7	Let each one give as he has decided in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion—for God loves a cheerful giver. 
2CO.9.8	And God is able to make all grace overflow to you, so that by always having enough of everything, you may overflow in every good work. 
2CO.9.9	As it is written, “He scattered widely, He gave to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.” 
2CO.9.10	Now the One who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness. 
2CO.9.11	You will be enriched in everything for all generosity, which through us brings about thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.12	For this service of giving is not only supplying the needs of the 
2CO.9.13	Because of the evidence of this service, they praise God for the obedience of your affirmation of the Good News of Messiah and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to everyone. 
2CO.9.14	And in their prayer for you, they long for you because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
2CO.10.1	Now I, Paul, appeal myself to you by the meekness and gentleness of Messiah—I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when far away. 
2CO.10.2	I beg of you that when I am present I won’t need to be bold with the courage I consider showing against some who judge us as walking in the flesh. 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh. 
2CO.10.4	For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful through God for the tearing down of strongholds. We are tearing down false arguments 
2CO.10.5	and every high-minded thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God. We are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Messiah— 
2CO.10.6	ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete. 
2CO.10.7	Look at what is before your eyes. If anyone is confident in himself that he belongs to Messiah, let him reconsider that just as he belongs to Messiah, so also do we. 
2CO.10.8	For even if I boast a little more about our authority—which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down—I will not be put to shame. 
2CO.10.9	Not that I would try to terrify you by my letters— 
2CO.10.10	for they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his presence in person is weak and his speech of no account.” 
2CO.10.11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word through letters when we are absent, we also are in action when we are present. 
2CO.10.12	For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they have no understanding. 
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast beyond limits, but within the limits of the area that God has assigned to us—to reach even as far as you. 
2CO.10.14	We are not extending ourselves too far, as if we did not reach you—for we did come even as far as to you with the Good News of Messiah. 
2CO.10.15	Neither are we boasting beyond limits based on the labors of others, but we have hope while your faith is growing for our area among you to be greatly enlarged— 
2CO.10.16	so that we may proclaim the Good News even to regions beyond you, not boasting about what has been accomplished in another’s area. 
2CO.10.17	But “let him who boasts boast in the Lord.” 
2CO.10.18	For it Is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. 
2CO.11.1	I wish that you would put up with a little foolishness from me, but indeed you are putting up with me. 
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I betrothed you to one husband, to present you to Messiah as a pure virgin. 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds might be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion and purity to the Messiah. 
2CO.11.4	For if someone comes and proclaims another 
2CO.11.5	For I consider myself in no way inferior to the “super special” emissaries. 
2CO.11.6	Even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not so in knowledge. No, in every way we have made this clear to you in all things. 
2CO.11.7	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed to you God’s Good News free of charge? 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other communities by taking wages from them for service to you. 
2CO.11.9	When I was present with you and I was in need, I did not burden anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. In everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do so. 
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Messiah is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. 
2CO.11.11	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! 
2CO.11.12	But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off the opportunity from those who want an opportunity in what they boast about to also be regarded just as we are. 
2CO.11.13	For such men are false emissaries, deceitful workers masquerading as Messiah’s emissaries. 
2CO.11.14	And no wonder, for even satan masquerades as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds. 
2CO.11.16	I say again, let no one consider me to be a fool. But if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I also may boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	What I am saying, I am saying not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this self-confident boasting. 
2CO.11.18	Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. 
2CO.11.19	For you, being so wise, put up with fools gladly. 
2CO.11.20	For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone puts on airs, if someone slaps you on the face. 
2CO.11.21	To my shame I must say that we have been weak. Yet whatever anyone else dares to boast about—I speak in foolishness—I dare, too. 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of Messiah? I am more so—I speak like I’m out of my mind—in labors much more, in prisons much more, in beatings more brutal, near death often. 
2CO.11.24	Five times from the Jewish leaders I received forty lashes minus one. 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. A night and a day I spent in the open sea. 
2CO.11.26	In my many journeys I have been in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the desert, dangers in the sea, dangers among false brothers, 
2CO.11.27	in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. 
2CO.11.28	Besides these other things, there is daily pressure on me of concern for all of Messiah’s communities. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with indignation? 
2CO.11.30	If I must boast, I will boast of my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord 
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me, 
2CO.11.33	and I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands. 
2CO.12.1	I must go on boasting—though it does no good, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Messiah (whether in the body I don’t know, or whether out of the body I don’t know—God knows)—fourteen years ago, he was caught up to the third heaven. 
2CO.12.3	I know such a man (whether in the body or outside of the body I don’t know—God knows)— 
2CO.12.4	he was caught up into Paradise and heard words too sacred to tell, which a human is not permitted to utter. 
2CO.12.5	On behalf of such a man I will boast—but about myself I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	For if I should want to boast, I would not be foolish—for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no one may think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me— 
2CO.12.7	even in the extraordinary quality of the revelations. So that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me—a a messenger of satan to torment me, so I would not exalt myself. 
2CO.12.8	I pleaded with the Lord three times about this, that it might leave me. 
2CO.12.9	But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of Messiah may dwell in me. 
2CO.12.10	For Messiah’s sake, then, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in distresses, in persecutions, in calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 
2CO.12.11	I have become a fool—you drove me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I am in no way inferior to the super-special emissaries—though I am nothing. 
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of an emissary were worked out among you, with patient endurance, by signs and wonders and mighty miracles. 
2CO.12.13	For in what respect were you treated worse than the rest of Messiah’s communities—except that I myself did not burden you? Pardon me this injustice! 
2CO.12.14	Look, I am ready to come to you this third time, and I will not burden you—for I seek not your possessions, but you! For the children are not obliged to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
2CO.12.15	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? 
2CO.12.16	But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself. Nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you with trickery! 
2CO.12.17	I haven’t taken advantage of you through any of those I sent to you, have I? 
2CO.12.18	I did urge Titus to visit you, and I sent the brother with him. Titus didn’t take any advantage of you, did he? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit, in the same footsteps? 
2CO.12.19	All along you’ve been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. It is before God that we’ve been speaking in Messiah—and all for building you up, loved ones. 
2CO.12.20	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come, I may find you not as I wish, or I may be found by you not as you wish—that there may be strife, envy, outbursts of anger, self-seeking disputes, 
2CO.12.21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I will mourn for many of those who have sinned before and not repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and indecency which they committed.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am coming to you. “By the testimony of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.” 
2CO.13.2	I spoke a warning, when I was with you the second time. Though now I am away, I am again speaking a warning to those who have sinned before, as well as to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare anyone— 
2CO.13.3	since you are demanding proof that Messiah is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you, but powerful among you. 
2CO.13.4	For He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we shall live with Him by God’s power toward you. 
2CO.13.5	Test yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Examine yourselves! Or don’t you know yourselves—that Messiah 
2CO.13.6	But I hope that you will realize that we haven’t failed the test. 
2CO.13.7	Now we pray to God that you do no wrong—not so that we may appear to have passed the test, but in order that you may do what is right even if we may seem to have failed. 
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray for this—your perfecting. 
2CO.13.10	For this reason I write these things while I am absent, so that when I am present I need not proceed harshly, according to the authority which the Lord gave me—for building up and not for tearing down.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Aim for restoration, encourage one another, be of the same mind, live in 
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the 
2CO.13.13	The grace of the Lord 
GAL.1.1	Paul, an emissary (sent not from men or by man, but by 
GAL.1.2	and all the brothers with me. To Messiah’s communities of Galatia: 
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and 
GAL.1.4	who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father— 
GAL.1.5	to Him be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
GAL.1.6	I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from the One who called you by the grace of Messiah, to a different “good news”— 
GAL.1.7	not that there is another, but only some who are confusing you and want to distort the Good News of Messiah. 
GAL.1.8	But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should announce any “good news” to you other than what we have proclaimed to you, let that person be cursed! 
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, so I now repeat: if anyone proclaims to you “good news” other than what you received, let that person be under a curse! 
GAL.1.10	Am I now trying to win people’s approval, or God’s? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Messiah. 
GAL.1.11	Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the Good News proclaimed by me is not man-made. 
GAL.1.12	I did not receive it from any human, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of 
GAL.1.13	For you have heard of my earlier behavior in Judaism—how I persecuted God’s community beyond measure and tried to destroy it. 
GAL.1.14	I was even advancing within Judaism beyond many my own age among my people, being a more extreme observer of my fathers’ traditions. 
GAL.1.15	But when God—who set me apart from birth and called me through His grace—was pleased 
GAL.1.16	to reveal His Son to me so I would proclaim Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with any human. 
GAL.1.17	I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who were emissaries before me, either. Instead I went away to Arabia and returned again to Damascus. 
GAL.1.18	Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to visit with Peter, and I stayed with him fifteen days. 
GAL.1.19	But I saw no other emissaries except Jacob, the Lord’s brother. 
GAL.1.20	(In what I’m writing you, before God, I do not lie.) 
GAL.1.21	Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	But I was personally unknown to Messiah’s communities of Judea; 
GAL.1.23	they only kept hearing, “The one who once persecuted us now proclaims the Good News he once tried to destroy!” 
GAL.1.24	So they were praising God because of me.
GAL.2.1	Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me. 
GAL.2.2	Because of a revelation, I went up and presented to them the Good News that I proclaim among the Gentiles. But I did so privately to those who seemed to be influential, to make sure I would not run—or had not run—in vain. 
GAL.2.3	Yet not even Titus who was with me, a Greek, was forced to be circumcised. 
GAL.2.4	Now this issue came up because of false brothers secretly brought in (who slipped in to spy out our freedom in Messiah, in order to bring us into bondage). 
GAL.2.5	But we did not give in to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the Good News might be preserved for you. 
GAL.2.6	But from those who seemed to be influential (whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—well, those influential ones added nothing to my message. 
GAL.2.7	On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised just as Peter was for the circumcised. 
GAL.2.8	(For the same God who was at work in Peter as an emissary to the Jews, also was at work in me as an emissary to the Gentiles.) 
GAL.2.9	Realizing the favor that had been given to me, Jacob and Peter and John—who are the recognized pillars—shook hands in partnership with Barnabas and me, so that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews. 
GAL.2.10	They asked only that we remember the poor—something I also was eager to do.
GAL.2.11	But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong— 
GAL.2.12	for before certain people came from Jacob, he regularly ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and separate himself, fearing those from the circumcision. 
GAL.2.13	And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter in front of everyone, “If you—being a Jew—live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?” 
GAL.2.15	We are Jews by birth and not sinners from among the Gentiles. 
GAL.2.16	Yet we know that a person is set right not by deeds based on 
GAL.2.17	But if, while seeking to be justified in Messiah, we ourselves also were found to be sinners, is Messiah then an agent of sin? May it never be! 
GAL.2.18	For if I rebuild the very things I tore down, I prove myself to be a law-breaker. 
GAL.2.19	For through law I died to law, so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Messiah; 
GAL.2.20	and it is no longer I who live, but Messiah lives in me. And the life I now live in the body, I live by trusting in 
GAL.2.21	I do not nullify the grace of God—for if righteousness comes through 
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who cast a spell on you? Before your eyes 
GAL.3.2	I want to find out just one thing from you: did you receive the 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? After beginning with the 
GAL.3.4	Did you endure so much for nothing—if it really was for nothing? 
GAL.3.5	So then, the One who gives you the 
GAL.3.6	Just as Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” 
GAL.3.7	know then that those who have faith are children of Abraham. 
GAL.3.8	The Scriptures, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the Good News to Abraham in advance, saying, “All the nations shall be blessed through you.” 
GAL.3.9	So then, the faithful are blessed along with Abraham, the faithful one. 
GAL.3.10	For all who rely on the deeds of 
GAL.3.11	It is clear that no one is set right before God by 
GAL.3.12	However, 
GAL.3.13	Messiah liberated us from 
GAL.3.14	in order that through Messiah 
GAL.3.15	Brothers and sisters, I speak in human terms: even with a man’s covenant, once it has been confirmed, no one cancels it or adds to it. 
GAL.3.16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It doesn’t say, “and to seeds,” as of many, but as of one, “and to your seed,” who is the Messiah. 
GAL.3.17	What I am saying is this: 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise. But God has graciously given it to Abraham by means of a promise. 
GAL.3.19	Then why the 
GAL.3.20	Now an intermediary is not for one party alone—but God is one. 
GAL.3.21	Then is the 
GAL.3.22	But the Scripture has locked up the whole world under sin, so that the promise based on trust in Messiah 
GAL.3.23	Now before faith came, we were being guarded under 
GAL.3.24	Therefore the 
GAL.3.25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. 
GAL.3.26	For you are all sons of God through trusting in Messiah 
GAL.3.27	For all of you who were immersed in Messiah have clothed yourselves with Messiah. 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female—for you are all one in Messiah 
GAL.3.29	And if you belong to Messiah, then you are Abraham’s seed—heirs according to the promise.
GAL.4.1	Now I am saying, so long as the heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, even though he is the owner of everything. 
GAL.4.2	Instead, he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father. 
GAL.4.3	So also, when we were underage, we were subservient to the basic principles of the world. 
GAL.4.4	But when the fullness of time came, God sent out His Son, born of a woman and born under law— 
GAL.4.5	to free those under law, so we might receive adoption as sons. 
GAL.4.6	Now because you are sons, God sent the 
GAL.4.7	So you are no longer a slave but a son—and if a son, also an heir through God. 
GAL.4.8	But at that time, when you did not know God, you served those who by nature are not gods at all. 
GAL.4.9	But now you have come to know God—or rather you have come to be known by God. So how can you turn back again to those weak and worthless principles? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again? 
GAL.4.10	You observe days and months and seasons and years. 
GAL.4.11	I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain! 
GAL.4.12	I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong— 
GAL.4.13	you know it was because of a physical ailment that I proclaimed the Good News to you the first time; 
GAL.4.14	and though my physical condition was a trial to you, you did not hate or reject me. No, you welcomed me as a messenger of God—or even as Messiah 
GAL.4.15	So where is your sense of joy? For I testify that you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me, if possible. 
GAL.4.16	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?! 
GAL.4.17	Others zealously court you—not in a good way, but they wish to shut you out so that you will court them. 
GAL.4.18	To be courted is good, but let it always be in a good way—and not just when I am there with you. 
GAL.4.19	My dear children! Again I suffer labor pains until Messiah is formed in you. 
GAL.4.20	I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, for I don’t know what to make of you. 
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who want to be under 
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman. 
GAL.4.23	But one—the son by the slave woman—was born naturally; while the other—the son by the free woman—was through the promise. 
GAL.4.24	Now these things are being treated allegorically, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, giving birth to slavery—this is Hagar. 
GAL.4.25	But this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem above is free—she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren woman who bears no children. Break forth and shout, you who suffer no labor pains. For more are the children of the desolate than of the one who has a husband.” 
GAL.4.28	Now you, brothers and sisters—like Isaac, you are children of promise. 
GAL.4.29	But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the 
GAL.4.30	But what does the Scripture say? “Drive out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son” of the free woman. 
GAL.4.31	So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	For freedom, Messiah set us free—so stand firm, and do not be burdened by a yoke of slavery again. 
GAL.5.2	Listen—I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Messiah will be of no benefit to you. 
GAL.5.3	Again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised, that he is obligated to keep the whole 
GAL.5.4	You who are trying to be justified by 
GAL.5.5	For through the 
GAL.5.6	For in Messiah 
GAL.5.7	You were running a great race! Who blocked you from following the truth? 
GAL.5.8	This detour doesn’t come from the One who calls you. 
GAL.5.9	A little 
GAL.5.10	I am confident in the Lord that you will not think otherwise. But the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty, whoever he is. 
GAL.5.11	As for me, brothers and sisters, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the stumbling block of the cross has been eliminated. 
GAL.5.12	I only wish those who are agitating you would castrate themselves! 
GAL.5.13	Brothers and sisters, you were called to freedom—only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 
GAL.5.14	For the whole 
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not destroyed by one another. 
GAL.5.16	But I say, walk by the 
GAL.5.17	For the flesh sets its desire against the 
GAL.5.18	But if you are led by the 
GAL.5.19	Now the deeds of the flesh are clear: sexual immorality, impurity, indecency, 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, witchcraft, hostility, strife, jealousy, rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions, 
GAL.5.21	envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, just as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit God’s kingdom. 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, and self-control—against such things there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	Now those who belong to Messiah have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 
GAL.5.25	If we live by the 
GAL.5.26	Let us not become conceited—provoking one another, envying one another. 
GAL.6.1	Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught doing something wrong, you who are directed by the 
GAL.6.2	Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you fulfill the 
GAL.6.3	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is fooling himself. 
GAL.6.4	Rather let each one examine his own work. Then he will have pride in himself alone and not in comparison to anyone else. 
GAL.6.5	For each one will carry his own load. 
GAL.6.6	Now let the one who is taught the word share all good things with his teacher. 
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived—God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he also shall reap. 
GAL.6.8	For the one who sows in the flesh will reap corruption from the flesh. But the one who sows in the 
GAL.6.9	So let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we don’t give up. 
GAL.6.10	Therefore, whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good toward all—especially those who belong to the household of faith.
GAL.6.11	Notice the large letters—I am writing to you with my own hand. 
GAL.6.12	Those wanting to look good outwardly are trying to force you to be circumcised—only so they will not be persecuted for the cross of Messiah. 
GAL.6.13	For not even the circumcised keep 
GAL.6.14	But may I never boast—except in the cross of our Lord 
GAL.6.15	For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything—but only a new creation. 
GAL.6.16	Now as many as live by this rule—
GAL.6.17	From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I bear on my body the scars of 
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord 
EPH.1.1	Paul, an emissary of Messiah 
EPH.1.2	Grace and 
EPH.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord 
EPH.1.4	He chose us in the Messiah before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before Him in love. 
EPH.1.5	He predestined us for adoption as sons through Messiah 
EPH.1.6	to the glorious praise of His grace, with which He favored us through the One He loves! 
EPH.1.7	In Him we have redemption through His blood—the removal of trespasses—in keeping with the richness of His grace 
EPH.1.8	that He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight, 
EPH.1.9	He made known to us the mystery of His will, in keeping with His good pleasure that He planned in Messiah. 
EPH.1.10	The plan of the fullness of times is to bring all things together in the Messiah—both things in heaven and things on earth, all in Him. 
EPH.1.11	In Him we also were chosen, predestined according to His plan. He keeps working out all things according to the purpose of His will— 
EPH.1.12	so that we, who were first to put our hope in Messiah, might be for His glorious praise. 
EPH.1.13	After you heard the message of truth—the Good News of your salvation—and when you put your trust in Him, you were sealed with the promised 
EPH.1.14	He is the guarantee of our inheritance, until the redemption of His possession—to His glorious praise! 
EPH.1.15	Therefore, ever since I heard of your trust in the Lord 
EPH.1.16	I never stop giving thanks for you as I mention you in my prayers— 
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord 
EPH.1.18	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what is the richness of His glorious inheritance in the 
EPH.1.19	and what is His exceedingly great power toward us who keep trusting Him—in keeping with the working of His mighty strength. 
EPH.1.20	This power He exercised in Messiah when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in heaven. 
EPH.1.21	He is far above any ruler, authority, power, leader, and every name that is named—not only in the 
EPH.1.22	God placed all things under Messiah’s feet and appointed Him as head over all things for His community— 
EPH.1.23	which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. 
EPH.2.1	You were dead in your trespasses and sins. 
EPH.2.2	At that time, you walked in the way of this world, in conformity to the ruler of the domain of the air—the ruler of the spirit who is now operating in the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.2.3	We too all lived among them in the cravings of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and the mind. By nature we were children of wrath, just like the others. 
EPH.2.4	But God was rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us. 
EPH.2.5	Even when we were dead in our trespasses, He made us alive together with Messiah. (By grace you have been saved!) 
EPH.2.6	And He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Messiah 
EPH.2.7	to show in the 
EPH.2.8	For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not from yourselves—it is the gift of God. 
EPH.2.9	It is not based on deeds, so that no one may boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are His workmanship—created in Messiah 
EPH.2.11	Therefore, keep in mind that once you—Gentiles in the flesh—were called “uncircumcision” by those called “circumcision” (which is performed on flesh by hand). 
EPH.2.12	At that time you were separate from Messiah, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Messiah 
EPH.2.14	For He is our 
EPH.2.15	the law code of 
EPH.2.16	and to reconcile both to God in one body through the cross—by which He put the hostility to death. 
EPH.2.17	And He came and proclaimed 
EPH.2.18	for through Him we both have access to the Father by the same 
EPH.2.19	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household. 
EPH.2.20	You have been built on the foundation made up of the emissaries and prophets, with Messiah 
EPH.2.21	In Him the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple for the Lord. 
EPH.2.22	In Him, you also are being built together into God’s dwelling place in the 
EPH.3.1	For this reason I, Paul, am a prisoner of Messiah 
EPH.3.2	Surely you have heard about the plan of God’s grace given to me for you— 
EPH.3.3	that the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote before briefly. 
EPH.3.4	When you read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Messiah— 
EPH.3.5	which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations, as it has now been revealed by the 
EPH.3.6	This mystery is that the Gentiles are joint heirs and fellow members of the same body and co-sharers of the promise in Messiah 
EPH.3.7	I became a servant of this Good News by the gift of God’s favor given to me through the exercise of His power. 
EPH.3.8	This favor was given to me, the very least of His 
EPH.3.9	and to bring to light the plan of the mystery—which for ages was hidden in God, who created all things. 
EPH.3.10	The purpose is that through Messiah’s community the multi-faceted wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places, 
EPH.3.11	which is in keeping with the eternal purpose that He carried out in Messiah 
EPH.3.12	In Him we have boldness and access with confidence through trusting in Him. 
EPH.3.13	So I ask you not to be discouraged by my troubles on your behalf—they are your glory. 
EPH.3.14	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father— 
EPH.3.15	from Him every family in heaven and on earth receives its name. 
EPH.3.16	I pray that from His glorious riches He would grant you to be strengthened in your inner being with power through His 
EPH.3.17	so that Messiah may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 
EPH.3.18	may have strength to grasp with all the 
EPH.3.19	and to know the love of Messiah which surpasses knowledge, so you may be filled up with all the fullness of God. 
EPH.3.20	Now to Him who is able to do far beyond all that we ask or imagine, by means of His power that works in us, 
EPH.3.21	to Him be the glory in the community of believers and in Messiah 
EPH.4.1	Therefore I, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you were called— 
EPH.4.2	with complete humility and gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, 
EPH.4.3	making every effort to keep the unity of the 
EPH.4.4	There is one body and one 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one immersion; 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. 
EPH.4.7	But to each one of us grace was given in keeping with the measure of Messiah’s gift. 
EPH.4.8	Therefore it says, “When He went up on high, He led captive a troop of captives and gave gifts to his people.” 
EPH.4.9	Now what does “He went up” mean, except that He first went down to the lower regions of the earth? 
EPH.4.10	The One who came down is the same One who went up far above all the heavens, in order to fill all things. 
EPH.4.11	He Himself gave some to be emissaries, some as prophets, some as proclaimers of the Good News, and some as shepherds and teachers— 
EPH.4.12	to equip the 
EPH.4.13	This will continue until we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of 
EPH.4.14	As a result, we are no longer to be like children, tossed around by the waves and blown all over by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of men with cunning in deceitful scheming. 
EPH.4.15	Instead, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all ways into Messiah, who is the Head. 
EPH.4.16	From Him the whole body is fitted and held together by every supporting ligament. The proper working of each individual part produces the body’s growth, for building itself up in love.
EPH.4.17	So I tell you this, indeed I insist on it in the Lord—walk no longer as the pagans do, stumbling around in the futility of their thinking. 
EPH.4.18	They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance in them due to the hardness of their heart. 
EPH.4.19	Since they are past feeling, they have turned themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of immorality, with greed for more. 
EPH.4.20	However, you did not learn Messiah in this way— 
EPH.4.21	if indeed you have heard Him and were taught in Him, as the truth is in 
EPH.4.22	With respect to your former lifestyle, you are to lay aside the old self corrupted by its deceitful desires, 
EPH.4.23	be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 
EPH.4.24	and put on the new self—created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. 
EPH.4.25	So lay aside lying and “each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,” for we are members of one another. 
EPH.4.26	“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun go down on your anger, 
EPH.4.27	nor give the devil a foothold. 
EPH.4.28	The one who steals must steal no longer—instead he must work, doing something useful with his own hands, so he may have something to share with the one who has need. 
EPH.4.29	Let no harmful word come out of your mouth, but only what is beneficial for building others up according to the need, so that it gives grace to those who hear it. 
EPH.4.30	Do not grieve the 
EPH.4.31	Get rid of all bitterness and rage and anger and quarreling and slander, along with all malice. 
EPH.4.32	Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other just as God in Messiah also forgave you. 
EPH.5.1	Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children; 
EPH.5.2	and walk in love, just as Messiah also loved us and gave Himself up for us as an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma. 
EPH.5.3	But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed—don’t even let these be mentioned among you, as is proper for 
EPH.5.4	Obscene, coarse, and stupid talk are also out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. 
EPH.5.5	Know for certain that no immoral, indecent, or greedy person—who is really an idol worshipper at heart—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Messiah and God. 
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s judgment comes on the children of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Therefore do not be partners with them. 
EPH.5.8	For once you were darkness, but now in union with the Lord you are light. Walk as children of light 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 
EPH.5.10	trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	Take no part in the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them— 
EPH.5.12	for it is disgraceful even to mention the things that are done by them in secret. 
EPH.5.13	Yet everything exposed by the light is being made visible, 
EPH.5.14	for everything made visible is light. This is why it says, “Wake up, O sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Messiah will shine on you.” 
EPH.5.15	So pay close attention to how you walk—not as unwise people but as wise. 
EPH.5.16	Make the most of your time because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	For this reason do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. 
EPH.5.18	And do not get drunk on wine, for that is recklessness. Instead, be filled with the 
EPH.5.19	speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your heart to the Lord— 
EPH.5.20	always giving thanks for everything to God the Father, in the name of the Lord 
EPH.5.21	Also submit yourselves to one another out of reverence for Messiah— 
EPH.5.22	wives to your own husbands as to the Lord. 
EPH.5.23	For the husband is head of the wife, as Messiah also is head of His community—Himself the Savior of the body. 
EPH.5.24	But as Messiah’s community is submitted to Messiah, so also the wives to their husbands in everything. 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives just as Messiah also loved His community and gave Himself up for her 
EPH.5.26	to make her holy, having cleansed her by immersion in the word. 
EPH.5.27	Messiah did this so that He might present to Himself His glorious community—not having stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but in order that she might be holy and blameless. 
EPH.5.28	In the same way, husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it—just as Messiah also does His community, 
EPH.5.30	because we are members of His body. 
EPH.5.31	“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 
EPH.5.32	This mystery is great—but I am talking about Messiah and His community. 
EPH.5.33	In any case, let each of you love his own wife as himself, and let the wife respect her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
EPH.6.2	“Honor your father and mother” (which is the first commandment with a promise), 
EPH.6.3	“so that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.” 
EPH.6.4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your human masters, with respect and reverence, with sincerity of heart, as you would the Messiah— 
EPH.6.6	not just under your master’s eye as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Messiah doing God’s will from the soul. 
EPH.6.7	Serve with a positive attitude, as to the Lord and not to men— 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. 
EPH.6.9	And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Stop using threats, knowing that the Master—of them and of you, too—is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you are able to stand against the schemes of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the worldly forces of this darkness, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. 
EPH.6.13	Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist when the times are evil, and after you have done everything, to stand firm. 
EPH.6.14	Stand firm then! Buckle the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness. 
EPH.6.15	Strap up your feet in readiness with the Good News of 
EPH.6.16	Above all, take up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
EPH.6.17	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
EPH.6.18	Pray in the 
EPH.6.19	And pray for me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News, 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may speak boldly, the way I should. 
EPH.6.21	Now Tychicus, my dearly loved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will give you all the news about me so you may know how I’m doing. 
EPH.6.22	I have sent him to you for this very reason, so you may know how we are and he may encourage your hearts. 
EPH.6.23	 to the brothers and sisters, and trusting love from God the Father and the Lord 
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord 
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, slaves of Messiah 
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and 
PHP.1.3	I thank my God at every memory of you, 
PHP.1.4	always praying with joy in every prayer of mine for you all, 
PHP.1.5	because of your sharing in the Good News from the first day until now. 
PHP.1.6	I am sure of this very thing—that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the Day of Messiah 
PHP.1.7	It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart—for you all are partakers of grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the affection of Messiah 
PHP.1.9	Now this I pray, that your love might overflow still more and more in knowledge and depth of discernment, 
PHP.1.10	in order to approve what is excellent—so that in the Day of Messiah you may be sincere and blameless, 
PHP.1.11	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through 
PHP.1.12	Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the advancement of the Good News. 
PHP.1.13	And so my imprisonment in the cause of Messiah has become well known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard and to everyone else. 
PHP.1.14	Because of my imprisonment, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord to dare more than ever to speak the message fearlessly. 
PHP.1.15	Some are proclaiming the Messiah out of envy and strife, but others out of good will. 
PHP.1.16	The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News. 
PHP.1.17	The former proclaim Messiah not sincerely, but out of selfishness—expecting to stir up trouble for me in my imprisonment. 
PHP.1.18	But what does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in dishonesty or in truth, Messiah is being proclaimed—and in this I rejoice! Yes, and I will keep rejoicing, 
PHP.1.19	for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance, through your intercession and the help of the 
PHP.1.20	My eager expectation and hope is that in no way will I be put to shame, but that with complete boldness Messiah will even now, as always, be exalted in my body—whether through life or through death. 
PHP.1.21	For to me, to live is Messiah and to die is gain. 
PHP.1.22	But if to live on in the body means fruit from my work, what shall I choose? I do not know. 
PHP.1.23	I am torn between the two—having a desire to leave and be with Messiah, which is far better; 
PHP.1.24	yet for your sake, to remain in the body is more necessary. 
PHP.1.25	Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith— 
PHP.1.26	so that your confidence in Messiah 
PHP.1.27	Only live your lives in a manner worthy of the Good News of the Messiah. Then, whether I come and see you or I am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit—striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the Good News 
PHP.1.28	and not being frightened in any way by your opponents. For them this is a sign of destruction, but for you salvation—and that from God. 
PHP.1.29	For to you was granted for Messiah’s sake not only to trust in Him, but also to suffer for His sake— 
PHP.1.30	experiencing the same struggle you saw in me and now you are hearing in me. 
PHP.2.1	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Messiah, if there is any comfort of love, if there is any fellowship of the 
PHP.2.2	then make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, united in spirit, with one purpose. 
PHP.2.3	Do nothing out of selfishness or conceit, but with humility consider others as more important than yourselves, 
PHP.2.4	looking out not only for your own interests but also for the interests of others. 
PHP.2.5	Have this attitude in yourselves, which also was in Messiah 
PHP.2.6	Who, though existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal to God a thing to be grasped. 
PHP.2.7	But He emptied Himself— taking on the form of a slave, becoming the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man. 
PHP.2.8	He humbled Himself— becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 
PHP.2.9	For this reason God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, 
PHP.2.10	that at the name of 
PHP.2.11	and every tongue profess that 
PHP.2.12	Therefore, my loved ones, just as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence—work out your salvation with fear and trembling. 
PHP.2.13	For the One working in you is God—both to will and to work for His good pleasure. 
PHP.2.14	Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 
PHP.2.15	so that you might be blameless and innocent, children of God in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation. Among them you shine as lights in the world, 
PHP.2.16	holding fast to the word of life, so that I may boast in the day of Messiah that I did not run or labor in vain. 
PHP.2.17	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and the service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. 
PHP.2.18	The same way, you also—rejoice and share your joy with me!
PHP.2.19	But I hope in the Lord 
PHP.2.20	I have no one else like him who will genuinely care about you— 
PHP.2.21	for all seek after their own interests, not those of Messiah 
PHP.2.22	But you know Timothy’s proven character, that he served with me in spreading the Good News like a son with his father. 
PHP.2.23	Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me. 
PHP.2.24	And I trust in the Lord that soon I too will come myself. 
PHP.2.25	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus—my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, as well as your messenger and aide to my need. 
PHP.2.26	For he was longing for you all and troubled because you heard that he was sick. 
PHP.2.27	He certainly was sick, close to death. But God had mercy on him—and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	Therefore I have sent him with special urgency, so that when you see him again you might rejoice and I might be less worried about you. 
PHP.2.29	So welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard, 
PHP.2.30	because he came close to death for the work of Messiah, risking his life to make up for what was lacking in your service to me.
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! To keep writing the same things to you is not troublesome for me—but for you it is a safeguard. 
PHP.3.2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation. 
PHP.3.3	For it is we who are the circumcision, who worship by the 
PHP.3.4	though I myself might have confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he might depend on the flesh, I far more— 
PHP.3.5	circumcised the eighth day; of the nation of Israel; from the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the 
PHP.3.6	as for zeal, persecuting Messiah’s community; as for 
PHP.3.7	But whatever things were gain to me, these I have considered as loss for the sake of the Messiah. 
PHP.3.8	More than that, I consider all things to be loss in comparison to the surpassing value of the knowledge of Messiah 
PHP.3.9	and be found in Him not having my righteousness derived from 
PHP.3.10	My aim is to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the sharing of His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death— 
PHP.3.11	if somehow I might arrive at the resurrection from among the dead. 
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already obtained this or been perfected, but I press on if only I might take hold of that for which Messiah 
PHP.3.13	Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself as having taken hold of this. But this one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal for the reward of the upward calling of God in Messiah 
PHP.3.15	Therefore let all who are mature have this attitude; and if you have a different attitude in anything, this also God will reveal to you. 
PHP.3.16	Nevertheless, let us live up to the same standard we have attained. 
PHP.3.17	Brothers and sisters, join in following my example and notice those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. (
PHP.3.18	For many walk who are enemies of the cross of Messiah—I have often told you about them, and now I am even weeping as I tell you. 
PHP.3.19	Their end is destruction—their god is their belly and their glory is in their shame. They set their minds on earthly things.) 
PHP.3.20	For our citizenship is in heaven, and from there we eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord 
PHP.3.21	He will transform this humble body of ours into the likeness of His glorious body, through the power that enables Him even to put all things in subjection to Himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brothers and sisters whom I love and long for, my joy and crown—stand firm in the Lord in this way, my loved ones. 
PHP.4.2	I urge Euodia and Syntyche to be in harmony in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	Yes, and I ask you, true companion, to help these women—they labored side by side with me in spreading the Good News, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life. 
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always—again I will say, rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	Let your gentleness be known to all people. The Lord is near. 
PHP.4.6	Do not be anxious about anything—but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. 
PHP.4.7	And the 
PHP.4.8	Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any virtue and if there is anything worthy of praise—dwell on these things. 
PHP.4.9	What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—put these things into practice, and the God of 
PHP.4.10	I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me (though you were concerned before but lacked opportunity to show it). 
PHP.4.11	I am not saying this because I am in need—for whatever circumstance I am in, I have learned to be content. 
PHP.4.12	I know what it is to live with humble means, and I know what it is to live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment—both to be filled and to go hungry, to have abundance and to suffer need. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Messiah who strengthens me. 
PHP.4.14	Nevertheless, you have done well to share in my trouble. 
PHP.4.15	Now you Philippians also know that in the beginning of the Good News, when I left Macedonia, not a single community partnered with me in giving and receiving—except you alone. 
PHP.4.16	For even in Thessalonica you sent something for my need more than once. 
PHP.4.17	Not that I am looking for a gift, but for fruit that overflows to your credit. 
PHP.4.18	But I have received everything and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 
PHP.4.19	My God will fulfill every need of yours according to the riches of His glory in Messiah 
PHP.4.20	To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen. 
PHP.4.21	Greet all the 
PHP.4.22	All the 
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord 
COL.1.1	Paul, an emissary of Messiah 
COL.1.2	To the 
COL.1.3	We always thank God, the Father of our Lord 
COL.1.4	For we heard of your trust in Messiah 
COL.1.5	because of the hope stored up for you in heaven. You heard before about this hope in the true message of the Good News 
COL.1.6	that has come to you. In all the world this Good News is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has in you since you first heard it and came to truly know God’s grace. 
COL.1.7	You learned it from Epaphras—our dearly loved fellow slave, who is a faithful servant of Messiah on our behalf. 
COL.1.8	He also made clear to us your love in the 
COL.1.9	For this reason also, ever since we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We keep asking God that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding— 
COL.1.10	to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God. 
COL.1.11	We pray that you may be strengthened with all the power that comes from His glorious might, for you to have all kinds of patience and steadfastness. With joy 
COL.1.12	we give thanks to the Father, who qualified you to share in the inheritance of the 
COL.1.13	He rescued us from the domain of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son whom He loves. 
COL.1.14	In Him we have redemption—the release of sins.
COL.1.15	He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. 
COL.1.16	For by Him all things were created— in heaven and on earth, the seen and the unseen, whether thrones or angelic powers or rulers or authorities. All was created through Him and for Him. 
COL.1.17	He exists before everything, and in Him all holds together. 
COL.1.18	He is the head of the body, His community. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead— so that He might come to have first place in all things. 
COL.1.19	For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him 
COL.1.20	and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, making peace through the blood of His cross— whether things on earth or things in heaven! 
COL.1.21	Once you were alienated from God and hostile in your attitude by wicked deeds. 
COL.1.22	But now He has reconciled you in Messiah’s physical body through death, in order to present you holy, spotless and blameless in His eyes— 
COL.1.23	if indeed you continue in the faith, established and firm, not budging from the hope of the Good News that you have heard. This Good News has been proclaimed throughout all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become its servant. 
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and in my physical body—for the sake of His body, Messiah’s community—I fill up what is lacking in the afflictions of Messiah. 
COL.1.25	I became its servant according to God’s commission, given to me for you, in order to declare His message in full— 
COL.1.26	the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations, but now has been revealed to His 
COL.1.27	God chose to make known to them this glorious mystery regarding the Gentiles—which is Messiah in you, the hope of glory! 
COL.1.28	We proclaim Him, warning and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Messiah. 
COL.1.29	To this end I labor, striving with all His strength which is powerfully at work in me. 
COL.2.1	I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea, as well as for those who have still not seen me face to face. 
COL.2.2	My purpose is that their hearts, joined together in love, may be encouraged. May they have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, leading to a true knowledge of the mystery of God—that is, Messiah. 
COL.2.3	In Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. 
COL.2.4	I am telling you this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive-sounding arguments. 
COL.2.5	For even though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit—rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your trust in Messiah.
COL.2.6	Therefore as you received Messiah 
COL.2.7	rooted and built up in Him and established in your faith just as you were taught, overflowing with thankfulness. 
COL.2.8	See that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men and the basic principles of the world rather than Messiah. 
COL.2.9	For all the fullness of Deity lives bodily in Him, 
COL.2.10	and in Him you have been filled to fullness. He is the head over every ruler and authority. 
COL.2.11	In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision done not by hand, in the stripping away of the body of the flesh through the circumcision of Messiah. 
COL.2.12	You were buried along with Him in immersion, through which you also were raised with Him by trusting in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. 
COL.2.13	When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with Him when He pardoned us all our transgressions. 
COL.2.14	He wiped out the handwritten record of debts with the decrees against us, which was hostile to us. He took it away by nailing it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	After disarming the principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in the cross. 
COL.2.16	Therefore, do not let anyone pass judgment on you in matters of food or drink, or in respect to a festival or new moon or Shabbat. 
COL.2.17	These are a foreshadowing of things to come, but the reality is Messiah. 
COL.2.18	Let no one disqualify you by insisting on false humility and worship of angels—going into detail about what he has seen, puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind. 
COL.2.19	He is not holding fast to the Head. It is from Him that the whole body, nourished and held together by its joints and tendons, grows with a godly increase. 
COL.2.20	If you died with Messiah to the basic principles of the world, why—as though living in the world—do you subject yourselves to their rules? 
COL.2.21	“Don’t handle! Don’t taste! Don’t touch!” 
COL.2.22	These all lead to decay with use, based as they are on man-made commands and teachings. 
COL.2.23	Indeed, these are matters that have an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility and self-denial of the body—yet none are of any value for stopping indulgence of the flesh.
COL.3.1	Therefore, if you have been raised up with Messiah, keep seeking the things above—where Messiah is, sitting at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Focus your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. 
COL.3.3	For you have died, and your life is hidden with Messiah in God. 
COL.3.4	When Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him, in glory! 
COL.3.5	Therefore, put to death what is earthly in you—sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed—for that is idolatry. 
COL.3.6	Because of such things God’s wrath is coming upon the sons of disobedience. 
COL.3.7	At one time you also walked in these ways, when you used to live in these ways. 
COL.3.8	But now, set them all aside—anger, rage, malice, slander, and foul language out of your mouth. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to one another. After all, you have taken off the old self with its practices 
COL.3.10	and have put on the new self that is being renewed in knowledge, according to the image of the One who created him. 
COL.3.11	Here there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, savage, slave and free; but Messiah is all, and in all. 
COL.3.12	Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves in tender compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience— 
COL.3.13	bearing with one another and forgiving each other, if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the Lord pardoned you, so also you must pardon others. 
COL.3.14	But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfect harmony. 
COL.3.15	Let the 
COL.3.16	Let the word of Messiah dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with gratitude in your hearts to God. 
COL.3.17	And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord 
COL.3.18	Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and do not become harsh toward them. 
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in every respect, for this is pleasing to the Lord. 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become discouraged. 
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey your human masters in every respect—not just within your master’s sight as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. 
COL.3.23	Whatever you do, work at it from the soul, as for the Lord and not for people. 
COL.3.24	For you know that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as a reward. It is to the Lord Messiah you are giving service. 
COL.3.25	For the one doing wrong will be paid back for what he did wrong, and there is no favoritism. 
COL.4.1	Masters, give your slaves what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. 
COL.4.2	Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving. 
COL.4.3	At the same time, keep praying for us as well, that God may open up to us a door for the message, to proclaim the mystery of Messiah—for which I am in prison. 
COL.4.4	Pray that I may make the mystery clear, as I ought to speak. 
COL.4.5	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 
COL.4.6	Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, to know how you ought to answer everyone. 
COL.4.7	Tychicus—a dearly loved brother and trustworthy servant and fellow slave to the Lord—will tell you all the news about me. 
COL.4.8	I sent him to you for this very purpose, so you may know about us and he may encourage your hearts. 
COL.4.9	With him I sent Onesimus—a faithful and dear brother, who is one of your own. They will tell you about everything here. 
COL.4.10	My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You received instructions about him—if he comes your way, welcome him.) 
COL.4.11	 who is called Justus also sends his greetings. These are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God that are from among the circumcision—they have been a comfort to me. 
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of your own, a slave of Messiah 
COL.4.13	For I testify that he has gone to much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Luke, the dearly loved physician, sends you greetings, and so does Demas. 
COL.4.15	Greet the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, as well as Nympha and the community that meets in her house. 
COL.4.16	When this letter has been read among you, make sure that it is also read in Messiah’s community of Laodicea. In turn, you should read my letter coming from Laodicea. 
COL.4.17	Tell Archippus, “See to it that you complete the service you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.” 
COL.4.18	This greeting is in my own hand—Paul’s. Remember my chains! Grace be with you.
1TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the community of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord 
1TH.1.2	We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers—continually 
1TH.1.3	remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadiness of hope in our Lord 
1TH.1.4	We know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that you are chosen, 
1TH.1.5	because our Good News did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the 
1TH.1.6	You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having accepted the message in much tribulation, with the joy of the 
1TH.1.7	So you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 
1TH.1.8	For the word of the Lord rang out from you—not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faithfulness toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to say anything. 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves bring news about what kind of welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, 
1TH.1.10	and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—
1TH.2.1	For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not in vain. 
1TH.2.2	On the contrary, after we had first suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to tell you the Good News of God—even in the midst of much opposition. 
1TH.2.3	For our urging is not out of deceit or impure motives or trickery. 
1TH.2.4	But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we declare it—not pleasing men but rather God, who examines our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	For as you know and God is witness, we never came with a word of flattery or a motive of greed— 
1TH.2.6	or seeking glory from people, whether from you or from others, 
1TH.2.7	even though we could have thrown our weight around as emissaries of Messiah. Rather, we proved to be infants among you. Like a nursing mother cherishes her children, 
1TH.2.8	in this way we were yearning for you. We were delighted to share with you not only the Good News of God but also our very souls, because you had become dear to us. 
1TH.2.9	For you recall, brothers and sisters, our labor and hardship—working night and day, so as not to burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the Good News of God. 
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses, along with God, of how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we behaved toward you who believe. 
1TH.2.11	For you know how, as a father with his own children, 
1TH.2.12	we exhorted and encouraged and urged each one of you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. 
1TH.2.13	For this reason, we also thank God constantly that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is—the word of God, which does its work in you who believe. 
1TH.2.14	For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s communities in Messiah 
1TH.2.15	who killed both the Lord 
1TH.2.16	hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they might be saved. As a result, they constantly fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last. 
1TH.2.17	But brothers and sisters, after we were orphaned by separation from you for a short time (in person, not in heart), we were all the more eager in our great longing to see you face to face. 
1TH.2.18	For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—but satan thwarted us. 
1TH.2.19	For who is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord 
1TH.2.20	For you are our glory and joy!
1TH.3.1	So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind alone in Athens. 
1TH.3.2	We sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker for God in proclaiming the Good News of Messiah, in order to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, 
1TH.3.3	so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know we are destined for this. 
1TH.3.4	For even when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer persecution— just as has happened, as you know. 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faithfulness, for fear that the tempter had tempted you and that our labor might be in vain. 
1TH.3.6	But now that Timothy has come to us from you and brought us the good news of your faithfulness and love, and that you always have good memories of us, longing to see us just as we long to see you— 
1TH.3.7	because of this, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and trouble, we were comforted about you by your faithfulness. 
1TH.3.8	For now we live, since you are standing firm in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	For what thanks would be enough to offer to God, in return for all the joy we feel before our God because of you? 
1TH.3.10	Night time and day time we keep praying more than ever to see you face to face, and mend any shortcomings in your faith. 
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father Himself and 
1TH.3.12	May the Lord also cause you to increase and overflow in love for one another and for all people, just as we also do for you, 
1TH.3.13	in order to strengthen your hearts as blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord 
1TH.4.1	Finally then, brothers and sisters, we ask you and appeal in the Lord 
1TH.4.2	For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord 
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God—your sanctification: to abstain from sexual immorality; 
1TH.4.4	to know, each of you, how to gain control over his own body in holiness and honor— 
1TH.4.5	not in the passion of lust like the pagans who do not know God; 
1TH.4.6	and not to overstep his brother and take advantage of him in this matter— because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, as we told you before and solemnly warned you. 
1TH.4.7	For God did not call us to impurity, but in holiness. 
1TH.4.8	Consequently, the one who rejects this is not rejecting man, but God, who gives His 
1TH.4.9	Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write you—for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another. 
1TH.4.10	In fact, you even practice it toward all your brothers and sisters throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to keep progressing more and more 
1TH.4.11	and aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, just as we directed you— 
1TH.4.12	so you may behave properly toward outsiders and not have need of anything.
1TH.4.13	Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep, so that you may not grieve like the rest who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that 
1TH.4.15	For this we tell you, by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede those who are asleep. 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord Himself shall come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the blast of God’s 
1TH.4.17	Then we who are alive, who are left behind, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air—and so we shall always be with the Lord. 
1TH.4.18	Therefore encourage one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers and sisters, you have no need for anything to be written to you. 
1TH.5.2	For you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	When they are saying, “
1TH.5.4	But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the dark, so that the Day might overtake you like a thief. 
1TH.5.5	For you all are sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night or of darkness— 
1TH.5.6	so then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain on the alert and sober-minded. 
1TH.5.7	For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But since we are of the day, let us be sober-minded—putting on the breastplate of faithfulness and love, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 
1TH.5.9	For God did not destine us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord 
1TH.5.10	He died for us so that, whether we may be awake or asleep, we may live together with Him. 
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage one another and build each other up—just as you in fact are doing.
1TH.5.12	Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to recognize those who work hard among you and are over you in the Lord and correct you, 
1TH.5.13	and to esteem them beyond all measure in love because of their work. Keep 
1TH.5.14	We urge you, brothers and sisters, correct the unruly, comfort the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 
1TH.5.15	See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all. 
1TH.5.16	Rejoice always, 
1TH.5.17	pray constantly, 
1TH.5.18	in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Messiah 
1TH.5.19	Do not quench the Spirit, 
1TH.5.20	do not despise prophetic messages, 
1TH.5.21	but test all things, hold fast to what is good, 
1TH.5.22	keep away from every kind of evil. 
1TH.5.23	Now may the God of 
1TH.5.24	Faithful is the One who calls you—and He will make it happen! 
1TH.5.25	Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss. 
1TH.5.27	I charge you under oath, by the Lord, that this letter be read to all the brothers and sisters. 
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord 
2TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the community of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord 
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and 
2TH.1.3	We ought to always thank God for you, brothers and sisters, as is appropriate, because your faithfulness grows wonderfully, and the love of each one of you for one another continually increases. 
2TH.1.4	Therefore, we ourselves boast of you among the communities of God—about your perseverance and faithfulness through all the persecutions and troubles that you endure. 
2TH.1.5	This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering. (
2TH.1.6	For after all, it is right in the sight of God to pay back trouble to those who trouble you, 
2TH.1.7	and relief to you who suffer trouble along with us. At the revelation of the Lord 
2TH.1.8	in flaming fire, He will command judgment on those who do not know God and do not heed the Good News of our Lord 
2TH.1.9	They will pay the price of eternal ruin, away from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His power— 
2TH.1.10	on that Day when He comes to be glorified among His 
2TH.1.11	With this in mind, we pray for you constantly, that our God may consider you worthy of the calling and fulfill with power every good desire and work of faith, 
2TH.1.12	so the name of our Lord 
2TH.2.1	Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, concerning the coming of our Lord 
2TH.2.2	not to get shaken out of your mind or disturbed—either by a spirit or a word or a letter as if through us—as though the Day of the Lord has come. 
2TH.2.3	Let no one deceive you in any way, for the Day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the one destined to be destroyed. 
2TH.2.4	He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in the Temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God. 
2TH.2.5	Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I was telling you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And you know what now holds back, for him to be revealed in his own time. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness is already operating; only there is one who holds back just now, until he is taken out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	Then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord 
2TH.2.9	The coming of the lawless one is connected to the activity of satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, 
2TH.2.10	and with every kind of wicked deception toward those who are perishing. They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth so as to be saved. 
2TH.2.11	For this reason God sends them a delusional force, to lead them to believe what is false, 
2TH.2.12	so that they may be judged—all those who did not believe the truth but delighted in wickedness. 
2TH.2.13	But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits for salvation through sanctification by the 
2TH.2.14	He called you to this salvation through our proclaiming the Good News, for you to gain the glory of our Lord 
2TH.2.15	So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold on to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by our letter. 
2TH.2.16	Now may our Lord 
2TH.2.17	comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good deed and word. 
2TH.3.1	Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread quickly and be glorified—just as it is with you. 
2TH.3.2	Also pray that we may be rescued from perverse and evil people, for not all are trustworthy. 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is trustworthy—and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one. 
2TH.3.4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will keep doing what we command. 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Messiah. 
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord 
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, for we did not behave inappropriately among you. 
2TH.3.8	And we did not eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but worked night and day with labor and hardship, so as not to burden any of you. 
2TH.3.9	It wasn’t that we had no right, but rather to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate. 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, we would give you this order: if anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. 
2TH.3.11	For we hear that some among you are behaving irresponsibly—not busy, but busybodies. 
2TH.3.12	Now such people we command and urge in the Lord Messiah 
2TH.3.13	But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary of doing good. 
2TH.3.14	If anyone does not obey our message in this letter, take special note of him and do not associate with him, so that he may be put to shame. 
2TH.3.15	Yet do not consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. 
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of 
2TH.3.17	The greeting is in my own hand—Paul’s. It is a sign in every letter—in this way I write. 
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord 
1TI.1.1	Paul, an emissary of Messiah 
1TI.1.2	To Timothy, a true child in faith: Grace, mercy, 
1TI.1.3	As I urged you, when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay in Ephesus to direct certain people not to pass on different instruction, 
1TI.1.4	or to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These give rise to useless speculations rather than God’s training which is in faithfulness. 
1TI.1.5	Now the goal of this command is love from of a pure heart and a clear conscience and a genuine faith. 
1TI.1.6	Some, having missed the mark, have turned away to fruitless discussion— 
1TI.1.7	wanting to be teachers of 
1TI.1.8	But we know that the 
1TI.1.9	knowing that the 
1TI.1.10	the sexually immoral, homosexuals, slave-traders, liars, perjurers, and for anything else that opposes sound teaching— 
1TI.1.11	in keeping with what was entrusted to me, the glorious Good News of the blessed God. 
1TI.1.12	I thank Messiah 
1TI.1.13	even though I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. Yet I was shown mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, 
1TI.1.14	and the grace of our Lord overflowed with the faith and love that are in Messiah 
1TI.1.15	Trustworthy is the saying and deserving of complete acceptance: “Messiah 
1TI.1.16	Yet for this reason I was shown mercy—so that in me as the foremost, Messiah 
1TI.1.17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. 
1TI.1.18	This charge I entrust to you, Timothy my son, in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you, so that by them you fight the good fight, 
1TI.1.19	holding onto faith and a good conscience. By rejecting these, some have suffered shipwreck regarding their faith. 
1TI.1.20	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander—whom I have handed over to satan to be disciplined not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	Therefore, first of all I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made on behalf of all people— 
1TI.2.2	for kings and all who are in authority—so we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and respectfulness. 
1TI.2.3	This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior. 
1TI.2.4	He desires all men to be saved and come into the knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For there is one God and there is one Mediator between God and men—a human, Messiah 
1TI.2.6	who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony at the proper time. 
1TI.2.7	For this I was appointed a herald and an emissary (I am telling the truth; I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faithfulness and truth. 
1TI.2.8	So I desire all men to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without anger and argument. 
1TI.2.9	Likewise, women are to adorn themselves in appropriate clothing with modesty and sound judgment—not in seductive hairstyles and gold or pearls or costly clothing, 
1TI.2.10	but what is suitable for women claiming godliness, through good deeds. 
1TI.2.11	Let a woman receive training in a quiet demeanor with complete respect for order. 
1TI.2.12	But I do not allow a woman to train or dictate to a man, but to be in a quiet demeanor. 
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	Also Adam was not deceived but the woman—being deceived, she fell into transgression. 
1TI.2.15	Nevertheless, she will be sustained through childbearing—if they continue in faithfulness and love and holiness, with sound judgment. 
1TI.3.1	Trustworthy is the saying: “If any man aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work.” 
1TI.3.2	An overseer, then, must be beyond criticism—the husband of one wife, clear-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 
1TI.3.3	not addicted to wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money, 
1TI.3.4	managing his own household well, keeping his children under control with all respectfulness. 
1TI.3.5	(But if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s community?) 
1TI.3.6	He must not be a new believer, or he may become puffed up and fall into the same judgment as the devil. 
1TI.3.7	Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with those outside, so that he will not fall into disgrace and the devil’s trap. 
1TI.3.8	Servant-leaders likewise must be dignified, not double-speaking, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. 
1TI.3.9	They must keep hold of the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 
1TI.3.10	Also let them first be tested—then let those who are blameless serve as servant-leaders. 
1TI.3.11	Women likewise must be dignified, not backbiting; clear-minded, trustworthy in every respect. 
1TI.3.12	Let servant-leaders be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 
1TI.3.13	For those who have served well as servant-leaders gain for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Messiah 
1TI.3.14	These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly. 
1TI.3.15	But if I delay, I write so you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God—which is the community of the living God, a pillar and foundation of truth. 
1TI.3.16	Now beyond question, great is the mystery of godliness: He was revealed in the flesh, Vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Trusted throughout the world, Taken up in glory. 
1TI.4.1	Now the 
1TI.4.2	through the hypocrisy of false speakers—whose own conscience has been seared. 
1TI.4.3	They forbid people to marry; they command people to abstain from foods that God created for the faithful to share with thanksgiving, having come to know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving; 
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. 
1TI.4.6	In pointing out these things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Messiah 
1TI.4.7	But avoid godless myths and old wives’ tales; instead, train yourself in godliness. 
1TI.4.8	For physical exercise has some benefit; but godliness is beneficial for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the one to come. 
1TI.4.9	Trustworthy is the saying and deserving of complete acceptance 
1TI.4.10	(for to this end we work hard and strive): “We have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially those who trust.” 
1TI.4.11	Insist on these things and teach them. 
1TI.4.12	Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but become an example of the faithful—in speech, in conduct, in love, in faithfulness, and in purity. 
1TI.4.13	Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to encouragement, and to teaching. 
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands of the elders. 
1TI.4.15	Practice these things—be absorbed in them, so that your progress may be clear to all. 
1TI.4.16	Give attention to yourself and your teaching. Persevere in these things, for in doing so you will save yourself and those who hear you. 
1TI.5.1	Never speak harshly to an older man but appeal to him as a father; to younger men as brothers; 
1TI.5.2	older women as mothers; and younger women as sisters—with complete purity. 
1TI.5.3	Honor widows who are really widows— 
1TI.5.4	but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to show devotion to their own home and give back to their parents, for this is pleasing before God. 
1TI.5.5	Now she who is really a widow and has been left alone, has put her hope in God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day. 
1TI.5.6	But she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. 
1TI.5.7	Insist on these things, so that they might be beyond criticism. 
1TI.5.8	But if anyone does not provide for his own, especially those in his own house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 
1TI.5.9	Let a widow be listed only if she is at least sixty, was the wife of one husband, 
1TI.5.10	well known for good deeds, if she raised children, if she showed hospitality, if she washed the feet of the 
1TI.5.11	But refuse younger widows; for when their sensual desires draw them away from the Messiah, they want to get married— 
1TI.5.12	facing judgment because they have set aside their previous pledge. 
1TI.5.13	And at the same time, they also learn to be idle, going around from house to house—and not just idle, but also gossipers and busybodies, saying things they should not. 
1TI.5.14	Therefore, I want the younger widows to get married, have children, manage a household, and give no opportunity to the enemy for slander. 
1TI.5.15	For some have already gone astray after satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any woman of faith has widows in need, let her help them and not let the community be burdened, so it may help the real widows. 
1TI.5.17	The elders who lead well are worthy of honor and honorarium—especially those who work hard in the word and teaching. 
1TI.5.18	For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing,” and, “The worker is worthy of his wage.” 
1TI.5.19	Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	Correct those who continue sinning in the presence of everyone, so that the rest also may fear. 
1TI.5.21	I solemnly charge you—before God and Messiah 
1TI.5.22	Do not lay hands on anyone hastily or take part in the sins of others—keep yourself pure. 
1TI.5.23	(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach and for your frequent ailments.) 
1TI.5.24	The sins of some people are obvious, going before them into judgment; but for others, their sins follow. 
1TI.5.25	Likewise, good deeds are obvious, and the others cannot stay hidden.
1TI.6.1	Let all who are under the yoke as slaves consider their own masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered. 
1TI.6.2	And let those who have believing masters not disrespect them because they are brothers, but serve them even more, since those who share in the benefit are believers and loved. Teach and encourage these things.
1TI.6.3	If anyone passes on a different teaching and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord 
1TI.6.4	he is prideful, understanding nothing. Instead he is obsessed with arguments and disputes about words—out of which come envy, strife, slander, evil suspicions, 
1TI.6.5	and constant friction between people corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. 
1TI.6.6	Now godliness with contentment is great gain. 
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into this world, So we cannot take anything out of it. 
1TI.6.8	But having food and clothing, with these things we shall be content. 
1TI.6.9	But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil—some, longing for it, have gone astray from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
1TI.6.11	But you, O man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, perseverance, and gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith! Take hold of the eternal life—you were called to it, and you made the good confession for it in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	I charge you before God who gives life to all things and Messiah 
1TI.6.14	to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord 
1TI.6.15	This He will reveal in His own time—the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and the Lord of lords, 
1TI.6.16	who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or is able to see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen. 
1TI.6.17	Direct those who are rich in this present age not to be proud or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God—who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. 
1TI.6.18	Direct them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous, sharing, 
1TI.6.19	storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so they might take hold of the true life. 
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning away from pointless chatter and the contradictions of so-called knowledge— 
1TI.6.21	by professing it, some have missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
2TI.1.1	Paul, an emissary of Messiah 
2TI.1.2	To Timothy my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and 
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my forefathers did, when I continually remember you in my prayers night and day. 
2TI.1.4	I remember your tears, and I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	I recall the genuine faithfulness within you, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure it is within you as well. 
2TI.1.6	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
2TI.1.7	For God has not given us a spirit of timidity but of power and love and self-discipline. 
2TI.1.8	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but share in suffering for the Good News according to the power of God. 
2TI.1.9	He has saved us and called us with a holy calling— not because of our deeds but because of His own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Messiah 
2TI.1.10	but now has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Messiah 
2TI.1.11	For this Good News I was appointed a herald and an emissary and a teacher. 
2TI.1.12	For this reason I also am suffering these things—but I am not ashamed, for I know in whom I have trusted and I am convinced He is able to safeguard what I have entrusted to Him until that Day. 
2TI.1.13	Keep the standard of sound words you have heard from me, in the faithfulness and love that are in Messiah 
2TI.1.14	Guard the good that has been entrusted to you, through the 
2TI.1.15	You are aware that everyone in Asia has turned away from me—including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment. 
2TI.1.17	On the contrary, when he was in Rome he zealously searched for me and found me. 
2TI.1.18	May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! You know very well how much he served in Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	Therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Messiah 
2TI.2.2	And what you have heard from me among many witnesses, entrust to faithful people who will be capable to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Messiah 
2TI.2.4	No one serving as a soldier entangles himself in the activities of everyday life, so that he might please the one who enlisted him. 
2TI.2.5	Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned victorious unless he competes according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	The hard-working farmer ought to receive the first share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. 
2TI.2.8	Remember 
2TI.2.9	For this I suffer hardship as a criminal, even to the point of chains—though the word of God is not chained. 
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the chosen, so they might obtain the salvation that is in Messiah 
2TI.2.11	Trustworthy is the saying: If we died with Him, we will also live with Him; 
2TI.2.12	if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us; 
2TI.2.13	if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
2TI.2.14	Remind them of these things and solemnly charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which is useless—to the ruin of those who are listening. 
2TI.2.15	Make every effort to present yourself before God as tried and true, as an unashamed worker cutting a straight path with the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	But avoid godless chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness 
2TI.2.17	and their words will spread like cancer. Among them are Hymeneaus and Philetus— 
2TI.2.18	men who have missed the mark concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place. They are overturning the faith of some. 
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord keep away from unrighteousness.” 
2TI.2.20	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay—some for honor and some for common use. 
2TI.2.21	Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor—sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. 
2TI.2.22	Now flee from youthful desires; instead, pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and 
2TI.2.23	But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they produce quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	The Lord’s slave must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, tolerant. 
2TI.2.25	Let him give guidance with humility to those who are in opposition—perhaps God may grant them a change of mind, leading to the knowledge of truth. 
2TI.2.26	Then they may regain their senses and escape the devil’s snare, in which they had been held captive by him to do his will.
2TI.3.1	But understand this, that in the last days hard times will come— 
2TI.3.2	for people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	hardhearted, unforgiving, backbiting, without self-control, brutal, hating what is good, 
2TI.3.4	treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
2TI.3.5	holding to an outward form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid these people! 
2TI.3.6	For among these are those who slip into households and deceive weak women weighed down with sins, led away by various desires, 
2TI.3.7	always learning yet never able to come to the knowledge of truth. 
2TI.3.8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and worthless concerning the faith. 
2TI.3.9	But these people will not make any more progress—for their folly, like that of Jannes and Jambres, will be obvious to everyone. 
2TI.3.10	You, however, closely followed my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faithfulness, patience, love, perseverance— 
2TI.3.11	as well as persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! And the Lord rescued me from them all! 
2TI.3.12	Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Messiah 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and imposters will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
2TI.3.14	You, however, continue in what you have learned and what you have become convinced of. For you know from whom you have learned, 
2TI.3.15	and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to make you wise, leading to salvation through trusting in Messiah 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for restoration, and for training in righteousness, 
2TI.3.17	so that the person belonging to God may be capable, fully equipped for every good deed.
2TI.4.1	I solemnly charge you—in the presence of God and Messiah 
2TI.4.2	proclaim the Word! Be ready when it is convenient or inconvenient. Confront, rebuke, encourage—with complete patience and instruction. 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not put up with sound instruction, but they will pile up for themselves teachers in keeping with their own desires, to have their ears tickled. 
2TI.4.4	And they will turn away from hearing the truth and wander off to myths. 
2TI.4.5	You, however, keep a clear mind in all things, withstand hardship, do the work of proclaiming the Good News, and fulfill your service. 
2TI.4.6	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	In the future there is reserved for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not to me only, but also to everyone who has longed for His appearing. 
2TI.4.9	Do all you can to come to me quickly— 
2TI.4.10	for Demas, having loved this world, has deserted me and gone to Thessolonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	Luke is the only one with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. 
2TI.4.12	I have sent Tychius to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you come, bring the cloak which I left with Carpus in Troas, along with the scrolls, and especially the parchments. 
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm—the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 
2TI.4.15	Be on guard against him too, for he vehemently opposed our message. 
2TI.4.16	At my first defense, no one stood by me; instead, they all deserted me—may it not be counted against them! 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be proclaimed in full measure, and all the nations might hear—and I was rescued from the lion’s mouth! 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will deliver me safely into His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. 
2TI.4.21	Do all you can to come before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. 
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. 
TIT.1.1	Paul, a slave of God and an emissary of Messiah 
TIT.1.2	based on the hope of eternal life. God—who cannot lie—promised this before the beginning of time. 
TIT.1.3	But in His own time He made His message known, through a proclamation with which I was entrusted, by the command of God our Savior. 
TIT.1.4	To Titus, a true child of our common faith: Grace and 
TIT.1.5	The reason I left you in Crete was so that you would set in order the things that remain and appoint elders in every city as I directed you— 
TIT.1.6	if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children of faith with no charge of wild living or rebellion. 
TIT.1.7	For the overseer must be blameless as God’s administrator—not arrogant, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain. 
TIT.1.8	Rather he must be hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, upright, devout, disciplined. 
TIT.1.9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message in keeping with the teaching, so he can both encourage by instruction that is sound and convict those who speak against it. 
TIT.1.10	For there are many who are rebellious, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those from the circumcision. 
TIT.1.11	They must be silenced—those who upset entire households by teaching what they should not, for the sake of dishonest gain. 
TIT.1.12	One of them, one of their own prophets, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply, so they might be sound in the faith, 
TIT.1.14	not paying attention to Judaic myths and commands of men who turn away from the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To the pure all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Both their mind and conscience are defiled. 
TIT.1.16	They claim to know God but their deeds deny Him. They are despicable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.
TIT.2.1	But as for you, speak things that are fitting for sound instruction. 
TIT.2.2	Older men are to be clear-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in patience. 
TIT.2.3	Likewise, older women are to be sanctified in demeanor—not backbiting or enslaved to much wine. Let them be teachers of what is good, 
TIT.2.4	so that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	to be self-controlled, pure, managing their household, kind, submitted to their own husbands, so that God’s word may not be dishonored. 
TIT.2.6	Likewise urge the younger men to be self-controlled, 
TIT.2.7	in all things showing yourself to be an example of good deeds—integrity in instruction, dignity, 
TIT.2.8	sound speech beyond criticism—so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. 
TIT.2.9	Urge slaves to submit themselves to their own masters in all things, well-pleasing and not back-talking, 
TIT.2.10	not stealing but showing all good faithfulness, so that they may do credit to the teaching about God our Savior in everything. 
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 
TIT.2.12	training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age. 
TIT.2.13	We wait for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior, Messiah 
TIT.2.14	He gave Himself for us so that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and so that He might purify for Himself a chosen people, zealous for good deeds. 
TIT.2.15	So communicate these things, and encourage and correct with complete authority. Let no one look down on you.
TIT.3.1	Remind the people to be submitted to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed, 
TIT.3.2	to slander no one, without fighting, gentle, showing every courtesy to all people. 
TIT.3.3	For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deluded, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another. 
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared— 
TIT.3.5	not by deeds of righteousness which we had done ourselves, but because of His mercy— He saved us through the 
TIT.3.6	whom He abundantly poured out on us through Messiah 
TIT.3.7	so that being set right by His grace, we might become heirs with the confident hope of eternal life! 
TIT.3.8	Trustworthy is the saying, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people. 
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about 
TIT.3.10	Dismiss a quarrelsome person after a first and second warning, 
TIT.3.11	knowing that such a person is twisted and is sinning—he is self- condemned.
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to winter there. 
TIT.3.13	Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with great care, so that nothing is lacking for them. 
TIT.3.14	And let our people learn to devote themselves to doing 
TIT.3.15	All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Messiah 
PHM.1.2	To Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the community that meets in your house: 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and 
PHM.1.4	I thank my God always when mentioning you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	hearing of your love and the trust you have toward the Lord 
PHM.1.6	May the fellowship of your faith become effective, with the recognition of all the good that is ours in Messiah. 
PHM.1.7	For I’ve received much joy and comfort in your love, brother, because the hearts of the 
PHM.1.8	Therefore, though I have plenty of boldness in Messiah to order you to do what’s right, 
PHM.1.9	yet for love’s sake I appeal to you instead. I, Paul, am an old man and now also a prisoner belonging to Messiah 
PHM.1.10	I beg you for my child Onesimus—for whom I became a spiritual father while in chains. 
PHM.1.11	He once was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and me. 
PHM.1.12	I sent him back to you—he is my very heart. 
PHM.1.13	I really wanted to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he might serve me while I am in chains for the Good News. 
PHM.1.14	But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness wouldn’t be by force but by free will. 
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he was separated from you for a while in order that you might have him back forever, 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave but more than a slave—as a beloved brother, especially to me but even more so to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 
PHM.1.18	But if he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge that to my account. 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay. (Not to mention that you owe me your very self.) 
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Messiah.
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say. 
PHM.1.22	At the same time also, prepare a guest room for me—for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you. 
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Messiah 
PHM.1.24	So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 
PHM.1.25	May the grace of our Lord Messiah 
HEB.1.1	At many times and in many ways, God spoke long ago to the fathers through the prophets. 
HEB.1.2	In these last days He has spoken to us through a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things and through whom He created the universe. 
HEB.1.3	This Son is the radiance of His glory and the imprint of His being, upholding all things by His powerful word. When He had made purification for our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 
HEB.1.4	Thus He became as far above the angels as the name He has inherited is more excellent than theirs. 
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are My Son. Today I have become Your Father”? And again, “I will be to Him a Father, and He will be to Me a Son”? 
HEB.1.6	And again, when He brings the firstborn into the world, He says, “Let all the angels of God worship Him.” 
HEB.1.7	And regarding the angels He says, “He makes His angels winds, and His servants a flame of fire.” 
HEB.1.8	But regarding the Son He says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your Kingdom. 
HEB.1.9	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions.” 
HEB.1.10	And, “In the beginning, 
HEB.1.11	They shall pass away, but You remain. And they will all wear out like clothing. 
HEB.1.12	And like a robe You will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed; but You are the same, and Your years shall never end.” 
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels has He ever said, “Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”? 
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service to those about to inherit salvation? 
HEB.2.1	For this reason it is necessary for us to pay especially close attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken through angels proved to be firm, and every violation and disobedience received a just payback, 
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? It was first spoken through the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard. 
HEB.2.4	At the same time, God was testifying by signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the 
HEB.2.5	For it is not to angels that God has subjected the 
HEB.2.6	But somewhere someone has testified, saying, “What is man, that You are mindful of him, or the son of man, that You care for him? 
HEB.2.7	For a little while, You made him lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor. 
HEB.2.8	You put all things in subjection underneath his feet.” For when He put all things in subjection to him, He left nothing outside his control. But for now we do not yet see all things subjected to him. 
HEB.2.9	But we see One who was made for a little while lower than the angels—namely, 
HEB.2.10	For it was fitting for God—for whom and through whom all things exist—in leading many sons to glory, to perfect through sufferings the initiator of their salvation. 
HEB.2.11	For both He who sanctifies and those being sanctified are all from one—so He is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, 
HEB.2.12	saying, “I will proclaim Your name to My brothers and sisters. In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to You.” 
HEB.2.13	And again, “I will put My trust in Him.” And again, “Here am I and the children God has given Me.” 
HEB.2.14	Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared the same humanity—so that through death He might break the power of the one who had the power of death (that is, the devil) 
HEB.2.15	and free those who by fear of death were in bondage all their lives. 
HEB.2.16	For surely He is not concerned about angels, but about the seed of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore He had to be made like His brothers in all things, so He might become a merciful and faithful 
HEB.2.18	Because He Himself suffered when put to the test, He is able to help those being tested.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take notice of 
HEB.3.2	He was faithful to the One who appointed Him in His house—as was Moses also. 
HEB.3.3	For He has been considered worthy of more glory than Moses, even as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
HEB.3.5	Now Moses surely was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, for a witness of things to be spoken later. 
HEB.3.6	But Messiah, as Son, is over God’s house—and we are His house, if we hold firm to our boldness and what we are proud to hope.
HEB.3.7	Therefore, just as the 
HEB.3.8	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness. 
HEB.3.9	There your fathers put Me to the test, though they saw My works for forty years. 
HEB.3.10	Therefore I was provoked by this generation, and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways.’ 
HEB.3.11	As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest.’” 
HEB.3.12	Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief that falls away from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	But encourage one another day by day—as long as it is called “Today”—so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
HEB.3.14	For we have become partners of Messiah, if we hold our original conviction firm until the end. 
HEB.3.15	As it is said, “Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” 
HEB.3.16	Now which ones heard and rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt with Moses? 
HEB.3.17	And with whom was He provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest? Was it not to those who were disobedient? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they were not able to enter in because of lack of trust.
HEB.4.1	Let us fear then! Though a promise of entering His rest is left open, some of you would seem to have fallen short. 
HEB.4.2	For we also have had Good News proclaimed to us, just as they did. But the word they heard did not help them, because they were not unified with those who listened in faith. 
HEB.4.3	For we who have trusted are entering into that rest. It is just as God has said, “So in My wrath I swore, ‘They shall never enter My rest,’” even though His works were finished since the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works,” 
HEB.4.5	and again in this passage: “They shall never enter My rest.” 
HEB.4.6	So then it remains for some to enter into it; yet those who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them did not enter because of disobedience. 
HEB.4.7	Again, God appoints a certain day—“Today”—saying through David after so long a time, just as it has been said before, “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” 
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. 
HEB.4.9	So there remains a 
HEB.4.10	For the one who has entered God’s rest has also ceased from his own work, just as God did from His. 
HEB.4.11	Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall through the same pattern of disobedience. 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword—piercing right through to a separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	No creature is hidden from Him, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. 
HEB.4.14	Therefore, since we have a great 
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a 
HEB.4.16	Therefore let us draw near to the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help in time of need. 
HEB.5.1	For every 
HEB.5.2	He is able to empathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he himself also is subject to weakness. 
HEB.5.3	For this reason he has to make offerings for sins—just as for the people, so also for himself. 
HEB.5.4	And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when he is called by God, as Aaron was. 
HEB.5.5	So also Messiah did not glorify Himself to be made 
HEB.5.6	And He says in a different passage, “You are a 
HEB.5.7	In the days of His life on earth, 
HEB.5.8	Though He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered. 
HEB.5.9	And once made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him— 
HEB.5.10	called by God 
HEB.5.11	About this subject there is much for us to say, and it is hard to explain since you have become sluggish in hearing. 
HEB.5.12	For although you ought to be teachers by this time, again you need someone to teach you the basics of God’s sayings. You have come to need milk, not solid food. 
HEB.5.13	For anyone living on milk is inexperienced with the teaching about righteousness—he is an infant. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature, who through practice have their senses trained to discern both good and evil. 
HEB.6.1	Therefore leaving the basic teaching of the Messiah, let us move on toward maturity—not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of trust in God, 
HEB.6.2	of teaching about immersions, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	Now this we will do, if God permits. 
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible for those who once were enlightened—having tasted of the heavenly gift and become partakers of the 
HEB.6.5	and having tasted the good word of God and the powers of the 
HEB.6.6	and then having fallen away—to renew again to repentance, since they are again crucifying 
HEB.6.7	For the earth—having soaked up the rain frequently falling on it—brings forth vegetation useful to those for whom it is farmed; and it shares in God’s blessing. 
HEB.6.8	But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed—its end is to be burned over. 
HEB.6.9	But even though we speak like this, loved ones, concerning you we are convinced of better things—things coming with salvation. 
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love that you showed for His name, in having served and continuing to serve the 
HEB.6.11	But we long for each of you to show the same eagerness for the certainty of hope to the very end— 
HEB.6.12	so you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those inheriting the promises through trust and perseverance. 
HEB.6.13	Now when God made His promise to Abraham—since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, 
HEB.6.14	saying, “Surely I will bless you, and surely I will multiply you.” 
HEB.6.15	And so after waiting patiently, Abraham reached the promise. 
HEB.6.16	For people swear by someone greater; and the oath, as confirmation, is an end to all their disputing. 
HEB.6.17	In the same way God, determining to point out more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchanging nature of His purpose, guaranteed it with an oath. 
HEB.6.18	So by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us. 
HEB.6.19	We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, both firm and steady—a hope that enters the inner place behind the curtain. 
HEB.6.20	 has entered there as a forerunner on our behalf, having become 
HEB.7.1	For this 
HEB.7.2	and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything. First, by the translation of his name, he is “King of Righteousness”; and then also King of Salem, which is “King of 
HEB.7.3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like 
HEB.7.4	Now see how great this man is! Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth out of the plunder. 
HEB.7.5	Indeed, those sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have, according to 
HEB.7.6	But this one—who did not have their genealogy—has collected tithes from Abraham and has blessed him, the one holding the promises. 
HEB.7.7	Now it is beyond dispute that the lesser is blessed by the greater. 
HEB.7.8	In one case, dying men receive tithes; but in the other, one about whom it is testified that he lives on. 
HEB.7.9	Through Abraham even Levi, the one receiving tithes, has paid the tithe, so to speak— 
HEB.7.10	for he was still in his father’s loins when 
HEB.7.11	Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for based on it the people had been given the 
HEB.7.12	For whenever the priesthood is altered, out of necessity an alteration of law also takes place. 
HEB.7.13	For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For it is clear that our Lord has sprung forth from Judah—concerning this tribe, Moses said nothing about 
HEB.7.15	And it is even more evident, if another 
HEB.7.16	one made not by virtue of a 
HEB.7.17	For it is testified, “You are a 
HEB.7.18	For on the one hand, a former requirement is set aside because of its weakness and ineffectiveness— 
HEB.7.19	for 
HEB.7.20	Moreover, it was not without a sworn oath. (Others indeed have become 
HEB.7.21	but He with an oath—sworn by the One who said to Him, “
HEB.7.22	How much more then has 
HEB.7.23	Now on the one hand, many have become 
HEB.7.24	But on the other hand, the One who does remain forever has a permanent priesthood. 
HEB.7.25	Therefore He is also able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, always living to make intercession for them. 
HEB.7.26	For such a 
HEB.7.27	He has no need to offer up sacrifices day by day like those other 
HEB.7.28	For the 
HEB.8.1	Now here is the main point being said. We do have such a 
HEB.8.2	He is a priestly attendant of the Holies and the true Tent—which 
HEB.8.3	For every 
HEB.8.4	Now if He were on earth, He would not be a 
HEB.8.5	They offer service in a replica and foreshadower of the heavenlies—one that is just as Moses was instructed by God when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For He says, “See that you make everything according to the design that was shown to you on the mountain.” 
HEB.8.6	But now 
HEB.8.7	For if that first one had been faultless, there would not have been discourse seeking a second. 
HEB.8.8	For finding fault with them, He says, “Behold, days are coming, says 
HEB.8.9	It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not care for them, says 
HEB.8.10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says 
HEB.8.11	And no more will they teach, each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know 
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.” 
HEB.8.13	In saying “new,” He has treated the first as old; but what is being made old and aging is close to vanishing. 
HEB.9.1	Now even the first one had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary. 
HEB.9.2	For a tent was prepared: in the outer part were the 
HEB.9.3	Beyond the second curtain was a dwelling called the Holy of Holies. 
HEB.9.4	It held a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark was a golden jar holding the 
HEB.9.5	and above it, cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. But it is not now possible to speak in detail about these things. 
HEB.9.6	Now with these things prepared this way, the 
HEB.9.7	but into the inner, once a year, the 
HEB.9.8	By this the 
HEB.9.9	It is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly, gifts and sacrifices are being offered that cannot make the worshiper perfect with respect to conscience. 
HEB.9.10	These relate only to food and drink and various washings—regulations for the body imposed until a time of setting things straight. 
HEB.9.11	But when Messiah appeared as 
HEB.9.12	He entered into the Holies once for all—not by the blood of goats and calves but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. 
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, 
HEB.9.14	how much more will the blood of Messiah—who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God—cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 
HEB.9.15	For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that those called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—since a death has taken place that redeems them from violations under the first covenant. 
HEB.9.16	For where there is a covenant, the death of the one who made it must be established. 
HEB.9.17	For a covenant is secured upon the basis of dead bodies, since it has no strength as long as the one who made it lives. 
HEB.9.18	That is why not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. 
HEB.9.19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the 
HEB.9.20	He said, “This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you.” 
HEB.9.21	And in the same way, he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood. 
HEB.9.22	And nearly everything is purified in blood according to the 
HEB.9.23	Therefore it was necessary for the replicas of these heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices—but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Messiah did not enter into Holies made with hands—counterparts of the true things—but into heaven itself, now to appear in God’s presence on our behalf. 
HEB.9.25	And He did not offer Himself again and again—as the 
HEB.9.26	For then He would have needed to suffer again and again from the foundation of the world. But as it is, He has been revealed once and for all at the close of the ages—to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. 
HEB.9.27	And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this judgment, 
HEB.9.28	so also Messiah, was offered once to bear the sins of many. He will appear a second time, apart from sin, to those eagerly awaiting Him for salvation. 
HEB.10.1	The 
HEB.10.2	Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers—cleansed once and for all—would no longer have consciousness of sins? 
HEB.10.3	But in these sacrifices is a reminder of sins year after year— 
HEB.10.4	for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
HEB.10.5	So when Messiah comes into the world, He says, “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You prepared for Me. 
HEB.10.6	In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not delight. 
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Behold, I come to do Your will, O God (in the scroll of the book it is written of Me).’” 
HEB.10.8	After saying above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire, nor did You delight in them” (those which are offered according to 
HEB.10.9	then He said, “Behold, I come to do Your will.” He takes away the first to establish the second. 
HEB.10.10	By His will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Messiah 
HEB.10.11	Indeed, every 
HEB.10.12	But on the other hand, when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God— 
HEB.10.13	waiting from then on, until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet. 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering He has perfected forever those being made holy. 
HEB.10.15	The 
HEB.10.16	“This is the covenant that I will cut with them: ‘After those days,’ says 
HEB.10.17	“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” 
HEB.10.18	Now where there is removal of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
HEB.10.19	Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have boldness to enter into the Holies by the blood of 
HEB.10.20	He inaugurated a new and living way for us through the curtain—that is, His flesh. 
HEB.10.21	We also have a 
HEB.10.22	So let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and body washed with pure water. 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the unwavering confession of hope, for He who promised is faithful. 
HEB.10.24	And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good deeds. 
HEB.10.25	And do not neglect our own meetings, as is the habit of some, but encourage one another—and all the more so as you see the Day approaching. 
HEB.10.26	For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 
HEB.10.27	but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God. 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who rejected the 
HEB.10.29	How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled 
HEB.10.30	For we know the One who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,” and again, “
HEB.10.31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	But remember the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings. 
HEB.10.33	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to abuses and afflictions, and other times you became partners with those who were treated this way. 
HEB.10.34	For you suffered along with the prisoners and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession. 
HEB.10.35	Therefore, do not lose your boldness, which has great reward. 
HEB.10.36	For you need perseverance so that, after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise. 
HEB.10.37	For yet “in a very little while, the Coming One will come, and He will not delay. 
HEB.10.38	But My righteous one shall live by 
HEB.10.39	But we are not among the timid ones on the path to destruction, but among the faithful ones on the path to the preservation of the soul. 
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of realities not seen. 
HEB.11.2	For by it the elders received commendation. 
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen did not come from anything visible. 
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain. Through faith he was commended as righteous when God approved of his gifts. And through faith he still speaks, although he is dead. 
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was taken so as not to see death, and he was not found because God took him. For before he was taken, he was commended as pleasing to God. 
HEB.11.6	Now without faith it is impossible to please God. For the one who comes to God must believe that He exists and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, when warned about events not yet seen, in holy fear prepared an ark for the safety of his household. Through faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. 
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he was going. 
HEB.11.9	By faith he migrated to the land of promise as if it were foreign, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob—fellow heirs of the same promise. 
HEB.11.10	For he was waiting for the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 
HEB.11.11	By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive when she was barren and past the age, since she considered the One who had made the promise to be faithful. 
HEB.11.12	So from one—and him as good as dead—were fathered offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and as uncountable as the sand on the seashore. 
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith without receiving the things promised—but they saw them and welcomed them from afar, and they confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth. 
HEB.11.14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
HEB.11.15	If indeed they had been thinking about where they had come from, they would have had opportunity to return. 
HEB.11.16	But as it is, they yearn for a better land—that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them. 
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had received the promises was offering up his one and only son— 
HEB.11.18	the one about whom it was said, “Through Isaac offspring shall be named for you.” 
HEB.11.19	He reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead—and in a sense, he did receive him back from there. 
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come. 
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and he bowed in worship while leaning on the top of his staff. 
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the exodus of 
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was an extraordinary child and they were not afraid of the king’s decree. 
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. 
HEB.11.25	Instead he chose to suffer mistreatment along with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin. 
HEB.11.26	He considered the disgrace of Messiah as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt—because he was looking ahead to the reward. 
HEB.11.27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger—for he persevered as if seeing the One who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the Passover and the smearing of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them. 
HEB.11.29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as if on dry ground. When the Egyptians tried it, they were swallowed up. 
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were circled for seven days. 
HEB.11.31	By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she welcomed the spies with 
HEB.11.32	And what more shall I say? For time would fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets. 
HEB.11.33	By faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, and made foreign armies flee. 
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead raised back to life; and others were tortured, after not accepting release, so they might obtain a better resurrection. 
HEB.11.36	Others experienced the trial of mocking and scourging—yes, and even chains and prison. 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they were murdered with the sword. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins; they were destitute, afflicted, mistreated. 
HEB.11.38	The world was not worthy of them! They wandered around in deserts and mountains, caves and holes in the ground. 
HEB.11.39	And all these, though commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised— 
HEB.11.40	because God had provided something better for us, so that only with us would they reach perfection. 
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also get rid of every weight and entangling sin. Let us run with endurance the race set before us, 
HEB.12.2	focusing on 
HEB.12.3	Consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and lose heart. 
HEB.12.4	In struggling against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed. 
HEB.12.5	Have you forgotten the warning addressed to you as sons? “My son, do not take lightly the discipline of 
HEB.12.6	because 
HEB.12.7	It is for discipline that you endure. God is treating you as sons—for what son does a father not discipline? 
HEB.12.8	But if you are without discipline—something all have come to share—then you are illegitimate and not sons. 
HEB.12.9	Besides, we are used to having human fathers as instructors—and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? 
HEB.12.10	Indeed, for a short time they disciplined us as seemed best to them; but He does so for our benefit, so that we may share in His holiness. 
HEB.12.11	Now all discipline seems painful at the moment—not joyful. But later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. 
HEB.12.12	Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble! 
HEB.12.13	And make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be pulled out of joint but rather be healed. 
HEB.12.14	Pursue 
HEB.12.15	See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God; and see to it that no bitter root springs up and causes trouble, and by it many be defiled. 
HEB.12.16	Also see to it that there is no immoral or godless person—like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal. 
HEB.12.17	For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He found no chance for repentance, though he begged for it with tears.
HEB.12.18	For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and storm, 
HEB.12.19	and to the blast of a 
HEB.12.20	For they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.” 
HEB.12.21	So terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I am quaking with fear.” 
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion— to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, a joyous gathering, 
HEB.12.23	and to the assembly of the firstborn who are written in a scroll in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous ones made perfect, 
HEB.12.24	and to 
HEB.12.25	See to it that you do not refuse the One who is speaking! For if they did not escape when they refused the One who was warning them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject the One who warns us from heaven. 
HEB.12.26	His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.” 
HEB.12.27	Now this phrase, “Yet once more,” shows the removal of those things that are shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain. 
HEB.12.28	Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude—through this we may offer worship in a manner pleasing to God, with reverence and awe. 
HEB.12.29	For our God is a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love continue. 
HEB.13.2	Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers—for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it. 
HEB.13.3	Remember the prisoners as if you were fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you also were suffering bodily. 
HEB.13.4	Let marriage be held in honor among all and the marriage bed kept undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers. 
HEB.13.5	Keep your lifestyle free from the love of money, and be content with what you have. For God Himself has said, “I will never leave you or forsake you,” 
HEB.13.6	so that with confidence we say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What will man do to me?” 
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. 
HEB.13.8	 the Messiah is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 
HEB.13.9	Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace—not by foods that have not benefited those occupied by them. 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those serving in the tabernacle have no right to eat. 
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those animals—whose blood is brought into the Holies by the 
HEB.13.12	Therefore, to make the people holy through His own blood, 
HEB.13.13	So let us go to Him outside the camp, bearing His disgrace. 
HEB.13.14	For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the one that is to come. 
HEB.13.15	Through 
HEB.13.16	Do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. 
HEB.13.17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as ones who must give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no benefit to you. 
HEB.13.18	Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things. 
HEB.13.19	I especially urge you to do this, so that I may be restored to you sooner.
HEB.13.20	Now may the God of 
HEB.13.21	make you complete in every good thing to do His will, accomplishing in us what is pleasing in His sight, through Messiah 
HEB.13.22	But I urge you, brothers and sisters, listen patiently to this word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you in few words. 
HEB.13.23	Know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon, I will visit you with him. 
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all the 
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all.
JAS.1.1	Jacob, a slave of God and of the Lord 
JAS.1.2	Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, 
JAS.1.3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 
JAS.1.4	And let endurance have its perfect work, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 
JAS.1.5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all without hesitation and without reproach; and it will be given to him. 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, without any doubting—for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord— 
JAS.1.8	he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 
JAS.1.9	But let the brother in humble circumstances boast in his high position— 
JAS.1.10	and the rich person in his humble position, because like the flower of the grass he will pass away. 
JAS.1.11	For the sun arises with a scorching heat and withers the grass, and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed. So also the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will wither away. 
JAS.1.12	Happy is the one who endures testing, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love Him. 
JAS.1.13	Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”—for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He himself tempts no one. 
JAS.1.14	But each one is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own desire. 
JAS.1.15	Then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is full grown, it brings forth death. 
JAS.1.16	Do not be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. 
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow. 
JAS.1.18	By His will, He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all He created. 
JAS.1.19	Know this, my dear brothers and sisters: let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger— 
JAS.1.20	for human anger doesn’t produce the righteousness of God. 
JAS.1.21	So put away all moral filth and excess of evil and receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 
JAS.1.22	But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding yourselves. 
JAS.1.23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror— 
JAS.1.24	for once he looks at himself and goes away, he immediately forgets what sort of person he was. 
JAS.1.25	But the one who looks intently into the perfect 
JAS.1.26	If anyone thinks he is religious and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is futile. 
JAS.1.27	Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
JAS.2.1	My brothers and sisters, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord 
JAS.2.2	For if a man with a gold ring and fine clothes comes into your synagogue, and a poor person in filthy clothes also comes in; 
JAS.2.3	and you pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothing and you say, “Sit here in a good place”; and you say to the poor person, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”; 
JAS.2.4	haven’t you made distinctions between yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? 
JAS.2.5	Listen, my dear brothers and sisters. Didn’t God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom that He promised to those who love Him? 
JAS.2.6	But you have dishonored the poor person. Isn’t it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? 
JAS.2.7	Don’t they blaspheme the good name by which you were called? 
JAS.2.8	If, however, you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well. 
JAS.2.9	But if you show favoritism, you are committing sin and are convicted by the 
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the whole 
JAS.2.11	For the one who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not commit murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the 
JAS.2.12	So speak and act as those who will be judged according to a 
JAS.2.13	For judgment is merciless to the one who does not show mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. 
JAS.2.14	What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone says he has faith, but does not have works? Can such faith save him? 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you says to them, “Go in 
JAS.2.17	So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself. 
JAS.2.18	But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith without works and I will show you faith by my works. 
JAS.2.19	You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe—and shudder! 
JAS.2.20	But do you want to know, you empty person, that faith without works is dead? 
JAS.2.21	Wasn’t Abraham our father proved righteous by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	You see that faith worked together with his works, and by the works his faith was made complete. 
JAS.2.23	The Scripture was fulfilled that says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness”—and he was called God’s friend. 
JAS.2.24	You see that a man is proved righteous by works and not by faith alone. 
JAS.2.25	And likewise, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also proved righteous by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out another way? 
JAS.2.26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
JAS.3.1	Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, since you know that we will receive a stricter judgment. 
JAS.3.2	For we all stumble in many ways. If someone does not stumble in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well. 
JAS.3.3	And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole body as well.
JAS.3.4	See also the ships—though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. 
JAS.3.5	So also the tongue is a small member—yet it boasts of great things. See how so small a fire sets a blaze so great a forest! 
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is a world of evil placed among our body parts. It pollutes the whole body and sets on fire the course of life—and is set on fire by Gehenna. 
JAS.3.7	For every species of beasts and birds, reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 
JAS.3.8	But no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
JAS.3.9	With it we bless our 
JAS.3.10	From the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, these things should not be. 
JAS.3.11	A spring doesn’t pour out fresh and bitter water from the same opening, does it? 
JAS.3.12	My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Neither can salt water produce fresh water.
JAS.3.13	Who among you is wise and understanding? By his good conduct let him show his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth. 
JAS.3.15	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
JAS.3.16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil practice. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, not hypocritical. 
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in 
JAS.4.1	Where do quarrels and conflicts among you come from? Don’t they come from this, namely your passions that battle within your body parts? 
JAS.4.2	You crave and have not. You murder and you envy, yet you cannot get it. You fight and you wage war. You do not have because you do not ask. 
JAS.4.3	You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives so you may spend it on your passions. 
JAS.4.4	You adulteresses! Don’t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Or do you think that in vain the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit which He made to dwell in us”? 
JAS.4.6	But He gives greater grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” 
JAS.4.7	Therefore submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded! 
JAS.4.9	Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into gloom. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of 
JAS.4.11	Do not speak evil against one another, brethren. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the 
JAS.4.12	There is only one lawgiver and judge—the One who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you who judges your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.” 
JAS.4.14	Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes. 
JAS.4.15	Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 
JAS.4.17	Therefore whoever knows the right thing to do and does not do it—for him it is sin.
JAS.5.1	Come now, you rich, weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you. 
JAS.5.2	Your riches have rotted and your clothes have become moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and your silver have rusted and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days. 
JAS.5.4	Behold, the wages of the workers who mowed your fields—which you kept back by fraud—are crying out against you. And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts. 
JAS.5.5	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous person—he does not resist you. 
JAS.5.7	So be patient, brothers and sisters, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until it receives the early and late rain. 
JAS.5.8	You also be patient. Strengthen your hearts because the coming of the Lord is near. 
JAS.5.9	Do not grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be judged. Behold, the judge is standing at the doors. 
JAS.5.10	As an example of suffering and patience, brothers and sisters, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	Behold, we consider blessed those who showed endurance. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the outcome of 
JAS.5.12	But above all, my dear brothers and sisters, do not swear—either by heaven, or by the earth, or by any other oath. But let your “yes” be “yes,” and your “no,” be “no”—so that you may not fall under judgment.
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praises. 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of Messiah’s community, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.15	The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 
JAS.5.16	So confess your offenses to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous person is very powerful. 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain. And it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. 
JAS.5.18	He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit. 
JAS.5.19	My brothers and sisters, if any among you strays from the truth and someone turns him back, 
JAS.5.20	let him know that the one who turns a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins. 
1PE.1.1	Peter, an emissary of Messiah 
1PE.1.2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, set apart by the 
1PE.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord 
1PE.1.4	An incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance has been reserved in heaven for you. 
1PE.1.5	By trusting, you are being protected by God’s power for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1PE.1.6	You rejoice in this greatly, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials. 
1PE.1.7	These trials are so that the true metal of your faith (far more valuable than gold, which perishes though refined by fire) may come to light in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Messiah 
1PE.1.8	Though you have not seen Him, you love Him. And even though you don’t see Him now, you trust Him and are filled with a joy that is glorious beyond words, 
1PE.1.9	receiving the outcome of your faith—the salvation of your souls. 
1PE.1.10	The prophets, who spoke about the grace that was to be yours, searched for this salvation and investigated carefully. 
1PE.1.11	They were trying to find out the time and circumstances the 
1PE.1.12	It was revealed to them that they were providing these messages not to themselves but to you. These messages have now been announced to you through those who proclaimed the Good News to you by the 
1PE.1.13	So brace your minds for action. Keep your balance. And set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of 
1PE.1.14	Like obedient children, do not be shaped by the cravings you had formerly in your ignorance. 
1PE.1.15	Instead, just like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in everything you do. 
1PE.1.16	For it is written, “Kedoshim you shall be, for I am 
1PE.1.17	If you call on Him as Father—the One who judges impartially according to each one’s deeds—then live out the time of sojourning in reverent fear. 
1PE.1.18	You know that you were redeemed from the futile way of life handed down from your ancestors—not with perishable things such as silver or gold, 
1PE.1.19	but with precious blood like that of a lamb without defect or spot, the blood of Messiah. 
1PE.1.20	He was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. 
1PE.1.21	Through Him you are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your trust and hope are in God. 
1PE.1.22	Now that you have purified your souls in obedience to the truth, leading to sincere brotherly love, love one another fervently from a pure heart. 
1PE.1.23	You have been born again—not from perishable seed but imperishable—through the living and enduring word of God. 
1PE.1.24	For, “All humanity is like grass, And all its glory like a wildflower. The grass withers, and the flower falls off, 
1PE.1.25	But the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that was proclaimed as Good News to you. 
1PE.2.1	So get rid of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all 
1PE.2.2	As newborn babes, long for pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow toward salvation— 
1PE.2.3	now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. 
1PE.2.4	As you come to Him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen by God and precious, 
1PE.2.5	you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house—a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Messiah 
1PE.2.6	For it says in Scripture, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen, precious cornerstone. Whoever trusts in Him will never be put to shame.” 
1PE.2.7	Now the value is for you who keep trusting; but for those who do not trust, “The stone which the builders rejected— this One has become the chief cornerstone,” 
1PE.2.8	and “a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.” They stumble because they are disobeying the word—to this they were also appointed. 
1PE.2.9	But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the praises of the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. 
1PE.2.10	Once you were “not a people,” but now you are “God’s people.” You were shown “no mercy,” but now you have been shown “mercy.” 
1PE.2.11	Loved ones, I urge you as strangers and sojourners to keep away from the fleshly cravings that war against the soul. 
1PE.2.12	Keep your conduct honorable among the Gentiles. Then while they speak against you as evildoers, they may—from noticing your good deeds—glorify God in the day of visitation.
1PE.2.13	For the Lord’s sake, submit yourselves to every human authority—whether to a king as supreme, 
1PE.2.14	or to governors sent by him for the punishment of those who do evil and the praise of those who do good. 
1PE.2.15	For this is God’s will, that you silence the ignorance of foolish men by doing good. 
1PE.2.16	Live as free people, but not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil. Rather, live as God’s slaves. 
1PE.2.17	Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. 
1PE.2.18	Slaves, with all respect submit yourselves to your masters—not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are harsh. 
1PE.2.19	For this finds favor if, for the sake of conscience toward God, someone endures grief from suffering undeservedly. 
1PE.2.20	For what credit is there if, when you sin and get a beating, you endure? But if you endure when you do good and suffer for it, this finds favor with God. 
1PE.2.21	For you were called to this, because Messiah also suffered for you, leaving you an example so that you might follow in His footsteps: 
1PE.2.22	“He committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth.” 
1PE.2.23	When He was abused, He did not return the abuse. While suffering, He made no threats. Instead, He kept entrusting Himself to the One who judges righteously. 
1PE.2.24	He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that we, removed from sins, might live for righteousness. “By His wounds you were healed.” 
1PE.2.25	For you like sheep were going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls. 
1PE.3.1	Likewise, wives, be submitted to your own husbands so that—even if some do not obey the message—by the wives’ conduct, without a word they may be won over 
1PE.3.2	as they observe your pure, reverent conduct. 
1PE.3.3	Don’t let your beauty be external—braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes. 
1PE.3.4	Instead let it be in the hidden person of the heart, with the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s sight is very precious. 
1PE.3.5	For this is the way the holy women, who put their hope in God, used to beautify themselves long ago—being submitted to their own husbands 
1PE.3.6	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You have become her daughters by doing what is good and not fearing intimidation. 
1PE.3.7	In the same way, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way. Though they are weaker partners, honor them as equal heirs of the grace of life. In this way, your prayers will not be hindered.
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, tenderhearted, humble-minded. 
1PE.3.9	Do not repay evil for evil or insult for insult, but give a blessing instead—it is for this reason you were called, so that you might inherit a blessing. 
1PE.3.10	For, “The one who loves life, wanting to see good days, must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit. 
1PE.3.11	He must turn away from evil and do good. He must seek 
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of 
1PE.3.13	Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. Do not be afraid or worry about their threats. 
1PE.3.15	Instead sanctify Messiah as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, 
1PE.3.16	yet with humility and reverence—keeping a clear conscience so that, whatever you are accused of, those who abuse you for your good conduct in Messiah may be put to shame. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better to suffer for doing good (if it is God’s will) than for doing evil. 
1PE.3.18	For Messiah once suffered for sins also—the righteous for the unrighteous—in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the 
1PE.3.19	Through the 
1PE.3.20	Long ago they disobeyed while God kept waiting patiently, in the days of Noah as the ark was being built. In that ark a few (that is, eight souls) were brought safely through water. 
1PE.3.21	Corresponding to that, immersion now brings you to safety—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but a pledge to God of a good conscience—through the resurrection of Messiah 
1PE.3.22	He has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers subjected to Him. 
1PE.4.1	Therefore, since Messiah suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same attitude. For the one who has suffered in the flesh is finished with sin. 
1PE.4.2	As a result, he lives the rest of his time in the flesh no longer for human desires, but for God’s will. 
1PE.4.3	For the time that has passed was sufficient for you to carry out the desire of the pagans—living in indecency, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, wild parties, and lawless idolatries. 
1PE.4.4	They are surprised that you do not run with them into the same riot of recklessness, and they vilify you. 
1PE.4.5	But they will have to give an account to the One who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For this was the reason the Good News was proclaimed even to those now dead, so that though they are judged in the flesh before humans, they might live in the 
1PE.4.7	Now the end of all things is near. So be self-controlled and sober-minded for prayer. 
1PE.4.8	Above all, keep your love for one another constant, for “love covers a multitude of sins.” 
1PE.4.9	Be hospitable one to another without grumbling. 
1PE.4.10	As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of the many-sided grace of God. 
1PE.4.11	Whoever speaks, let it be as one speaking the utterances of God. Whoever serves, let it be with the strength that God supplies. So in all things may God be glorified through Messiah 
1PE.4.12	Loved ones, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal taking place among you to test you—as though something strange were happening to you. 
1PE.4.13	Instead, rejoice insofar as you share in the sufferings of Messiah, so that at the revelation of His glory you may also rejoice and be glad. 
1PE.4.14	If you are insulted for the name of Messiah, you are fortunate, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 
1PE.4.15	For let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or evildoer or as a troublemaker. 
1PE.4.16	But if anyone suffers for following Messiah, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name. 
1PE.4.17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God. If judgment begins with us first, what will be the end for those who disobey the Good News of God? 
1PE.4.18	Now, “if it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what shall become of the ungodly and the sinner?” 
1PE.4.19	So then, those who suffer according to God’s will—let them trust their souls to a faithful Creator while continuing to do good.
1PE.5.1	Therefore I appeal to the elders among you—as a fellow elder and witness of Messiah’s sufferings, and a partaker also of the glory about to be revealed— 
1PE.5.2	shepherd God’s flock among you. Watch over it not under compulsion but willingly before God, not for dishonest gain but eagerly. 
1PE.5.3	Don’t lord it over those apportioned to you, but become examples to the flock. 
1PE.5.4	When the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 
1PE.5.5	Likewise, you younger ones, submit yourselves to the elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” 
1PE.5.6	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may lift you up at the appropriate time. 
1PE.5.7	Cast all your worries on Him, for He cares for you. 
1PE.5.8	Stay alert! Watch out! Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, searching for someone to devour. 
1PE.5.9	Stand up against him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being laid upon your brothers and sisters throughout the world. 
1PE.5.10	After you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace—who has called you into His eternal glory in Messiah—will Himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you. 
1PE.5.11	All power to Him forever! Amen. 
1PE.5.12	Through Silvanus, whom I consider our faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! 
1PE.5.13	Messiah’s community in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings. So does my son Mark. 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of love. 
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a slave and emissary of Messiah 
2PE.1.2	May grace and 
2PE.1.3	His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and virtue. 
2PE.1.4	Through these things He has given us His precious and magnificent promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, since you have escaped the corruption that evil desires have brought into the world. 
2PE.1.5	Now for this very reason, making every effort, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; 
2PE.1.6	and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, patience; and to patience, godliness; 
2PE.1.7	and to godliness, brotherly love; and to brotherly love, love. 
2PE.1.8	For if these qualities are in you and increasing, they keep you from becoming idle and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord 
2PE.1.9	But anyone who lacks these qualities is blind—nearsighted because he has forgotten his cleansing from past sins. 
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brothers and sisters, make all the more effort to make your calling and election certain—for if you keep doing these things, you will never stumble. 
2PE.1.11	For in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Messiah 
2PE.1.12	Therefore I intend to keep reminding you of these things, even though you know them and are well-grounded in the truth that you have. 
2PE.1.13	I think it right to stir you up with a reminder, as long as I remain alive in this “tent” of a body—
2PE.1.14	knowing that my death is soon, as our Lord 
2PE.1.15	And I will make every effort for you to always remember these things even after my departure.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cleverly concocted tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord 
2PE.1.17	For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, a voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory: “This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased!” 
2PE.1.18	And we ourselves heard this voice come out of heaven, when we were with Him on the holy mountain. 
2PE.1.19	Furthermore, we have the reliable prophetic word. You do well by paying attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 
2PE.1.20	Above all understand this: no prophecy of Scripture comes about from a person’s own interpretation. 
2PE.1.21	For no prophecy was ever brought forth by human will; rather, people spoke from God as they were moved by the 
2PE.2.1	But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you. They will secretly bring in destructive heresies. They will even deny the Master who bought them—bringing swift destruction upon themselves. 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their immoral ways, and as a result the way of the truth will be maligned. 
2PE.2.3	In their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. 
2PE.2.4	For God did not spare angels when they sinned, but threw them into 
2PE.2.5	He did not spare the ancient world. He preserved only Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, along with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly. 
2PE.2.6	He devastated the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, reducing them to ashes—making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly. 
2PE.2.7	He rescued Lot, a righteous man deeply troubled by the shameless immorality of the wicked. 
2PE.2.8	(For that righteous man, while living among them, was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by lawless deeds he saw and heard.) 
2PE.2.9	Therefore the Lord certainly knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and how to keep the unrighteous being punished until the Day of Judgment—
2PE.2.10	especially those who follow after the flesh in its unclean desires and who despise the Lord’s authority. Brazen and arrogant, these people do not tremble while slandering glorious beings; 
2PE.2.11	yet even angels, though stronger and more powerful, do not bring a slanderous charge against them before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	But these people are like irrational animals—creatures of instinct born to be captured and killed. They malign what they don’t understand, and in their destruction they will be utterly destroyed. 
2PE.2.13	They will be paid back for what they have done—evil for evil. They consider carousing in broad daylight a pleasure. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceitful pleasures while feasting together with you. 
2PE.2.14	They have eyes full of adultery that never stop sinning, enticing unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed—a cursed brood! 
2PE.2.15	They have abandoned the straight way. They have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness. 
2PE.2.16	But he received a rebuke for his own wrongdoing. A dumb donkey spoke with a man’s voice and put a stop to the prophet’s madness. 
2PE.2.17	These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. The gloom of utter darkness has been reserved for them. 
2PE.2.18	For by mouthing grandiosities that amount to nothing, they entice in sensual fleshly passions those who are barely escaping from those who live in error. 
2PE.2.19	They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption—for a person is a slave to whatever has overcome him. 
2PE.2.20	For if—after escaping the world’s pollutions through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, 
2PE.2.21	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after learning about it, to turn back from the holy commandment passed on to them. 
2PE.2.22	What has happened to them confirms the truth of the proverb, “A dog returns to its vomit,” and “A scrubbed pig heads right back into the mud.”
2PE.3.1	Loved ones, this is now the second letter that I am writing to you. In both I am trying to stir you up by way of a reminder to wholesome thinking— 
2PE.3.2	to remember the words previously proclaimed by the holy prophets and the commandment of our Lord and Savior through your emissaries. 
2PE.3.3	First of all, understand that in the last days, scoffers will come scoffing, following after their own desires 
2PE.3.4	and saying, “Where is this promise of His coming? Ever since the fathers died, everything goes on just as it has from the beginning of creation.” 
2PE.3.5	For in holding to this idea, it escapes their notice that the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God. 
2PE.3.6	Through these, the world of that time was destroyed by being flooded with water. 
2PE.3.7	But by the same word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire—kept until the Day of Judgment and the destruction of ungodly people. 
2PE.3.8	But don’t forget this one thing, loved ones, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. 
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some consider slowness. Rather, He is being patient toward you—not wanting anyone to perish, but for all to come to repentance. 
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements will melt and disintegrate, and the earth and everything done on it shall be exposed. 
2PE.3.11	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? Live your lives in holiness and godliness, 
2PE.3.12	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God. In that day the heavens will be dissolved by fire, and the elements will melt in the intense heat. 
2PE.3.13	But in keeping with His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
2PE.3.14	Therefore, loved ones, while you are looking for these things, make every effort to be found in 
2PE.3.15	Bear in mind that the patience of our Lord means salvation—just as our dearly loved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom given to him. 
2PE.3.16	He speaks about these matters in all of his letters. Some things in them are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist (as they also do with the rest of the Scriptures)—to their own destruction. 
2PE.3.17	Since you already know all this, loved ones, be on your guard so that you are not led astray by the error of the lawless and lose your sure footing. 
2PE.3.18	Instead, keep growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior 
1JN.1.1	What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of life—
1JN.1.2	the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us. 
1JN.1.3	What we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so you may have fellowship with us. Indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and His Son, 
1JN.1.4	These things we write so our joy may be full.
1JN.1.5	Now this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you—that God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
1JN.1.6	If we say we have fellowship with Him and keep walking in the darkness, we are lying and do not practice the truth. 
1JN.1.7	But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of His Son 
1JN.1.8	If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 
1JN.1.10	If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. 
1JN.2.1	My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Intercessor with the Father—the righteous Messiah 
1JN.2.2	He is the atonement for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.
1JN.2.3	Now we know that we have come to know Him by this—if we keep His commandments. 
1JN.2.4	The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
1JN.2.5	But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God is truly made perfect. We know that we are in Him by this— 
1JN.2.6	whoever claims to abide in Him must walk just as He walked.
1JN.2.7	Loved ones, I am not writing a new commandment for you, but an old commandment—one you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word you have heard. 
1JN.2.8	Yet I am writing a new commandment for you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining. 
1JN.2.9	The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness. 
1JN.2.10	The one who loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. 
1JN.2.11	But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness. He doesn’t know where he is going, because the darkness has made his eyes blind. 
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name. 
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. 
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
1JN.2.16	For everything in the world—the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the boasting of life—is not from the Father but from the world. 
1JN.2.17	The world is passing away along with its desire, but the one who does the will of God abides forever.
1JN.2.18	Children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that the anti-messiah is coming, even now many anti-messiahs have come—by this we know that it is the last hour. 
1JN.2.19	They left us, but they didn’t really belong to us. If they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they left us so it became clear that none of them belongs to us. 
1JN.2.20	But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 
1JN.2.21	I have not written you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that 
1JN.2.23	No one who denies the Son has the Father; the one who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 
1JN.2.24	As for you, let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will continue to live in the Son and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	Now this is the promise that He Himself has promised us—eternal life. 
1JN.2.26	I have written you these things about those who are trying to mislead you. 
1JN.2.27	As for you, the anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all things—and it is true and not a lie—and just as it has taught you, abide in Him. 
1JN.2.28	And now, children, abide in Him, so that when He appears we will have confidence and not be ashamed in His presence at His coming.
1JN.2.29	If you know that He is righteous, you also know that everyone who does what is right is born of Him. 
1JN.3.1	See how glorious a love the Father has given us, that we should be called God’s children—and so we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him. 
1JN.3.2	Loved ones, now we are God’s children; and it has not yet been revealed what we will be. But we do know that when it’s revealed, we shall be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. 
1JN.3.3	Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. 
1JN.3.4	Everyone practicing sin also practices lawlessness—indeed, sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	You know that 
1JN.3.6	No one who abides in Him keeps on sinning; no one who sins has seen Him or known Him. 
1JN.3.7	Children, let no one mislead you! The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as 
1JN.3.8	The one who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. 
1JN.3.9	No one born of God practices sin, because God’s seed remains in him. He cannot sin, because he is born of God.
1JN.3.10	It is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil by this—anyone who does not act righteously or love his brother is not of God. 
1JN.3.11	For this is the message you have heard from the beginning—we should love one another. 
1JN.3.12	Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, while his brother’s were righteous. 
1JN.3.13	Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. 
1JN.3.15	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer—and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 
1JN.3.16	We have come to know love by this—
1JN.3.17	But if someone has material possessions and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? 
1JN.3.18	Children, let us not love with word or talk, but in deed and truth! 
1JN.3.19	By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and set our heart at rest before Him 
1JN.3.20	whenever our heart condemns us. For God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 
1JN.3.21	Loved ones, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 
1JN.3.22	and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do what is pleasing in His sight. 
1JN.3.23	Now this is His commandment—that we should believe in the name of His Son, 
1JN.3.24	The one who keeps His commandments abides in God, and God in him. We know that He abides in us by this—by the Spirit He has given us.
1JN.4.1	Loved ones, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	You know the 
1JN.4.3	but every spirit that does not acknowledge 
1JN.4.4	You are from God, children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	They are from the world, so they speak from the world and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	We are from God; whoever knows God listens to us, but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.7	Loved ones, let us love one another, for love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	The love of God was revealed among us by this—that God sent His one and only Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 
1JN.4.10	This is love—not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atonement for our sins. 
1JN.4.11	Loved ones, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God abides in us and His love is made perfect in us. 
1JN.4.13	We know that we abide in Him and He in us by this—because He has given us of His Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son as Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	If anyone acknowledges that 
1JN.4.16	So we have come to know and trust in the love that God has for us. God is love. Now whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 
1JN.4.17	In this way, love is made perfect among us, so that we should have boldness on the Day of Judgment. For just as He is, so also are we in this world. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and the one who fears has not been made perfect in love. 
1JN.4.19	We love, because He first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 
1JN.4.21	And this commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God should also love his brother. 
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that 
1JN.5.2	We know that we love God’s children by this—when we love God and obey His commandments. 
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God—that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. 
1JN.5.4	For everyone born of God overcomes the world. And the victory that has overcome the world is this—our faith. 
1JN.5.5	Who is it that overcomes the world, if not the one who believes that 
1JN.5.6	Messiah 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that testify— 
1JN.5.8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are one. 
1JN.5.9	If we accept men’s testimony, God’s testimony is greater—for this it is the testimony that God has given about His Son. 
1JN.5.10	The one who trusts in 
1JN.5.11	And the testimony is this—that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 
1JN.5.12	The one who has the Son has life; the one who does not have 
1JN.5.13	I wrote these things to you who believe in the name of 
1JN.5.14	Now this is the confidence we have before Him—that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that He hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have the requests we have asked from Him. 
1JN.5.16	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and God will give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death—I am not saying you should ask about that. 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin not leading to death. 
1JN.5.18	We know that anyone born of God does not keep on sinning; rather, the One born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot touch him. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 
1JN.5.20	And we know that 
1JN.5.21	Children, guard yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.1	The elder. To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I alone, but also all who have come to know the truth— 
2JN.1.2	because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: 
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, and 
2JN.1.4	I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we received as a commandment from the Father. 
2JN.1.5	Now I ask you, dear lady, that we love one another. It is not as though I am writing you a new command, but the one we have had from the beginning. 
2JN.1.6	Now this is love: that we walk according to His commands. This is the commandment—just as you heard from the beginning—that you walk in love. 
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world—those who do not acknowledge 
2JN.1.8	Watch yourselves, so you do not lose what we have worked for but receive a full reward. 
2JN.1.9	Anyone who goes too far and does not remain in Messiah’s teaching does not have God. Anyone who remains in this teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not welcome him into your home or even give him a greeting. 
2JN.1.11	For the one greeting him shares in his evil deeds. 
2JN.1.12	Although I have much to write to you, I don’t want to do it with paper and ink. But I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be full. 
2JN.1.13	The children of your chosen sister send you greetings. 
3JN.1.1	The elder. To Gaius the loved one, whom I love in truth: 
3JN.1.2	Loved ones, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, just as it is well with your soul. 
3JN.1.3	For I was overjoyed when some brethren came and testified of the truth in you—how you are walking in truth. 
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than this—to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
3JN.1.5	Loved ones, you are acting faithfully in whatever you do for the brethren and especially for strangers. 
3JN.1.6	They have testified to your love before Messiah’s community. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. 
3JN.1.7	For on behalf of the Name they went out, accepting nothing from the pagans. 
3JN.1.8	Therefore we ought to support such people, so we might become co-workers in the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote something to Messiah’s community, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn’t welcome us. 
3JN.1.10	So if I do come, I will call attention to what he is doing—slandering us with wicked words. Not even content with that, he refuses to welcome the brethren, and even forbids those who want to do so— throwing them out of the community! 
3JN.1.11	Loved ones, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God. 
3JN.1.12	Demetrius has a good testimony from everyone, even from the truth itself. We also vouch for him—and you know that our testimony is true. 
3JN.1.13	I have much to write you, but I don’t want to write to you with ink and pen. 
3JN.1.14	But I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face. 
3JN.1.15	. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
JUD.1.1	Judah, a slave of 
JUD.1.2	May mercy and 
JUD.1.3	Loved ones, though very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I felt it necessary to write to you urging you to continue to contend for the faith that was once for all handed down to the 
JUD.1.4	For certain people have secretly slipped in—those who from long ago have been marked out for this judgment. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into indecency and deny our only Master and Lord, 
JUD.1.5	Now I wish to remind you—though you have come to know all things —that the Lord, once having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 
JUD.1.6	And the angels—who did not keep their own position of authority but deserted their proper place—He has kept in everlasting shackles under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great Day. 
JUD.1.7	In the same way as these angels, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them—having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after a different sort of flesh—are displayed as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire. 
JUD.1.8	Yet in the same way these people also, by their visionary dreaming, defile the flesh, reject the Lord’s authority, and defame glorious beings. 
JUD.1.9	But when Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, was arguing about the body of Moses, he did not dare to render a judgment against him for slander, but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!” 
JUD.1.10	But these people slander whatever they do not understand. And whatever they do understand instinctively—like animals without reason—by these things they are destroyed. 
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! For they went the way of Cain; they were consumed for pay in Balaam’s error; and in Korah’s rebellion they have been destroyed. 
JUD.1.12	These people are hidden rocky reefs at your love feasts—shamelessly feasting with you, tending only to themselves. They are waterless clouds, carried along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, doubly dead, uprooted; 
JUD.1.13	wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever. 
JUD.1.14	It was also about these people that Enoch, the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His 
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment against all. He will convict all the ungodly for all their ungodly deeds that they have done in an ungodly way, and for all of the harsh things ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.” 
JUD.1.16	These are bellyaching grumblers, following after their own desires. Their mouth speaks grandiose things, showing favoritism for the sake of gain. 
JUD.1.17	But you, loved ones, ought to remember the words previously proclaimed by the emissaries of our Lord 
JUD.1.18	how they kept telling you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following after their own ungodly desires.” 
JUD.1.19	These are the ones who cause divisions—worldly-minded, not having the 
JUD.1.20	But you, loved ones, continue building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the 
JUD.1.21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, eagerly waiting for the mercy of our Lord 
JUD.1.22	And have mercy on those who are wavering—
JUD.1.23	save them by snatching them out of the fire; but on others have mercy with fear—hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.
JUD.1.24	Now to the One who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you blameless before the presence of His glory with great joy, 
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Savior, through 
REV.1.1	The revelation of 
REV.1.2	who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of 
REV.1.3	How fortunate is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and those who hear and keep what has been written in it—for the time is near. 
REV.1.4	John, To Messiah’s seven communities in Asia: Grace to you and 
REV.1.5	and from Messiah 
REV.1.6	and made us a kingdom, 
REV.1.7	“Look, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, even those who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him. Yes, amen!” 
REV.1.8	“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says 
REV.1.9	I, John, your brother and fellow partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are in 
REV.1.10	I was in the 
REV.1.11	saying, “Write what you see in a scroll, and send it to Messiah’s seven communities—to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”
REV.1.12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned, I saw seven golden 
REV.1.13	In the midst of the 
REV.1.14	His head and His hair were white like wool, white like snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire. 
REV.1.15	His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the roar of rushing waters. 
REV.1.16	In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came forth a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at full strength. 
REV.1.17	When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. But He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid! I am the First and the Last, 
REV.1.18	and the One who lives. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever! Moreover, I hold the keys of death and 
REV.1.19	Therefore write down what you have seen, what is, and what will happen after these things. 
REV.1.20	As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden 
REV.2.1	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Ephesus write: “Thus says the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks in the midst of the seven golden 
REV.2.2	I know all about your deeds and your toil and your patient endurance, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. You have tested those who call themselves emissaries and are not, and have found them to be liars. 
REV.2.3	You have perseverance and have endured for My name’s sake, and you have not grown weary. 
REV.2.4	“But this I have against you, that you have forsaken your first love. 
REV.2.5	Remember then from where you have fallen. Repent and do the deeds you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your 
REV.2.6	“Yet you have this going for you, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
REV.2.7	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.2.8	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Smyrna write: “Thus says the First and Last, who was dead and came to life. 
REV.2.9	I know your tribulation and your poverty (yet you are rich), as well as the slander of those who say they are Jewish and are not, but are a synagogue of satan. 
REV.2.10	Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, so that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. 
REV.2.11	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.2.12	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Pergamum write: “Thus says the One who has the sharp two-edged sword: 
REV.2.13	I know where you live—where satan’s throne is. Yet you continue to hold firm to My name, and you did not deny your faith in Me even in the days of Antipas, My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where satan resides. 
REV.2.14	“But I have a few things against you. You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who was teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before 
REV.2.15	Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
REV.2.16	Repent then! If not, I will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of My mouth. 
REV.2.17	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.2.18	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Thyatira write: “Thus says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like polished bronze: 
REV.2.19	I know your deeds and your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your last deeds are greater than the first. 
REV.2.20	“But this I have against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess—yet she is teaching and deceiving My servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
REV.2.21	I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her immorality. 
REV.2.22	Behold, I will throw her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation—unless they repent of her doings. 
REV.2.23	I will also strike her children with a deadly disease. Then all of Messiah’s communities will know that I am the One who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your deeds. 
REV.2.24	“But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold to this teaching and have not learned the so-called ‘deep things’ of satan—I place on you no other burden. 
REV.2.25	Only hold firm to what you have until I come. 
REV.2.26	To the one who overcomes and guards My deeds until the end, ‘I will give him authority over the nations 
REV.2.27	and he shall rule them with an iron rod, as when clay pots are broken into pieces.’ 
REV.2.28	Even as I have received from My Father, so I will give him the morning star. 
REV.2.29	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.3.1	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Sardis write: “Thus says the One having the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your deeds—you have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead. 
REV.3.2	Wake up, and strengthen what remains that was about to die. For I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of My God. 
REV.3.3	So remember what you have received and heard—keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you. 
REV.3.4	“But still, you have a few people in Sardis who have not stained their clothes. They will walk with Me in white, because they are worthy. 
REV.3.5	The one who overcomes thus will be dressed in white clothes; I will never blot his name out of the Book of Life, and will confess his name before My Father and His angels. 
REV.3.6	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.3.7	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Philadelphia write: “Thus says the Holy One, the True One, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens: 
REV.3.8	I know your deeds. Behold, I have set before you an open door that no one is able to shut—because you have little power, but you have kept My word and have not denied My name. 
REV.3.9	Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of satan—who say they are Jewish and are not, but lie—behold, I will cause them to come and bow down before your feet, so that they acknowledge that I have loved you! 
REV.3.10	“Because you have kept My word about patient endurance, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is coming upon the whole world to test those who dwell on the earth. 
REV.3.11	I am coming soon—hold on to what you have, so that no one will take away your crown. 
REV.3.12	The one who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the Temple of My God, and he will never leave it. And on him I will write the name of My God and the name of the city of My God—the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God—and My own new Name. 
REV.3.13	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.3.14	To the angel of Messiah’s community in Laodicea write: “Thus says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Originator of God’s creation: 
REV.3.15	I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. Oh, that you were either cold or hot! 
REV.3.16	So because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spew you out of My mouth. 
REV.3.17	For you say, ‘I am rich, I have made myself wealthy, and I need nothing.’ But you do not know that you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked. 
REV.3.18	I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich, and white clothes so that you may dress yourself and so the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed, and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see. 
REV.3.19	Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline. Therefore, be zealous and repent. 
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me. 
REV.3.21	To the one who overcomes I will grant the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I myself overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. 
REV.3.22	He who has an ear, let him hear what the 
REV.4.1	After these things I looked, and behold, a door was standing open in heaven. And the first voice, which I had heard speaking with me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.” 
REV.4.2	Immediately I was in the 
REV.4.3	And the One who was seated was like jasper and carnelian in appearance, and a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance. 
REV.4.4	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders dressed in white clothes with golden crowns on their heads. 
REV.4.5	And out from the throne come flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder—and seven torches of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. 
REV.4.6	And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal. In the middle of the throne and around it were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind. 
REV.4.7	The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 
REV.4.8	The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes all around and within. They do not rest day or night, chanting, “
REV.4.9	And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the One seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever. And they throw their crowns down before the throne, chanting, 
REV.4.11	“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, For You created all things, and because of Your will they existed and were created!”
REV.5.1	And I saw in the right hand of the One seated upon the throne a scroll, written on both the front and the back, sealed with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?” 
REV.5.3	No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it. 
REV.5.4	I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. 
REV.5.5	Then one of the elders tells me, “Stop weeping! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed—He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
REV.5.6	And in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as having been slain—having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. 
REV.5.7	He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne. 
REV.5.8	When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense—which are the prayers of the 
REV.5.9	And they are singing a new song, saying, “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals. For You were slain, and by Your blood You redeemed for God those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. 
REV.5.10	You have made them for our God a kingdom and 
REV.5.11	Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders—their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands. 
REV.5.12	They were chanting with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!” 
REV.5.13	And I heard every creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and everything in them, responding, “To the One seated on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power forever and ever!” 
REV.5.14	And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen!” And the elders fell down and worshiped.
REV.6.1	Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!” 
REV.6.2	I looked, and behold, there was a white horse. The one riding on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him. He went out as a conqueror so he might conquer. 
REV.6.3	When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	Then another horse came out, fiery red. The one riding on it was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another. He was given a great sword. 
REV.6.5	When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” And behold, I saw a black horse. The one riding on it held a balance scale in his hand. 
REV.6.6	Then I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius—but do no harm to the oil and wine!” 
REV.6.7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	Behold, I saw a horse, pale greenish gray. The name of the one riding on it was Death, and 
REV.6.9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slaughtered for the sake of the word of God and for the witness they had. 
REV.6.10	And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “O Sovereign Master, holy and true, how long before You judge those who dwell on the earth and avenge our blood?” 
REV.6.11	Then a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants was complete—their brothers and sisters who were to be killed as they had been. 
REV.6.12	I saw when the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as black as sackcloth made of goat’s hair, and the full moon became like blood. 
REV.6.13	The stars of heaven fell to the earth like a fig tree drops unripe figs when shaken by a great wind. 
REV.6.14	The heaven ripped apart like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from their places. 
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the military commanders and the rich and the mighty and everyone—slave and free—hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 
REV.6.16	And they tell the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. 
REV.6.17	For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”
REV.7.1	After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or against any tree. 
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who were permitted to harm the earth and the sea, 
REV.7.3	saying, “Do no harm to the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” 
REV.7.4	Now I heard the number of those marked with the seal: 144,000 from every tribe of 
REV.7.5	12,000 from the tribe of Judah; 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben; 12,000 from the tribe of Gad; 
REV.7.6	12,000 from the tribe of Asher; 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali; 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh; 
REV.7.7	12,000 from the tribe of Simeon; 12,000 from the tribe of Levi; 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar; 
REV.7.8	12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun; 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph; 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin. 
REV.7.9	After these things I looked, and behold, a vast multitude that no one could count—from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues—was standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands 
REV.7.10	and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” 
REV.7.11	And all the angels were standing around the throne, along with the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	saying, “Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might belong to our God forever and ever. Amen!” 
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these dressed in white robes, and where have they come from?” I said to him, “Sir, you know.” 
REV.7.14	Then he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	For this reason, they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His Temple. The One seated on the throne will shelter them. 
REV.7.16	They shall never again go hungry, nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat. 
REV.7.17	For the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and guide them to springs of living water, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	Now when the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
REV.8.2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 
REV.8.3	Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden incense burner. He was given much incense to offer up along with the prayers of all the 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the 
REV.8.5	Then the angel took the incense burner and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there were clashes of thunder and rumblings and flashes of lightning and earthquakes. 
REV.8.6	Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. 
REV.8.7	The first trumpeted, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown upon the earth. A third of the earth burned up, a third of the trees burned up, and all the green grass burned up. 
REV.8.8	The second angel trumpeted, and something like a huge mountain ablaze with fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 
REV.8.9	a third of the creatures living in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
REV.8.10	The third angel trumpeted, and a great star fell from the heavens, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. 
REV.8.11	Now the name of the star is Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters that were made bitter. 
REV.8.12	The fourth angel trumpeted, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day would not shine, as well as a third of the night. 
REV.8.13	Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying out with a loud voice as it flew high in the sky, saying, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpets the three angels are about to sound!”
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth. The key to the bottomless pit was given to him. 
REV.9.2	He opened the pit, and smoke rose from the pit like the smoke of a gigantic furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit. 
REV.9.3	Then from the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them like the scorpions have power over the earth. 
REV.9.4	They were told to do no harm to the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	And they were permitted not to kill them, but to torment them for five months—and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person. 
REV.9.6	In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them. 
REV.9.7	Now the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces. 
REV.9.8	They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. 
REV.9.9	They had chests like iron breastplates; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle. 
REV.9.10	They have tails like scorpions with stingers; and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months. 
REV.9.11	They have as king over them the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon. 
REV.9.12	The first woe is past. Behold, two woes are still coming after these things. 
REV.9.13	The sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a single voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God. 
REV.9.14	It said to the sixth angel, the one holding the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 
REV.9.15	So the four angels—who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year—were released to kill a third of mankind. 
REV.9.16	The number of mounted troops was two hundred million—I heard their number. 
REV.9.17	Now here is how I saw the horses and those riding on them: they had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and brimstone. 
REV.9.18	By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone that came out of their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads by which they inflict injuries. 
REV.9.20	But the rest of mankind, those not killed by these plagues, did not repent and turn away from the works of their hands—they would not stop worshiping demons and the idols of gold and silver and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. 
REV.9.21	And they did not repent and turn away from their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their stealing.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire. 
REV.10.2	He had in his hand a little scroll that was open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, 
REV.10.3	and he cried out with a loud voice, just as a lion roars. When he cried out, the seven thunders spoke. 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said. Do not write it down!” 
REV.10.5	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven 
REV.10.6	and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay. 
REV.10.7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel—when he is about to trumpet—the mystery of God is completed, just as He declared to His servants the prophets. 
REV.10.8	Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.” 
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll. And he tells me, “Take and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.” 
REV.10.10	So I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth; but when I had swallowed it, my stomach was made bitter. 
REV.10.11	And they tell me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”
REV.11.1	Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, “Get up and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count those worshiping in it. 
REV.11.2	But do not measure the court outside the Temple—leave it out, because it has been given to the nations, and they shall trample the holy city for forty-two months. 
REV.11.3	And I will grant authority to My two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.” 
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees and the two 
REV.11.5	If anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies. If anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 
REV.11.6	These two have the power to shut the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying. And they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish. 
REV.11.7	When they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them, and overcome them and kill them. 
REV.11.8	And their corpses will lie in the open street of the great city that figuratively is called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified. 
REV.11.9	Some from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, not allowing them to be placed into a grave. 
REV.11.10	Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them. They will celebrate and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth. 
REV.11.11	But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet; and great fear fell on those who were watching them. 
REV.11.12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them. 
REV.11.13	At that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 
REV.11.14	The second woe is past. The third woe is coming soon.
REV.11.15	Then the seventh angel trumpeted, and there were loud voices in heaven saying, “The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Anointed One. And He shall reign forever and ever!” 
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders seated on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying, “We thank you, 
REV.11.18	The nations were enraged, but Your wrath has come and the time for the dead to be judged— to reward Your servants, the prophets and 
REV.11.19	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant appeared in His Temple. And there were flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder and an earthquake and heavy hail. 
REV.12.1	A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. 
REV.12.2	She is pregnant—crying out in birth pains, in agony to give birth. 
REV.12.3	Then another sign appeared in heaven: a great fiery red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns, and seven royal crowns on his heads. 
REV.12.4	His tail sweeps away a third of the stars of heaven—it hurled them to the earth. Now the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that whenever she gave birth he might devour her child. 
REV.12.5	And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was snatched away to God and to His throne. 
REV.12.6	Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God so they might take care of her for 1,260 days. 
REV.12.7	And war broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels making war against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought, 
REV.12.8	but they were not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. 
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was thrown down—the ancient serpent, called the devil and satan, who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Anointed One, for the accuser of our brothers and sisters—the one who accuses them before our God day and night—has been thrown out. 
REV.12.11	They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives even in the face of death. 
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great rage, knowing that his time is short. 
REV.12.13	Now when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth, he stalked the woman who had given birth to the male child. 
REV.12.14	But the woman was given two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly away from the presence of the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is taken care of—for a time, times, and half a time. 
REV.12.15	And from out of his mouth, the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman, in order to sweep her away with a flood. 
REV.12.16	But the earth came to the aid of the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth. 
REV.12.17	So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring—those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of 
REV.12.18	And he stood on the shore of the sea. 
REV.13.1	Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea, that had ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten royal crowns, and upon his heads were slanderous names. 
REV.13.2	Now the beast that I saw was like a leopard, his feet like a bear’s, and his mouth like a lion’s. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. 
REV.13.3	One of his heads seemed to have been slain, but the fatal wound was healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast. 
REV.13.4	And they worshiped the dragon, because he had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast, chanting, “Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him?” 
REV.13.5	The beast was given a mouth uttering great boasts and blasphemies. It was given authority to act for forty-two months. 
REV.13.6	Then he opened his mouth with blasphemies against God, to slander His name and His tabernacle—that is, those dwelling in heaven. 
REV.13.7	He was also permitted to make war against the 
REV.13.8	All who dwell on the earth shall worship him—everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb who was slain. 
REV.13.9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 
REV.13.10	If anyone is meant for captivity, to captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed by the sword, by the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and faith of the 
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. 
REV.13.12	He exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and he makes the earth and all those who dwell in it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	He performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. 
REV.13.14	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth through the signs he is permitted to perform, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image in honor of the beast who has the sword wound yet lived. 
REV.13.15	The second beast was permitted to give life to the image of the first beast, so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause all who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 
REV.13.16	He also causes all—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave—to receive a mark on their right hand or upon their forehead. 
REV.13.17	And so no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark—either the name of the beast or the number of his name. 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is a number of a man, and his number is 666. 
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him were 144,000 who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and the booming of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like harpists playing on their harps. 
REV.14.3	And they are singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one is able to learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 
REV.14.4	These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been redeemed from among mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb. 
REV.14.5	And in their mouth was found no lie—they are blameless. 
REV.14.6	And then I saw another angel flying high in the sky, having a timeless message of good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation and tribe and tongue and people. 
REV.14.7	He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the One who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water.” 
REV.14.8	Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great— she who made all nations drink of the wine of the fury of her immorality.” 
REV.14.9	And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	he shall also drink the wine of God’s fury, poured full strength into the cup of His wrath. And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. Those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of his name have no rest day or night.” 
REV.14.12	Here is the perseverance of the 
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: How fortunate are the dead—those who die in the Lord from now on!” “Yes,” says the 
REV.14.14	Then I looked, and behold, there was a white cloud—and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man. He had a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand. 
REV.14.15	Then another angel came out of the Temple, crying out with a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud, “Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.” 
REV.14.16	So the One seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. 
REV.14.17	Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	Then another angel—the one who has authority over fire—came out from the altar; and he called out with a loud voice to the one holding the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sickle and gather the grape clusters from the vineyard of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.” 
REV.14.19	So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the clusters from the vineyard of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God. 
REV.14.20	And the winepress was stomped on outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as a horse’s bridle for 1,600 stadia.
REV.15.1	Then I saw another great and wonderful sign in heaven: seven angels who have seven plagues—the last ones, for with them God’s wrath is finished. 
REV.15.2	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name standing by the sea of glass, holding the harps of God. 
REV.15.3	And they are singing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and wonderful are Your deeds, 
REV.15.4	Who shall not fear and glorify Your name, O Lord? For You alone are Holy. All the nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been revealed!” 
REV.15.5	After these things I looked, and the Temple of the Tent of Witness in heaven was opened. 
REV.15.6	Out of the Temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, dressed in pure bright linen and wearing wide gold sashes around their chests. 
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 
REV.15.8	And the Temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power. No one was able to enter the Temple until the seven angels’ seven plagues were finished. 
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the Temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath.” 
REV.16.2	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and foul and painful boils came upon the people having the mark of the beast and worshiping his image. 
REV.16.3	Next the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a corpse; and every living thing in the sea died. 
REV.16.4	Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. 
REV.16.5	Then I heard the angel of the waters saying, “Righteous are You—the Holy One, who is and who was— because You have passed these judgments. 
REV.16.6	For they have poured out the blood of 
REV.16.7	Then I heard the altar saying, “Yes, 
REV.16.8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was permitted to scorch people with fire. 
REV.16.9	People were scorched with fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God—the One who has power over these plagues. But they did not repent, to give Him glory. 
REV.16.10	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in pain 
REV.16.11	and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their boils. But they did not repent of their deeds. 
REV.16.12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl over the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east. 
REV.16.13	Then I saw—coming from the dragon’s mouth and from the beast’s mouth and from the false prophet’s mouth—three unclean spirits like frogs. 
REV.16.14	For they are demonic spirits performing miraculous signs, who go out to the kings of the whole world—to gather them for battle on the great Day of 
REV.16.15	“Behold, I am coming like a thief! How fortunate is the one who stays alert and keeps his clothes on, lest he walk around naked and they see his shamefulness.” 
REV.16.16	Then the spirits gathered the kings to the place called in Hebrew Har-Megiddo. 
REV.16.17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came out of the Temple from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 
REV.16.18	And there were flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder and a great earthquake—such as never happened since mankind has been on the earth, so mighty was the quake. 
REV.16.19	Then the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to force her to drink the cup of the wine of His furious wrath. 
REV.16.20	Every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. 
REV.16.21	Enormous hail—about a hundred pounds each—falls from heaven on the people. And the people cursed God because of the plague of hail—so extreme was that plague.
REV.17.1	Then one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the sentencing of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters. 
REV.17.2	The earth’s kings committed sexual immorality with her, and those who dwell on the earth got drunk with the wine of her immorality.” 
REV.17.3	So he carried me away in the 
REV.17.4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls. She was holding a golden cup in her hand full of detestable things and the filth of her immorality, 
REV.17.5	and on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of prostitutes and the detestable things of the earth.” 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the 
REV.17.7	But the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.8	The beast that you saw was, and is not, and yet is about to rise up from the abyss and head for destruction. Those who dwell on the earth—whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world—will be astonished when they see the beast, because he was and is not and is to come. 
REV.17.9	“This calls for a mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings— 
REV.17.10	five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. 
REV.17.11	The beast that was and is not—he himself is the eighth, and is one of the seven, and is heading for destruction. 
REV.17.12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour. 
REV.17.13	These kings are of one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	They will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them—because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful.” 
REV.17.15	Then he tells me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. 
REV.17.16	The ten horns that you saw, and the beast—these will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God has put it into their hearts to do His will, and to be of one mind, and to give their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	And the woman that you saw is the great city exercising kingship over the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory. 
REV.18.2	He cried out with a mighty voice, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a den for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit and for every unclean bird and for every unclean and detestable beast. 
REV.18.3	For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her immorality. The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich off the power of her self-indulgence.” 
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you participate in her sins and receive her plagues! 
REV.18.5	For her sins have piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. 
REV.18.6	Pay her back just as she has paid out, and give her back double for her deeds! In the cup she has mixed— mix a double dose for her! 
REV.18.7	As she has exalted herself and indulged herself in luxury, so give her the same measure of torment and grief! For in her heart she says, ‘I sit as a queen— I am no widow; I shall never see grief.’ 
REV.18.8	For this reason her plagues will arrive in a single day— death and grief and famine— and she shall be burned down with fire. For mighty is 
REV.18.9	Then the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and indulged in luxury with her shall weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning—
REV.18.10	standing far off because of the terror of her torment, saying: “Alas, alas, O great city— O Babylon, the mighty city! For in a single hour your judgment has come!” 
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, because no one buys their merchandise anymore— 
REV.18.12	shipments of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of citron wood; all kinds of ivory products; all kinds of products made of costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble; 
REV.18.13	cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine, oil, fine flour, and wheat; cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots; and slaves—that is, human souls. 
REV.18.14	The fruit of your soul’s desire has gone from you, and all the expensive and beautiful things are lost to you —never again will people find them. 
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, shall stand far off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, 
REV.18.16	saying, “Alas, alas, O great city— clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls! 
REV.18.17	For in a single hour so much wealth has been ruined!” And every ship captain and passenger, sailors and all who make their living at sea, stood at a distance 
REV.18.18	and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What city is like the great city?’ 
REV.18.19	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, “Alas, alas, O great city— in her all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth! For in a single hour has she been ruined! 
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you 
REV.18.21	Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying: “So shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, never to be found again! 
REV.18.22	And the sound of harpists and musicians, flautists and trumpeters, shall never be heard in you again! And the craftsman of any craft shall never be found in you again! And the sound of a mill shall never be heard in you again! 
REV.18.23	And the light of a lamp shall never shine in you again! And the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again! For your businessmen were the tycoons of the world, for all the nations were deceived by your sorcery! 
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of the prophets and 
REV.19.1	After these things, I heard something like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, shouting: “Halleluyah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God. 
REV.19.2	For His judgments are true and just. For He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her whoring, and has avenged the blood of His servants caused by her hand.” 
REV.19.3	And a second time they shouted, “Halleluyah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever!” 
REV.19.4	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, “Amen! Halleluyah!” 
REV.19.5	Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you His servants and all who fear Him, both the small and the great!” 
REV.19.6	Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude—like the roar of rushing waters or like the rumbling of powerful thunder—saying, “Halleluyah! For 
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready, 
REV.19.8	She was given fine linen to wear, bright and clean! For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the 
REV.19.9	Then the angel tells me, “Write: How fortunate are those who have been invited to the wedding banquet of the Lamb!” He also tells me, “These are the true words of God.” 
REV.19.10	Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But he said to me, “See that you do not do that—for I am only a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of 
REV.19.11	Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The One riding on it is called Faithful and True, and He judges and makes war in righteousness. 
REV.19.12	His eyes are like a flame of fire, and many royal crowns are on His head. He has a name written that no one knows except Himself. 
REV.19.13	He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which He is called is “the Word of God.” 
REV.19.14	And the armies of heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	From His mouth comes a sharp sword—so that with it He may strike down the nations—and He shall rule them with an iron rod, and He treads the winepress of the furious wrath of 
REV.19.16	On His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, “King of kings, and Lord of lords.” 
REV.19.17	Then I saw a single angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he cried out to all the birds flying high in the sky, “Come, gather for the great banquet of God— 
REV.19.18	to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and those riding on them, the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great!” 
REV.19.19	Also I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the One who sat on the horse and against His army. 
REV.19.20	Then the beast was captured, and along with him the false prophet who had performed the signs before him by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, as well as those who had worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. 
REV.19.21	The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the One riding on the horse. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.
REV.20.1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a great chain. 
REV.20.2	He seized the dragon—the ancient serpent, who is the devil and satan—and bound him for a thousand years. 
REV.20.3	He also threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed. After these things, he must be released for a short while. 
REV.20.4	Then I saw thrones, and people sat upon them—those to whom authority to judge was given. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for 
REV.20.5	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	How fortunate and holy is the one who has a share in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no authority, but they shall be 
REV.20.7	When the thousand years has ended, satan shall be released from his prison, 
REV.20.8	and he shall come out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea. 
REV.20.9	And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the 
REV.20.10	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they shall be tortured day and night forever and ever. 
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white throne, and the One seated on it. The earth and heaven fled from His presence, but no place was found for them. 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead—the great and the small—standing before the throne. The books were opened, and another book was opened—the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what was written in the books, according to their deeds. 
REV.20.13	The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and 
REV.20.14	Then death and 
REV.20.15	And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. 
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. 
REV.21.2	I also saw the holy city—the New Jerusalem—coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
REV.21.3	I also heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the dwelling of God is among men, and He shall tabernacle among them. They shall be His people, and God Himself shall be among them and be their God. 
REV.21.4	He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more. Nor shall there be mourning or crying or pain any longer, for the former things have passed away.” 
REV.21.5	And the One seated upon the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new!” Then He said, “Write, for these words are trustworthy and true.” 
REV.21.6	Then He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will freely give from the spring of the water of life. 
REV.21.7	The one who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 
REV.21.8	But for the cowardly and faithless and detestable and murderers and sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars—their lot is in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”
REV.21.9	Then came one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues, and he spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	Then he carried me away in the 
REV.21.11	having the glory of God—her radiance like a most precious stone, like a jasper, sparkling like crystal. 
REV.21.12	She had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and above the gates twelve angels. On the gates were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of 
REV.21.13	three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve emissaries of the Lamb. 
REV.21.15	The angel speaking with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and walls. 
REV.21.16	The city is laid out as a square—its length the same as its width. He measured the city with the rod—12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal. 
REV.21.17	He also measured its wall—144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel’s measurement. 
REV.21.18	The material of the city’s wall was jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundations of the city wall were decorated with every kind of precious stone—the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
REV.21.20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, carnelian; the seventh, yellow topaz; the eighth; beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls—each of the gates was from a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass. 
REV.21.22	I saw no temple in her, for its Temple is 
REV.21.23	And the city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God lights it up, and its lamp is the Lamb. 
REV.21.24	The nations shall walk by its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. 
REV.21.25	Its gates shall never be shut by day, for there shall be no night there! 
REV.21.26	And they shall bring into it the glory and honor of the nations. 
REV.21.27	And nothing unholy shall ever enter it, nor anyone doing what is detestable or false, but only those written in the Book of Life. 
REV.22.1	Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life—bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
REV.22.2	down the middle of the city’s street. On either side of the river was a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 
REV.22.3	No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in the city, and His servants shall serve Him. 
REV.22.4	They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	Night shall be no more, and people will have no need for lamplight or sunlight—for 
REV.22.6	He said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true! 
REV.22.7	Behold, I am coming soon! How fortunate is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.” 
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel showing me these things. 
REV.22.9	But he tells me, “See that you do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets and those keeping the words of this book. Worship God!” 
REV.22.10	Then he tells me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. 
REV.22.11	Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do righteousness, and the holy still be holy. 
REV.22.12	Behold, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me, to pay back each one according to his deeds. 
REV.22.13	“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. 
REV.22.14	How fortunate are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the Tree of Life and may enter through the gates into the city. 
REV.22.15	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. 
REV.22.16	I, 
REV.22.17	The 
REV.22.18	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book. If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 
REV.22.19	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his share in the Tree of Life and the Holy City, which are written in this book. 
REV.22.20	The One giving testimony to these things says, “Yes! I am coming soon!” Amen! Come, Lord 
REV.22.21	May the grace of the Lord
