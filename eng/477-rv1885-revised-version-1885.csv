GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
GEN.1.2	And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
GEN.1.3	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
GEN.1.6	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 
GEN.1.7	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 
GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
GEN.1.9	And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 
GEN.1.10	And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, 
GEN.1.12	And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
GEN.1.14	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: 
GEN.1.15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
GEN.1.16	And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: 
GEN.1.17	And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
GEN.1.18	and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 
GEN.1.21	And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kinds, and every winged fowl after its kind: and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
GEN.1.23	And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
GEN.1.24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind: and it was so. 
GEN.1.25	And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
GEN.1.27	And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
GEN.1.29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat: 
GEN.1.30	and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, 
GEN.1.31	And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 
GEN.2.2	And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
GEN.2.3	And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it: because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.
GEN.2.4	These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the 
GEN.2.5	And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up: for the 
GEN.2.6	but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 
GEN.2.7	And the 
GEN.2.8	And the 
GEN.2.9	And out of the ground made the 
GEN.2.10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
GEN.2.12	and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 
GEN.2.13	And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 
GEN.2.15	And the 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
GEN.2.18	And the 
GEN.2.19	And out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found an help meet for him.
GEN.2.21	And the 
GEN.2.22	and the rib, which the 
GEN.2.23	And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 
GEN.2.24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the 
GEN.3.2	And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat: 
GEN.3.3	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 
GEN.3.4	And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 
GEN.3.5	for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
GEN.3.6	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. 
GEN.3.7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
GEN.3.8	And they heard the voice of the 
GEN.3.9	And the 
GEN.3.10	And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
GEN.3.11	And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 
GEN.3.12	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 
GEN.3.13	And the 
GEN.3.14	And the 
GEN.3.15	and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
GEN.3.16	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
GEN.3.17	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 
GEN.3.18	thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 
GEN.3.19	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
GEN.3.20	And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
GEN.3.21	And the 
GEN.3.22	And the 
GEN.3.23	therefore the 
GEN.3.24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with 
GEN.4.2	And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
GEN.4.3	And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the 
GEN.4.4	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the 
GEN.4.5	but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
GEN.4.6	And the 
GEN.4.7	If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
GEN.4.8	And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
GEN.4.9	And the 
GEN.4.10	And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 
GEN.4.11	And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 
GEN.4.12	when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
GEN.4.13	And Cain said unto the 
GEN.4.14	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that whosoever findeth me shall slay me. 
GEN.4.15	And the 
GEN.4.16	And Cain went out from the presence of the 
GEN.4.17	And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 
GEN.4.18	And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael: and Methushael begat Lamech.
GEN.4.19	And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and 
GEN.4.21	And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. 
GEN.4.22	And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me: 
GEN.4.24	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, 
GEN.4.26	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the 
GEN.5.1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 
GEN.5.2	male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 
GEN.5.3	And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat 
GEN.5.4	and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
GEN.5.6	And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enosh: 
GEN.5.7	and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.8	and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 
GEN.5.9	And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan: 
GEN.5.10	and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.11	and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 
GEN.5.12	And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel: 
GEN.5.13	and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.14	and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. 
GEN.5.15	And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 
GEN.5.16	And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.17	and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 
GEN.5.18	And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch: 
GEN.5.19	and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
GEN.5.21	And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 
GEN.5.22	and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.23	and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 
GEN.5.24	and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
GEN.5.25	And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech: 
GEN.5.26	and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.27	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
GEN.5.28	And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 
GEN.5.29	and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us for our work and for the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the 
GEN.5.30	And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 
GEN.5.31	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 
GEN.5.32	And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them, 
GEN.6.2	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
GEN.6.3	And the 
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men which were of old, the men of renown. 
GEN.6.5	And the 
GEN.6.6	And it repented the 
GEN.6.7	And the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
GEN.6.9	These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, 
GEN.6.10	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
GEN.6.13	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
GEN.6.15	And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 
GEN.6.16	A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 
GEN.6.17	And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; every thing that is in the earth shall die. 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 
GEN.6.20	Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 
GEN.6.21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
GEN.6.22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
GEN.7.1	And the 
GEN.7.2	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female; 
GEN.7.3	of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female: to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 
GEN.7.4	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.
GEN.7.5	And Noah did according unto all that the 
GEN.7.6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 
GEN.7.7	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the ground, 
GEN.7.9	there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 
GEN.7.12	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
GEN.7.14	they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every sort. 
GEN.7.15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. 
GEN.7.16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and the 
GEN.7.17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. 
GEN.7.20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
GEN.7.21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, and beast, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 
GEN.7.22	all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 
GEN.7.23	And every living thing was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. 
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; 
GEN.8.2	the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 
GEN.8.3	and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of an hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
GEN.8.4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
GEN.8.6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 
GEN.8.7	and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 
GEN.8.8	And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 
GEN.8.9	but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. 
GEN.8.10	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
GEN.8.11	and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
GEN.8.12	And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.
GEN.8.13	And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried. 
GEN.8.14	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
GEN.8.15	And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
GEN.8.17	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both fowl, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
GEN.8.18	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 
GEN.8.19	every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.
GEN.8.20	And Noah builded an altar unto the 
GEN.8.21	And the 
GEN.8.22	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
GEN.9.2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. 
GEN.9.4	But flesh with the life thereof, 
GEN.9.5	And surely your blood, 
GEN.9.6	Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 
GEN.9.7	And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
GEN.9.8	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
GEN.9.9	And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 
GEN.9.11	And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
GEN.9.12	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
GEN.9.13	I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, 
GEN.9.15	and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
GEN.9.16	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 
GEN.9.17	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
GEN.9.18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread. 
GEN.9.20	And Noah began to be an husbandman, and planted a vineyard: 
GEN.9.21	and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
GEN.9.23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
GEN.9.24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. 
GEN.9.25	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 
GEN.9.26	And he said, Blessed be the 
GEN.9.27	God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
GEN.9.28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
GEN.9.29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
GEN.10.1	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem Ham and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
GEN.10.5	Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue; after their families, in their nations.
GEN.10.6	And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
GEN.10.11	Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 
GEN.10.12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city). 
GEN.10.13	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
GEN.10.14	and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; 
GEN.10.16	and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 
GEN.10.17	and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; 
GEN.10.18	and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
GEN.10.21	And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	And the sons of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
GEN.10.24	And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber. 
GEN.10.25	And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
GEN.10.26	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; 
GEN.10.27	and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; 
GEN.10.28	and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; 
GEN.10.29	and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
GEN.11.2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
GEN.11.3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top 
GEN.11.5	And the 
GEN.11.6	And the 
GEN.11.7	Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the 
GEN.11.10	These are the generations of Shem. Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood: 
GEN.11.11	and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.12	And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah: 
GEN.11.13	and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.14	And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 
GEN.11.15	and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.16	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 
GEN.11.17	and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.18	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 
GEN.11.19	and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.20	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
GEN.11.21	and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.22	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
GEN.11.23	and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 
GEN.11.25	and Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.26	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
GEN.11.28	And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 
GEN.11.29	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	And Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
GEN.11.31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
GEN.11.32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Now the 
GEN.12.2	and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing: 
GEN.12.3	and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
GEN.12.4	So Abram went, as the 
GEN.12.5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
GEN.12.6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. 
GEN.12.7	And the 
GEN.12.8	And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the 
GEN.12.9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
GEN.12.10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. 
GEN.12.11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 
GEN.12.12	and it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 
GEN.12.13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
GEN.12.14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 
GEN.12.15	And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
GEN.12.16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels. 
GEN.12.17	And the 
GEN.12.18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 
GEN.12.20	And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.
GEN.13.1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South. 
GEN.13.2	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 
GEN.13.3	And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai; 
GEN.13.4	unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
GEN.13.6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 
GEN.13.7	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. 
GEN.13.8	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren. 
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if 
GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the 
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose him all the Plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the 
GEN.13.14	And the 
GEN.13.15	for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. 
GEN.13.16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it. 
GEN.13.18	And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the 
GEN.14.1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea). 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. 
GEN.14.8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim; 
GEN.14.9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. 
GEN.14.11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 
GEN.14.12	And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
GEN.14.13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. 
GEN.14.14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. 
GEN.14.15	And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
GEN.14.17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King's Vale). 
GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High. 
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth: 
GEN.14.20	and blessed be God Most High, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
GEN.14.21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. 
GEN.14.22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not take a thread nor a shoelatchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 
GEN.14.24	save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me; Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	And Abram said, O Lord 
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 
GEN.15.4	And, behold, the word of the 
GEN.15.5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to tell them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 
GEN.15.6	And he believed in the 
GEN.15.7	And he said unto him, I am the 
GEN.15.8	And he said, O Lord 
GEN.15.9	And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
GEN.15.10	And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not. 
GEN.15.11	And the birds of prey came down upon the carcases, and Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 
GEN.15.13	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 
GEN.15.14	and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 
GEN.15.15	But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
GEN.15.17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. 
GEN.15.18	In that day the 
GEN.15.19	the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, 
GEN.15.20	and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the 
GEN.16.3	And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
GEN.16.4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 
GEN.16.5	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.
GEN.16.7	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.8	And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 
GEN.16.9	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.10	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.12	And he shall be 
GEN.16.13	And she called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
GEN.16.15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
GEN.17.1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the 
GEN.17.2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. 
GEN.17.3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
GEN.17.4	As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee. 
GEN.17.6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
GEN.17.7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. 
GEN.17.8	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. 
GEN.17.9	And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations. 
GEN.17.10	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every male among you shall be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you. 
GEN.17.12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. 
GEN.17.13	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
GEN.17.15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. 
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee! 
GEN.17.19	And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 
GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 
GEN.17.22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
GEN.17.23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
GEN.17.24	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	And the 
GEN.18.2	and he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, 
GEN.18.3	and said, My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
GEN.18.4	let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
GEN.18.5	and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
GEN.18.6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes. 
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it. 
GEN.18.8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
GEN.18.9	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
GEN.18.10	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. 
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, 
GEN.18.12	And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
GEN.18.13	And the 
GEN.18.14	Is any thing too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
GEN.18.16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
GEN.18.19	For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	And the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. 
GEN.18.22	And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
GEN.18.25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: 
GEN.18.28	peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five. 
GEN.18.29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake. 
GEN.18.30	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. 
GEN.18.31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake. 
GEN.18.32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake. 
GEN.18.33	And the 
GEN.19.1	And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth; 
GEN.19.2	and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 
GEN.19.3	And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, 
GEN.19.5	and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 
GEN.19.6	And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him. 
GEN.19.7	And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly. 
GEN.19.8	Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof. 
GEN.19.9	And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door. 
GEN.19.10	But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 
GEN.19.11	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
GEN.19.12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city; bring them out of the place: 
GEN.19.13	for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the 
GEN.19.14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the 
GEN.19.15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
GEN.19.16	But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the 
GEN.19.17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
GEN.19.18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord: 
GEN.19.19	behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die: 
GEN.19.20	behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
GEN.19.21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 
GEN.19.23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
GEN.19.26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
GEN.19.29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
GEN.19.30	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
GEN.19.32	come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
GEN.19.33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
GEN.19.34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
GEN.19.35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
GEN.19.36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
GEN.19.37	And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
GEN.20.1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. 
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation? 
GEN.20.5	Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this. 
GEN.20.6	And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
GEN.20.8	And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 
GEN.20.12	And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife: 
GEN.20.13	and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
GEN.20.14	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and menservants and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. 
GEN.20.16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and in respect of all thou art righted. 
GEN.20.17	And Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	And the 
GEN.21.2	And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me. 
GEN.21.7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age. 
GEN.21.8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 
GEN.21.10	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 
GEN.21.11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 
GEN.21.12	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
GEN.21.13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
GEN.21.14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 
GEN.21.15	And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
GEN.21.16	And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 
GEN.21.17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.21.19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
GEN.21.20	And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: 
GEN.21.23	now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, I will swear. 
GEN.21.25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
GEN.21.26	And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today. 
GEN.21.27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. 
GEN.21.28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
GEN.21.30	And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 
GEN.21.31	Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. 
GEN.21.32	So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
GEN.21.33	And 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
GEN.22.1	And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I. 
GEN.22.2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
GEN.22.3	And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 
GEN.22.5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you. 
GEN.22.6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. 
GEN.22.7	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 
GEN.22.8	And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son: so they went both of them together. 
GEN.22.9	And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 
GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
GEN.22.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.12	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. 
GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind 
GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the 
GEN.22.15	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the 
GEN.22.17	that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 
GEN.22.18	and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
GEN.22.20	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor; 
GEN.22.21	Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; 
GEN.22.22	and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
GEN.22.23	And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
GEN.22.24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	And the life of Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years: these were the years of the life of Sarah. 
GEN.23.2	And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
GEN.23.3	And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying, 
GEN.23.4	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 
GEN.23.5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
GEN.23.6	Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 
GEN.23.7	And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. 
GEN.23.8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a buryingplace. 
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
GEN.23.11	Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 
GEN.23.12	And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 
GEN.23.14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
GEN.23.15	My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
GEN.23.16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current 
GEN.23.17	So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure 
GEN.23.18	unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the children of Heth.
GEN.24.1	And Abraham was old, 
GEN.24.2	And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 
GEN.24.3	and I will make thee swear by the 
GEN.24.4	but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac. 
GEN.24.5	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
GEN.24.6	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again. 
GEN.24.9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; having all goodly things of his master's in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 
GEN.24.11	And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	And he said, O 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 
GEN.24.14	and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. 
GEN.24.15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up. 
GEN.24.17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher. 
GEN.24.18	And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
GEN.24.19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 
GEN.24.20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	And the man looked stedfastly on her; holding his peace, to know whether the 
GEN.24.22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 
GEN.24.23	and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in? 
GEN.24.24	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 
GEN.24.25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 
GEN.24.26	And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.27	And he said, Blessed be the 
GEN.24.28	And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.
GEN.24.29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain. 
GEN.24.30	And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain. 
GEN.24.31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the 
GEN.24.32	And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him. 
GEN.24.33	And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 
GEN.24.34	And he said, I am Abraham's servant. 
GEN.24.35	And the 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 
GEN.24.38	but thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son. 
GEN.24.39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 
GEN.24.40	And he said unto me, The 
GEN.24.41	then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 
GEN.24.42	And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O 
GEN.24.43	behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden which cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 
GEN.24.44	and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the 
GEN.24.45	And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 
GEN.24.46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 
GEN.24.47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands. 
GEN.24.48	And I bowed my head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.49	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the 
GEN.24.51	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the 
GEN.24.52	And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto the 
GEN.24.53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
GEN.24.54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 
GEN.24.55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us 
GEN.24.56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the 
GEN.24.57	And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. 
GEN.24.58	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 
GEN.24.59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou 
GEN.24.61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
GEN.24.62	And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South. 
GEN.24.63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming. 
GEN.24.64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 
GEN.24.65	And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
GEN.25.1	And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
GEN.25.7	And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 
GEN.25.8	And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full 
GEN.25.9	And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 
GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
GEN.25.11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. 
GEN.25.12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
GEN.25.13	and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 
GEN.25.16	these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. 
GEN.25.17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 
GEN.25.18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he abode in the presence of all his brethren.
GEN.25.19	And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 
GEN.25.20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. 
GEN.25.21	And Isaac entreated the 
GEN.25.22	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of the 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	And the first came forth red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 
GEN.25.26	And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. 
GEN.25.27	And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 
GEN.25.28	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint: 
GEN.25.30	and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red 
GEN.25.31	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
GEN.25.32	And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me? 
GEN.25.33	And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	And the 
GEN.26.3	sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
GEN.26.4	and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 
GEN.26.5	because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
GEN.26.6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 
GEN.26.7	and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My wife; lest, 
GEN.26.8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
GEN.26.9	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 
GEN.26.10	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 
GEN.26.11	And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
GEN.26.12	And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year an hundredfold: and the 
GEN.26.13	And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great: 
GEN.26.14	and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 
GEN.26.17	And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
GEN.26.18	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
GEN.26.19	And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
GEN.26.20	And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they contended with him. 
GEN.26.21	And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 
GEN.26.22	And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the 
GEN.26.23	And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. 
GEN.26.27	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
GEN.26.28	And they said, We saw plainly that the 
GEN.26.29	that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the 
GEN.26.30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
GEN.26.31	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
GEN.26.32	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 
GEN.26.33	And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
GEN.26.34	And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
GEN.26.35	and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Here am I. 
GEN.27.2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison; 
GEN.27.4	and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 
GEN.27.5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
GEN.27.6	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
GEN.27.7	Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
GEN.27.10	and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death. 
GEN.27.11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 
GEN.27.12	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 
GEN.27.13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
GEN.27.14	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 
GEN.27.15	And Rebekah took the goodly raiment of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 
GEN.27.16	and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 
GEN.27.17	and she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
GEN.27.19	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
GEN.27.20	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the 
GEN.27.21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 
GEN.27.22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
GEN.27.23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 
GEN.27.25	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 
GEN.27.27	And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which the 
GEN.27.28	And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of corn and wine: 
GEN.27.29	Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee: Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.
GEN.27.30	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	And he also made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father; and he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
GEN.27.32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau. 
GEN.27.33	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, 
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. 
GEN.27.35	And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing. 
GEN.27.36	And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 
GEN.27.37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son? 
GEN.27.38	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
GEN.27.39	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above; 
GEN.27.40	And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; And it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.
GEN.27.41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
GEN.27.42	And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, 
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 
GEN.27.44	and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
GEN.27.45	until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be bereaved of you both in one day? 
GEN.27.46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
GEN.28.1	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. 
GEN.28.3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples; 
GEN.28.4	and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham. 
GEN.28.5	And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
GEN.28.6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram: 
GEN.28.8	and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 
GEN.28.9	and Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
GEN.28.10	And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
GEN.28.13	And, behold, the 
GEN.28.14	and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 
GEN.28.15	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
GEN.28.16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
GEN.28.18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of the city was Luz at the first. 
GEN.28.20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
GEN.28.21	so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the 
GEN.28.22	and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. 
GEN.29.2	And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the stone upon the well's mouth was great. 
GEN.29.3	And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place. 
GEN.29.4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. 
GEN.29.5	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 
GEN.29.6	And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. 
GEN.29.7	And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. 
GEN.29.8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
GEN.29.9	While he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them. 
GEN.29.10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
GEN.29.11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 
GEN.29.13	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
GEN.29.15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? 
GEN.29.16	And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	And Leah's eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 
GEN.29.18	And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
GEN.29.19	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 
GEN.29.20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 
GEN.29.21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 
GEN.29.22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
GEN.29.23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for an handmaid. 
GEN.29.25	And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 
GEN.29.26	And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
GEN.29.27	Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife. 
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. 
GEN.29.30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
GEN.29.31	And the 
GEN.29.32	And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Because the 
GEN.29.33	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the 
GEN.29.34	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I praise the 
GEN.30.1	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 
GEN.30.2	And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 
GEN.30.3	And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her. 
GEN.30.4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. 
GEN.30.7	And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. 
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife. 
GEN.30.10	And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad. 
GEN.30.12	And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher.
GEN.30.14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 
GEN.30.15	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes. 
GEN.30.16	And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
GEN.30.22	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
GEN.30.24	and she called his name Joseph, saying, The 
GEN.30.25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee. 
GEN.30.27	And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, 
GEN.30.28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. 
GEN.30.29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle hath fared with me. 
GEN.30.30	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and the 
GEN.30.31	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it. 
GEN.30.32	I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and 
GEN.30.33	So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that 
GEN.30.34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 
GEN.30.35	And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons; 
GEN.30.36	and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
GEN.30.37	And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree; and peeled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
GEN.30.38	And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock. 
GEN.30.41	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; 
GEN.30.42	but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
GEN.30.43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.
GEN.31.1	And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime. 
GEN.31.3	And the 
GEN.31.4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 
GEN.31.5	and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me. 
GEN.31.6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
GEN.31.7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstraked. 
GEN.31.9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. 
GEN.31.10	And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. 
GEN.31.11	And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I. 
GEN.31.12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity. 
GEN.31.14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
GEN.31.15	Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money. 
GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels; 
GEN.31.18	and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's. 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead. 
GEN.31.22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
GEN.31.23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
GEN.31.25	And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword? 
GEN.31.27	Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; 
GEN.31.28	and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly. 
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
GEN.31.30	And now, 
GEN.31.31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 
GEN.31.33	And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not. 
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
GEN.31.36	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me? 
GEN.31.37	Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two. 
GEN.31.38	This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten. 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
GEN.31.40	Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes. 
GEN.31.41	These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
GEN.31.43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have borne? 
GEN.31.44	And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. 
GEN.31.45	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
GEN.31.46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there by the heap. 
GEN.31.47	And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 
GEN.31.48	And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed: 
GEN.31.49	and Mizpah, for he said, The 
GEN.31.50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. 
GEN.31.51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee. 
GEN.31.52	This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.54	And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
GEN.32.1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau; Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now: 
GEN.32.5	and I have oxen, and asses 
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; 
GEN.32.8	and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
GEN.32.9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies. 
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. 
GEN.32.12	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother; 
GEN.32.14	two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. 
GEN.32.16	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
GEN.32.17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 
GEN.32.18	then thou shalt say, 
GEN.32.19	And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; 
GEN.32.20	and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me. 
GEN.32.21	So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company. 
GEN.32.22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that he had.
GEN.32.24	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
GEN.32.25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. 
GEN.32.26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 
GEN.32.27	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
GEN.32.28	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
GEN.32.29	And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 
GEN.32.30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, 
GEN.32.31	And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
GEN.33.1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
GEN.33.2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
GEN.33.3	And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
GEN.33.4	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
GEN.33.5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
GEN.33.6	Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
GEN.33.7	And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 
GEN.33.8	And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find grace in the sight of my lord. 
GEN.33.9	And Esau said, I have enough; my brother, let that thou hast be thine. 
GEN.33.10	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 
GEN.33.11	Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it. 
GEN.33.12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 
GEN.33.13	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me give suck: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. 
GEN.33.14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according to the pace of the cattle that is before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 
GEN.33.15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
GEN.33.17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. 
GEN.33.18	And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city. 
GEN.33.19	And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 
GEN.33.20	And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
GEN.34.1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
GEN.34.2	And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her. 
GEN.34.3	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
GEN.34.4	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 
GEN.34.5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
GEN.34.6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. 
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done. 
GEN.34.8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her unto him to wife. 
GEN.34.9	And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 
GEN.34.10	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 
GEN.34.11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 
GEN.34.12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 
GEN.34.13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 
GEN.34.14	and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 
GEN.34.15	Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 
GEN.34.16	then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
GEN.34.18	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 
GEN.34.19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was honoured above all the house of his father. 
GEN.34.20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
GEN.34.22	Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
GEN.34.23	Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 
GEN.34.24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
GEN.34.25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males. 
GEN.34.26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth. 
GEN.34.27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field; 
GEN.34.29	and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and spoiled, even all that was in the house. 
GEN.34.30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 
GEN.34.31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
GEN.35.1	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments: 
GEN.35.3	and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 
GEN.35.4	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	And they journeyed: and a great terror was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him. 
GEN.35.7	And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
GEN.35.8	And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. 
GEN.35.9	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 
GEN.35.11	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 
GEN.35.12	and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 
GEN.35.13	And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him. 
GEN.35.14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. 
GEN.35.15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.
GEN.35.16	And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 
GEN.35.17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son. 
GEN.35.18	And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin. 
GEN.35.19	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem). 
GEN.35.20	And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
GEN.35.21	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
GEN.35.22	And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
GEN.35.23	the sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 
GEN.35.24	the sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin: 
GEN.35.25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan and Naphtali: 
GEN.35.26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Paddan-aram. 
GEN.35.27	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 
GEN.35.28	And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. 
GEN.35.29	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
GEN.36.1	Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom). 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
GEN.36.3	and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel; 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.36.6	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle. 
GEN.36.8	And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 
GEN.36.10	these are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.13	And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.14	And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. 
GEN.36.15	These are the dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	duke Korah, duke Gatam, duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.18	And these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jalam, duke Korah: these are the dukes that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau, and these are their dukes: the same is Edom.
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land; Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah, 
GEN.36.21	and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the dukes that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
GEN.36.23	And these are the children of Shobal; Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	And these are the children of Zibeon; Aiah and Anah: this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father. 
GEN.36.25	And these are the children of Anah; Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.26	And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran. 
GEN.36.27	These are the children of Ezer; Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	These are the children of Dishan; Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 
GEN.36.30	duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of the Horites, according to their dukes in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 
GEN.36.32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.34	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.35	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 
GEN.36.36	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.37	And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.38	And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.39	And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. 
GEN.36.40	And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timna, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth; 
GEN.36.41	duke Oholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon; 
GEN.36.42	duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar; 
GEN.36.43	duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau the father of the Edomites.
GEN.37.1	And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father. 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. 
GEN.37.4	And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
GEN.37.5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 
GEN.37.6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 
GEN.37.7	for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
GEN.37.8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
GEN.37.9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me. 
GEN.37.10	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 
GEN.37.11	And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
GEN.37.12	And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 
GEN.37.14	And he said to him, Go now, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
GEN.37.15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 
GEN.37.16	And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding 
GEN.37.17	And the man said, They are departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 
GEN.37.19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 
GEN.37.20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 
GEN.37.21	And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said, Let us not take his life. 
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
GEN.37.23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was on him; 
GEN.37.24	and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 
GEN.37.25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a travelling company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 
GEN.37.26	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him. 
GEN.37.28	And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt. 
GEN.37.29	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
GEN.37.30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
GEN.37.31	And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood; 
GEN.37.32	and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or not. 
GEN.37.33	And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces. 
GEN.37.34	And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to the grave to my son mourning. And his father wept for him. 
GEN.37.36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.
GEN.38.1	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her. 
GEN.38.3	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 
GEN.38.4	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 
GEN.38.5	And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
GEN.38.6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the 
GEN.38.8	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
GEN.38.9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. 
GEN.38.10	And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the 
GEN.38.11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up: for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
GEN.38.12	And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
GEN.38.13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father in law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep. 
GEN.38.14	And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; for she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter in law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
GEN.38.17	And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 
GEN.38.18	And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 
GEN.38.19	And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
GEN.38.20	And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was at Enaim by the way side? And they said, There hath been no harlot here. 
GEN.38.22	And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no harlot here. 
GEN.38.23	And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
GEN.38.24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 
GEN.38.25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff. 
GEN.38.26	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 
GEN.38.27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
GEN.38.29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore his name was called Perez. 
GEN.38.30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.
GEN.39.1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither. 
GEN.39.2	And the 
GEN.39.3	And his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 
GEN.39.5	And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the 
GEN.39.6	And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught 
GEN.39.7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
GEN.39.8	But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand; 
GEN.39.9	there is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 
GEN.39.10	And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, 
GEN.39.11	And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within. 
GEN.39.12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
GEN.39.13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
GEN.39.14	that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
GEN.39.15	and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out. 
GEN.39.16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 
GEN.39.18	and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.
GEN.39.19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
GEN.39.20	And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. 
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 
GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand, because the 
GEN.40.1	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 
GEN.40.3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
GEN.40.4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.
GEN.40.5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. 
GEN.40.6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad. 
GEN.40.7	And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 
GEN.40.8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you. 
GEN.40.9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 
GEN.40.10	and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, 
GEN.40.11	and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 
GEN.40.12	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; 
GEN.40.13	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 
GEN.40.14	But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
GEN.40.15	for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head: 
GEN.40.17	and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 
GEN.40.18	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days; 
GEN.40.19	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
GEN.40.20	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 
GEN.40.21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 
GEN.40.22	but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
GEN.41.1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
GEN.41.2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well favoured and fatfleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass. 
GEN.41.3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 
GEN.41.4	And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
GEN.41.5	And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
GEN.41.6	And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
GEN.41.7	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.9	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker: 
GEN.41.11	and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
GEN.41.12	And there was with us there a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 
GEN.41.13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it. 
GEN.41.16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river: 
GEN.41.18	and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in the reed-grass: 
GEN.41.19	and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
GEN.41.20	and the lean and ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
GEN.41.21	and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
GEN.41.22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good: 
GEN.41.23	and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, 
GEN.41.24	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. 
GEN.41.25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
GEN.41.27	And the seven lean and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath shewed unto Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 
GEN.41.30	and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
GEN.41.31	and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous. 
GEN.41.32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
GEN.41.33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do 
GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 
GEN.41.36	And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. 
GEN.41.37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is? 
GEN.41.39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou: 
GEN.41.40	thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.42	And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
GEN.41.43	and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
GEN.41.48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
GEN.41.49	And Joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. 
GEN.41.50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bare unto him. 
GEN.41.51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For, 
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. 
GEN.41.53	And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end. 
GEN.41.54	And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
GEN.41.55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
GEN.41.56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth.
GEN.42.1	Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 
GEN.42.2	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 
GEN.42.3	And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
GEN.42.5	And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.6	And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
GEN.42.7	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 
GEN.42.8	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
GEN.42.9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
GEN.42.10	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 
GEN.42.11	We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 
GEN.42.12	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
GEN.42.13	And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 
GEN.42.14	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 
GEN.42.15	hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 
GEN.42.17	And he put them all together into ward three days. 
GEN.42.18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 
GEN.42.19	if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 
GEN.42.20	and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
GEN.42.21	And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 
GEN.42.22	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required. 
GEN.42.23	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. 
GEN.42.24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done unto them. 
GEN.42.26	And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence. 
GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.42.28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?
GEN.42.29	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them; saying, 
GEN.42.30	The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. 
GEN.42.31	And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 
GEN.42.32	we be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.33	And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren with me, and take 
GEN.42.34	and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 
GEN.42.35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. 
GEN.42.36	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. 
GEN.42.37	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 
GEN.42.38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
GEN.43.1	And the famine was sore in the land. 
GEN.43.2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 
GEN.43.3	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
GEN.43.4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 
GEN.43.5	but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
GEN.43.6	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
GEN.43.7	And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye 
GEN.43.8	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. 
GEN.43.9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
GEN.43.10	for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.
GEN.43.11	And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this; take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 
GEN.43.12	and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 
GEN.43.13	take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
GEN.43.14	and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
GEN.43.15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon. 
GEN.43.17	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
GEN.43.19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 
GEN.43.21	and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 
GEN.43.22	And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks. 
GEN.43.23	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
GEN.43.24	And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 
GEN.43.25	And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth. 
GEN.43.27	And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 
GEN.43.28	And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance. 
GEN.43.29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
GEN.43.30	And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. 
GEN.43.31	And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
GEN.43.32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one with another. 
GEN.43.34	And he took 
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 
GEN.44.2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 
GEN.44.4	 when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 
GEN.44.6	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words. 
GEN.44.7	And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do such a thing. 
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 
GEN.44.9	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 
GEN.44.10	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless. 
GEN.44.11	Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 
GEN.44.12	And he searched, 
GEN.44.13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. 
GEN.44.14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 
GEN.44.15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine? 
GEN.44.16	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found. 
GEN.44.17	And he said, God forbid that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
GEN.44.18	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 
GEN.44.20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 
GEN.44.21	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
GEN.44.22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. 
GEN.44.23	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 
GEN.44.24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food. 
GEN.44.26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. 
GEN.44.27	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: 
GEN.44.28	and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since: 
GEN.44.29	and if ye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 
GEN.44.30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; 
GEN.44.31	it shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not 
GEN.44.32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. 
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 
GEN.45.2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
GEN.45.3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. 
GEN.45.4	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 
GEN.45.6	For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in the which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest. 
GEN.45.7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. 
GEN.45.8	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 
GEN.45.10	and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 
GEN.45.11	and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast. 
GEN.45.12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
GEN.45.13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 
GEN.45.14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
GEN.45.15	And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
GEN.45.16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 
GEN.45.18	and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 
GEN.45.19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
GEN.45.20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. 
GEN.45.21	And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
GEN.45.22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. 
GEN.45.23	And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and victual for his father by the way. 
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
GEN.45.25	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father. 
GEN.45.26	And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not. 
GEN.45.27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 
GEN.45.28	and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
GEN.46.1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 
GEN.46.3	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
GEN.46.5	And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 
GEN.46.7	his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. 
GEN.46.8	And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 
GEN.46.9	And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 
GEN.46.11	And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. 
GEN.46.16	And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	And the sons of Asher; Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, which Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bare unto him. 
GEN.46.21	And the sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 
GEN.46.23	And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. 
GEN.46.26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; 
GEN.46.27	and the sons of Joseph, which were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
GEN.46.28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to shew the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 
GEN.46.29	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
GEN.46.30	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive. 
GEN.46.31	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 
GEN.46.32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 
GEN.46.33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? 
GEN.46.34	that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.47.2	And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers. 
GEN.47.4	And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.47.5	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 
GEN.47.6	the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. 
GEN.47.7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life? 
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
GEN.47.13	And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
GEN.47.15	And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for 
GEN.47.16	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. 
GEN.47.17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. 
GEN.47.18	And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 
GEN.47.19	wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate. 
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh's. 
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 
GEN.47.24	And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. 
GEN.47.25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 
GEN.47.26	And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.
GEN.47.27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. 
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were an hundred forty and seven years. 
GEN.47.29	And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 
GEN.47.30	but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 
GEN.47.31	And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
GEN.48.1	And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
GEN.48.2	And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 
GEN.48.3	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
GEN.48.4	and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 
GEN.48.5	And now thy two sons, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine. 
GEN.48.6	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
GEN.48.8	And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? 
GEN.48.9	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 
GEN.48.11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also. 
GEN.48.12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. 
GEN.48.14	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 
GEN.48.15	And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which hath fed me all my life long unto this day, 
GEN.48.16	the angel which hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. 
GEN.48.17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 
GEN.48.19	And his father refused, and said, I know 
GEN.48.20	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
GEN.49.1	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days. 
GEN.49.2	Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father. 
GEN.49.3	Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power. 
GEN.49.4	Unstable as water, thou shalt not have the excellency; Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed: Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords. 
GEN.49.6	O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their selfwill they houghed an ox. 
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee. 
GEN.49.9	Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? 
GEN.49.10	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come; And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be. 
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes: 
GEN.49.12	His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.
GEN.49.13	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea: And he shall be for an haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Zidon. 
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds: 
GEN.49.15	And he saw a resting place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork. 
GEN.49.16	Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel. 
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward. 
GEN.49.18	I have waited for thy salvation, O 
GEN.49.19	Gad, a troop shall press upon him: But he shall press upon their heel. 
GEN.49.20	Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties. 
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.
GEN.49.22	Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall. 
GEN.49.23	The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecuted him: 
GEN.49.24	But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel,) 
GEN.49.25	Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb. 
GEN.49.26	The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 
GEN.49.27	Benjamin is a wolf that ravineth: In the morning he shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil.
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. 
GEN.49.29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace: 
GEN.49.31	there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah: 
GEN.49.32	the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth. 
GEN.49.33	And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
GEN.50.1	And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days. 
GEN.50.4	And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.50.5	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
GEN.50.7	And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
GEN.50.8	and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 
GEN.50.10	And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
GEN.50.11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 
GEN.50.12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 
GEN.50.13	for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a buryingplace, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
GEN.50.14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
GEN.50.15	And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 
GEN.50.16	And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 
GEN.50.17	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
GEN.50.18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 
GEN.50.19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 
GEN.50.20	And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 
GEN.50.21	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
GEN.50.22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees. 
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
GEN.50.25	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already. 
EXO.1.6	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 
EXO.1.7	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 
EXO.1.8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: 
EXO.1.10	come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land. 
EXO.1.11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
EXO.1.13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 
EXO.1.14	and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigour. 
EXO.1.15	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 
EXO.1.16	and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birthstool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 
EXO.1.18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 
EXO.1.19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them. 
EXO.1.20	And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
EXO.1.21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 
EXO.1.22	And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
EXO.2.1	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 
EXO.2.2	And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 
EXO.2.3	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
EXO.2.5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. 
EXO.2.6	And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 
EXO.2.7	Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
EXO.2.9	And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 
EXO.2.10	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
EXO.2.11	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
EXO.2.12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
EXO.2.14	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. 
EXO.2.15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
EXO.2.17	And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon today? 
EXO.2.19	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock. 
EXO.2.20	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
EXO.2.21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
EXO.2.22	And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land.
EXO.2.23	And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
EXO.2.24	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge 
EXO.3.1	Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb. 
EXO.3.2	And the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
EXO.3.4	And when the 
EXO.3.5	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
EXO.3.6	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
EXO.3.7	And the 
EXO.3.8	and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.3.9	And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 
EXO.3.10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
EXO.3.11	And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
EXO.3.12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 
EXO.3.13	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 
EXO.3.14	And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 
EXO.3.15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The 
EXO.3.16	Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The 
EXO.3.17	and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
EXO.3.18	And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The 
EXO.3.19	And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
EXO.3.20	And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
EXO.3.22	but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
EXO.4.1	And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The 
EXO.4.2	And the 
EXO.4.3	And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
EXO.4.4	And the 
EXO.4.5	that they may believe that the 
EXO.4.6	And the 
EXO.4.7	And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his 
EXO.4.8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
EXO.4.9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
EXO.4.10	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.4.11	And the 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak. 
EXO.4.13	And he said, Oh Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. 
EXO.4.14	And the anger of the 
EXO.4.15	And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 
EXO.4.16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God. 
EXO.4.17	And thou shalt take in thine hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
EXO.4.18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. 
EXO.4.19	And the 
EXO.4.20	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.4.23	and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy firstborn.
EXO.4.24	And it came to pass on the way at the lodging place, that the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me. 
EXO.4.26	So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood 
EXO.4.27	And the 
EXO.4.28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the 
EXO.4.29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron spake all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed: and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.5.2	And Pharaoh said, Who is the 
EXO.5.3	And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the 
EXO.5.4	And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 
EXO.5.6	And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
EXO.5.7	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 
EXO.5.9	Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying words.
EXO.5.10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished. 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Fulfill your works, 
EXO.5.14	And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and today, in making brick as heretofore?
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
EXO.5.16	There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. 
EXO.5.17	But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.18	Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
EXO.5.19	And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not minish aught from your bricks, 
EXO.5.20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
EXO.5.21	and they said unto them, The 
EXO.5.22	And Moses returned unto the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath evil entreated this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
EXO.6.1	And the 
EXO.6.2	And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am JEHOVAH: 
EXO.6.3	and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH I was not known to them. 
EXO.6.4	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. 
EXO.6.5	And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 
EXO.6.6	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgements: 
EXO.6.7	and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you in unto the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am Jehovah. 
EXO.6.9	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.6.12	And Moses spake before the 
EXO.6.13	And the 
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben. 
EXO.6.15	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon. 
EXO.6.16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon; Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
EXO.6.18	And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. 
EXO.6.19	And the sons of Merari; Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
EXO.6.20	And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years. 
EXO.6.21	And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
EXO.6.23	And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 
EXO.6.25	And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' 
EXO.6.26	These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the 
EXO.6.27	These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 
EXO.6.28	And it came to pass on the day when the 
EXO.6.29	that the 
EXO.6.30	And Moses said before the 
EXO.7.1	And the 
EXO.7.2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.7.3	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgements. 
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did so; as the 
EXO.7.7	And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	And the 
EXO.7.9	When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a wonder for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent. 
EXO.7.10	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments. 
EXO.7.12	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
EXO.7.13	And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.7.14	And the 
EXO.7.15	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
EXO.7.16	And thou shalt say unto him, The 
EXO.7.17	Thus saith the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river. 
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as the 
EXO.7.21	And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.7.23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart. 
EXO.7.24	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
EXO.7.25	And seven days were fulfilled, after that the 
EXO.8.1	And the 
EXO.8.2	And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 
EXO.8.3	and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 
EXO.8.4	and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 
EXO.8.5	And the 
EXO.8.6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the 
EXO.8.9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only? 
EXO.8.10	And he said, Against tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the 
EXO.8.11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 
EXO.8.12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together in heaps: and the land stank. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.8.16	And the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.8.20	And the 
EXO.8.21	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 
EXO.8.22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the 
EXO.8.23	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by tomorrow shall this sign be. 
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
EXO.8.26	And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the 
EXO.8.27	We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the 
EXO.8.30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 
EXO.9.3	behold, the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	And the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	And the 
EXO.9.7	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	And the 
EXO.9.9	And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.9.10	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. 
EXO.9.11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	And the 
EXO.9.13	And the 
EXO.9.14	For I will this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
EXO.9.15	For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth: 
EXO.9.16	but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, for to shew thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
EXO.9.17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 
EXO.9.19	Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; 
EXO.9.20	He that feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	and he that regarded not the word of the 
EXO.9.22	And the 
EXO.9.23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the 
EXO.9.24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. 
EXO.9.27	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the 
EXO.9.28	Entreat the 
EXO.9.29	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the 
EXO.9.30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the 
EXO.9.31	And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up. 
EXO.9.33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the 
EXO.9.34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go; as the 
EXO.10.1	And the 
EXO.10.2	and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
EXO.10.4	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring locusts into thy border: 
EXO.10.5	and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
EXO.10.6	and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh. 
EXO.10.7	And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the 
EXO.10.8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the 
EXO.10.10	And he said unto them, So be the 
EXO.10.11	Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the 
EXO.10.12	And the 
EXO.10.13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the 
EXO.10.18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	And the 
EXO.10.22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 
EXO.10.23	they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
EXO.10.24	And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the 
EXO.10.25	And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die. 
EXO.10.29	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.
EXO.11.1	And the 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	And Moses said, Thus saith the 
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
EXO.11.6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 
EXO.11.7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the 
EXO.11.8	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. 
EXO.11.9	And the 
EXO.11.10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the 
EXO.12.1	And the 
EXO.12.2	This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. 
EXO.12.3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth 
EXO.12.4	and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats: 
EXO.12.6	and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even. 
EXO.12.7	And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it. 
EXO.12.8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. 
EXO.12.9	Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof. 
EXO.12.10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
EXO.12.11	And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the 
EXO.12.12	For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgements: I am the 
EXO.12.13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 
EXO.12.14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the 
EXO.12.15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	And in the first day there shall be to you an holy convocation, and in the seventh day an holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. 
EXO.12.17	And ye shall observe the 
EXO.12.18	In the first 
EXO.12.19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land. 
EXO.12.20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover. 
EXO.12.22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
EXO.12.25	And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the 
EXO.12.26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 
EXO.12.27	that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the 
EXO.12.28	And the children of Israel went and did so; as the 
EXO.12.29	And it came to pass at midnight, that the 
EXO.12.30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
EXO.12.31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the 
EXO.12.32	Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. 
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. 
EXO.12.34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 
EXO.12.36	and the 
EXO.12.37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. 
EXO.12.38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. 
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 
EXO.12.40	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, which they sojourned in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. 
EXO.12.41	And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the 
EXO.12.42	It is a night to be much observed unto the 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 
EXO.12.45	A sojourner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
EXO.12.46	In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
EXO.12.48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the 
EXO.12.49	One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. 
EXO.12.50	Thus did all the children of Israel; as the 
EXO.12.51	And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the 
EXO.13.1	And the 
EXO.13.2	Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. 
EXO.13.3	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.4	This day ye go forth in the month Abib. 
EXO.13.5	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders. 
EXO.13.8	And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which the 
EXO.13.9	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the 
EXO.13.10	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
EXO.13.11	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.12	that thou shalt set apart unto the 
EXO.13.13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem. 
EXO.13.14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the 
EXO.13.15	and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the 
EXO.13.16	And it shall be for a sign upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.17	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 
EXO.13.18	but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 
EXO.13.19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 
EXO.13.20	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	And the 
EXO.13.22	the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.
EXO.14.1	And the 
EXO.14.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
EXO.14.3	And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
EXO.14.6	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 
EXO.14.7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. 
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses 
EXO.14.10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the 
EXO.14.11	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 
EXO.14.13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	And the 
EXO.14.16	And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
EXO.14.17	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them: 
EXO.14.20	and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night.
EXO.14.21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the 
EXO.14.22	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.24	And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the 
EXO.14.25	And he took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the 
EXO.14.26	And the 
EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the 
EXO.14.28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them. 
EXO.14.29	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	And Israel saw the great work which the 
EXO.15.1	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the 
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. 
EXO.15.5	The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone. 
EXO.15.6	Thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble. 
EXO.15.8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood upright as an heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil: My lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 
EXO.15.10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters. 
EXO.15.11	Who is like unto thee, O 
EXO.15.12	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, The earth swallowed them. 
EXO.15.13	Thou in thy mercy hast led the people which thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. 
EXO.15.14	The peoples have heard, they tremble: Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 
EXO.15.15	Then were the dukes of Edom amazed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. 
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread falleth upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O 
EXO.15.17	Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place, O 
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the 
EXO.15.20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
EXO.15.21	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the 
EXO.15.22	And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. 
EXO.15.24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
EXO.15.25	And he cried unto the 
EXO.15.26	and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
EXO.16.1	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness: 
EXO.16.3	and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of the 
EXO.16.4	Then said the 
EXO.16.5	And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 
EXO.16.6	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the 
EXO.16.7	and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, 
EXO.16.9	And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the 
EXO.16.10	And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp. 
EXO.16.14	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which the 
EXO.16.16	This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 
EXO.16.19	And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. 
EXO.16.21	And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
EXO.16.23	And he said unto them, This is that which the 
EXO.16.24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
EXO.16.25	And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the 
EXO.16.26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. 
EXO.16.27	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none. 
EXO.16.28	And the 
EXO.16.29	See, for that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day. 
EXO.16.31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers 
EXO.16.32	And Moses said, This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.33	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
EXO.17.1	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of the 
EXO.17.2	Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the 
EXO.17.3	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 
EXO.17.4	And Moses cried unto the 
EXO.17.5	And the 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the 
EXO.17.8	Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
EXO.17.13	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
EXO.17.14	And the 
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi: 
EXO.17.16	and he said, The 
EXO.18.1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that the 
EXO.18.2	And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away, 
EXO.18.3	and her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land: 
EXO.18.4	and the name of the other was Eliezer; for 
EXO.18.5	and Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God: 
EXO.18.6	and he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
EXO.18.7	And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	And Moses told his father in law all that the 
EXO.18.9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the 
EXO.18.10	And Jethro said, Blessed be the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
EXO.18.13	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
EXO.18.14	And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even? 
EXO.18.15	And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God: 
EXO.18.16	when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
EXO.18.17	And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. 
EXO.18.18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 
EXO.18.19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God: 
EXO.18.20	and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
EXO.18.21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
EXO.18.22	and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear 
EXO.18.23	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace. 
EXO.18.24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
EXO.18.27	And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 
EXO.19.3	And Moses went up unto God, and the 
EXO.19.4	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 
EXO.19.5	Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: 
EXO.19.6	and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 
EXO.19.7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the 
EXO.19.8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that the 
EXO.19.9	And the 
EXO.19.10	And the 
EXO.19.11	and be ready against the third day: for the third day the 
EXO.19.12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 
EXO.19.13	no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 
EXO.19.14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments. 
EXO.19.15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.
EXO.19.16	And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. 
EXO.19.17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
EXO.19.18	And mount Sinai was altogether on smoke, because the 
EXO.19.19	And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
EXO.19.20	And the 
EXO.19.21	And the 
EXO.19.22	And let the priests also, which come near to the 
EXO.19.23	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.19.24	And the 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.
EXO.20.1	And God spake all these words, saying, 
EXO.20.2	I am the 
EXO.20.3	Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 
EXO.20.4	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor 
EXO.20.5	thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the 
EXO.20.6	and shewing mercy unto thousands, of them that love me and keep my commandments. 
EXO.20.7	Thou shalt not take the name of the 
EXO.20.8	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
EXO.20.9	Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the 
EXO.20.11	for in six days the 
EXO.20.12	Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the 
EXO.20.13	Thou shalt do no murder. 
EXO.20.14	Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
EXO.20.15	Thou shalt not steal. 
EXO.20.16	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
EXO.20.17	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.
EXO.20.18	And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off. 
EXO.20.19	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 
EXO.20.20	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not. 
EXO.20.21	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
EXO.20.22	And the 
EXO.20.23	Ye shall not make 
EXO.20.24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee. 
EXO.20.25	And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 
EXO.20.26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
EXO.21.1	Now these are the judgements which thou shalt set before them. 
EXO.21.2	If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 
EXO.21.3	If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 
EXO.21.5	But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. 
EXO.21.7	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. 
EXO.21.8	If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 
EXO.21.9	And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 
EXO.21.10	If he take him another 
EXO.21.11	And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
EXO.21.12	He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.13	And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver 
EXO.21.14	And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. 
EXO.21.15	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. 
EXO.21.16	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.17	And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.18	And if men contend, and one smiteth the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed: 
EXO.21.19	if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. 
EXO.21.20	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished. 
EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
EXO.21.22	And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 
EXO.21.23	But if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 
EXO.21.24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 
EXO.21.26	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. 
EXO.21.27	And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. 
EXO.21.28	And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. 
EXO.21.29	But if the ox were wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 
EXO.21.31	Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgement shall it be done unto him. 
EXO.21.32	If the ox gore a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. 
EXO.21.33	And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, 
EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner of them, and the dead 
EXO.21.35	And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide. 
EXO.21.36	Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead 
EXO.22.1	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. 
EXO.22.2	If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten that he die, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. 
EXO.22.3	If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him: he should make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 
EXO.22.4	If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall pay double. 
EXO.22.5	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. 
EXO.22.6	If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
EXO.22.7	If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double. 
EXO.22.8	If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, 
EXO.22.9	For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, 
EXO.22.10	If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: 
EXO.22.11	the oath of the 
EXO.22.12	But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. 
EXO.22.13	If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn. 
EXO.22.14	And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution. 
EXO.22.15	If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for its hire.
EXO.22.16	And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 
EXO.22.17	If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. 
EXO.22.18	Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live. 
EXO.22.19	Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. 
EXO.22.20	He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the 
EXO.22.21	And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.22.22	Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 
EXO.22.23	If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; 
EXO.22.24	and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.25	If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him usury. 
EXO.22.26	If thou at all take thy neighbour's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 
EXO.22.27	for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. 
EXO.22.28	Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people. 
EXO.22.29	Thou shalt not delay to offer of the abundance of thy fruits, and of thy liquors. The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. 
EXO.22.30	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, 
EXO.22.31	And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
EXO.23.1	Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
EXO.23.2	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest 
EXO.23.3	neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause. 
EXO.23.4	If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 
EXO.23.5	If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 
EXO.23.6	Thou shalt not wrest the judgement of thy poor in his cause. 
EXO.23.7	Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 
EXO.23.8	And thou shalt take no gift: for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 
EXO.23.9	And a stranger shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
EXO.23.10	And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: 
EXO.23.11	but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, 
EXO.23.12	Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 
EXO.23.13	And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. 
EXO.23.14	Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 
EXO.23.15	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty: 
EXO.23.16	and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field.

EXO.29.32	And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting. 
EXO.29.33	And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate 
EXO.29.34	And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 
EXO.29.35	And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 
EXO.29.36	And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
EXO.29.37	Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
EXO.29.38	Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 
EXO.29.39	The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 
EXO.29.40	and with the one lamb a tenth part 
EXO.29.41	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the 
EXO.29.42	It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before the 
EXO.29.43	And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and 
EXO.29.44	And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest's office. 
EXO.29.45	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 
EXO.29.46	And they shall know that I am the 
EXO.30.1	And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it. 
EXO.30.2	A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. 
EXO.30.3	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 
EXO.30.4	And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves to bear it withal. 
EXO.30.5	And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.30.6	And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 
EXO.30.7	And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. 
EXO.30.8	And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the 
EXO.30.9	Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering; and ye shall pour no drink offering thereon. 
EXO.30.10	And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year: with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the 
EXO.30.11	And the 
EXO.30.12	When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the 
EXO.30.13	This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) half a shekel for an offering to the 
EXO.30.14	Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of the 
EXO.30.15	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of the 
EXO.30.16	And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the 
EXO.30.17	And the 
EXO.30.18	Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 
EXO.30.19	And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 
EXO.30.20	when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto the 
EXO.30.21	so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
EXO.30.22	Moreover the 
EXO.30.23	Take thou also unto thee the chief spices, of flowing myrrh five hundred 
EXO.30.24	and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil an hin: 
EXO.30.25	and thou shalt make it an holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 
EXO.30.26	And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, 
EXO.30.27	and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, 
EXO.30.28	and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof. 
EXO.30.29	And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 
EXO.30.30	And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. 
EXO.30.31	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 
EXO.30.32	Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, 
EXO.30.33	Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people. 
EXO.30.34	And the 
EXO.30.35	and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure 
EXO.30.36	and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 
EXO.30.37	And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for the 
EXO.30.38	Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, he shall be cut off from his people.
EXO.31.1	And the 
EXO.31.2	See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
EXO.31.3	and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
EXO.31.4	to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
EXO.31.5	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
EXO.31.6	And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: 
EXO.31.7	the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent; 
EXO.31.8	and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense; 
EXO.31.9	and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base; 
EXO.31.10	and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office; 
EXO.31.11	and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.
EXO.31.12	And the 
EXO.31.13	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the 
EXO.31.14	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
EXO.31.15	Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the 
EXO.31.16	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
EXO.31.17	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the 
EXO.31.18	And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
EXO.32.1	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 
EXO.32.3	And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
EXO.32.5	And when Aaron saw 
EXO.32.6	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	And the 
EXO.32.8	they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
EXO.32.9	And the 
EXO.32.10	now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
EXO.32.11	And Moses besought the 
EXO.32.12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 
EXO.32.14	And the 
EXO.32.15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 
EXO.32.16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
EXO.32.17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 
EXO.32.18	And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. 
EXO.32.19	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
EXO.32.20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
EXO.32.21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them? 
EXO.32.22	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are 
EXO.32.23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 
EXO.32.24	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off; so they gave it me: and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 
EXO.32.25	And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose; for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies: 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on the 
EXO.32.27	And he said unto them, Thus saith the 
EXO.32.28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
EXO.32.29	And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to the 
EXO.32.30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the 
EXO.32.31	And Moses returned unto the 
EXO.32.32	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
EXO.32.33	And the 
EXO.32.34	And now go, lead the people unto 
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.1	And the 
EXO.33.2	and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
EXO.33.3	unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 
EXO.33.4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	And the 
EXO.33.6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the 
EXO.33.8	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. 
EXO.33.9	And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and 
EXO.33.10	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. 
EXO.33.11	And the 
EXO.33.12	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 
EXO.33.14	And he said, My presence shall go 
EXO.33.15	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not 
EXO.33.16	For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth? 
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	And he said, Shew me, I pray thee, thy glory. 
EXO.33.19	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of the 
EXO.33.20	And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for man shall not see me and live. 
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by: 
EXO.33.23	and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back: but my face shall not be seen.
EXO.34.1	And the 
EXO.34.2	And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. 
EXO.34.3	And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 
EXO.34.4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the 
EXO.34.5	And the 
EXO.34.6	And the 
EXO.34.7	keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin: and that will by no means clear 
EXO.34.8	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 
EXO.34.9	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
EXO.34.10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the 
EXO.34.11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.34.12	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 
EXO.34.13	but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim: 
EXO.34.14	for thou shalt worship no other god: for the 
EXO.34.15	lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
EXO.34.16	and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 
EXO.34.17	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
EXO.34.18	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 
EXO.34.19	All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of ox and sheep. 
EXO.34.20	And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. 
EXO.34.21	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 
EXO.34.22	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, 
EXO.34.23	Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord 
EXO.34.24	For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the 
EXO.34.25	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 
EXO.34.26	The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of the 
EXO.34.27	And the 
EXO.34.28	And he was there with the 
EXO.34.29	And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him. 
EXO.34.30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
EXO.34.31	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them. 
EXO.34.32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the 
EXO.34.33	And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. 
EXO.34.34	But when Moses went in before the 
EXO.34.35	and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
EXO.35.1	And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which the 
EXO.35.2	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to the 
EXO.35.3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. 
EXO.35.4	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the 
EXO.35.5	Take ye from among you an offering unto the 
EXO.35.6	and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' 
EXO.35.7	and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood; 
EXO.35.8	and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; 
EXO.35.9	and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 
EXO.35.10	And let every wise hearted man among you come, and make all that the 
EXO.35.11	the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
EXO.35.12	the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen; 
EXO.35.13	the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the shewbread; 
EXO.35.14	the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
EXO.35.15	and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; 
EXO.35.17	the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 
EXO.35.18	the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords; 
EXO.35.19	the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
EXO.35.20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
EXO.35.21	And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, 
EXO.35.22	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, 
EXO.35.23	And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' 
EXO.35.24	Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the 
EXO.35.25	And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. 
EXO.35.26	And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' 
EXO.35.27	And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 
EXO.35.28	and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
EXO.35.29	The children of Israel brought a freewill offering unto the 
EXO.35.30	And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the 
EXO.35.31	and he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
EXO.35.32	and to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
EXO.35.33	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of cunning workmanship. 
EXO.35.34	And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
EXO.35.35	Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise cunning works.
EXO.36.1	And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise hearted man, in whom the 
EXO.36.2	And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the 
EXO.36.3	and they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him freewill offerings every morning. 
EXO.36.4	And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought; 
EXO.36.5	and they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the 
EXO.36.6	And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 
EXO.36.7	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
EXO.36.8	And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the cunning workman made he them. 
EXO.36.9	The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure. 
EXO.36.10	And he coupled five curtains one to another: and 
EXO.36.11	And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling. 
EXO.36.12	Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another. 
EXO.36.13	And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one.
EXO.36.14	And he made curtains of goats' 
EXO.36.15	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure. 
EXO.36.16	And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
EXO.36.17	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was 
EXO.36.18	And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
EXO.36.19	And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above. 
EXO.36.20	And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up. 
EXO.36.21	Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. 
EXO.36.22	Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.23	And he made the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 
EXO.36.24	and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
EXO.36.25	And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 
EXO.36.26	and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
EXO.36.27	And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
EXO.36.28	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. 
EXO.36.29	And they were double beneath, and in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners. 
EXO.36.30	And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.

EXO.36.35	And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim the work of the cunning workman made he it. 
EXO.36.36	And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 
EXO.36.37	And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; 
EXO.36.38	and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: and their five sockets were of brass.
EXO.37.1	And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: 
EXO.37.2	and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

EXO.37.4	And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
EXO.37.6	And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half 
EXO.37.7	And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat; 
EXO.37.8	one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof. 
EXO.37.9	And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.

EXO.37.18	and there were six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: 
EXO.37.19	three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.

EXO.38.22	And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the 
EXO.38.23	And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 
EXO.38.24	All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
EXO.38.25	And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

EXO.39.3	And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the cunning workman. 
EXO.39.4	They made shoulderpieces for it, joined together: at the two ends was it joined together. 
EXO.39.5	And the cunningly woven band, that was upon it, to gird it on withal, was of the same piece 
EXO.39.6	And they wrought the onyx stones, enclosed in ouches of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel. 
EXO.39.7	And he put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; as the 
EXO.39.8	And he made the breastplate, the work of the cunning workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
EXO.39.9	It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double. 
EXO.39.10	And they set in it four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row. 
EXO.39.11	And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 
EXO.39.12	And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.

EXO.39.14	And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes. 
EXO.39.15	And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold. 
EXO.39.16	And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
EXO.39.17	And they put the two wreathen chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.

EXO.39.20	And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulderpieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the cunningly woven band of the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the cunningly woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the 
EXO.39.22	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; 
EXO.39.23	and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent. 
EXO.39.24	And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, 
EXO.39.25	And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates; 
EXO.39.26	a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as the 
EXO.39.27	And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,

EXO.39.29	and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as the 
EXO.39.30	And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO THE 
EXO.39.31	And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as the 
EXO.39.32	Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that the 
EXO.39.33	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets;

EXO.39.38	and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent; 
EXO.39.39	the brasen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; 
EXO.39.40	the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 
EXO.39.41	the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. 
EXO.39.42	According to all that the 
EXO.39.43	And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as the 
EXO.40.1	And the 
EXO.40.2	On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
EXO.40.3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil. 
EXO.40.4	And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 
EXO.40.5	And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.6	And thou shalt set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
EXO.40.7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 
EXO.40.8	And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. 
EXO.40.9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy. 
EXO.40.10	And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy. 
EXO.40.11	And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it. 
EXO.40.12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. 
EXO.40.13	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 
EXO.40.14	And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them: 
EXO.40.15	and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
EXO.40.16	Thus did Moses: according to all that the 
EXO.40.17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 
EXO.40.18	And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars. 
EXO.40.19	And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the 
EXO.40.20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark: 
EXO.40.21	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as the 
EXO.40.22	And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil. 
EXO.40.23	And he set the bread in order upon it before the 
EXO.40.24	And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
EXO.40.25	And he lighted the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil: 
EXO.40.27	and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as the 
EXO.40.28	And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.29	And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering; as the 
EXO.40.30	And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, to wash withal. 
EXO.40.31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat; 
EXO.40.32	when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed: as the 
EXO.40.33	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.34	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys: 
EXO.40.37	but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 
EXO.40.38	For the cloud of the 
LEV.1.1	And the 
LEV.1.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto the 
LEV.1.3	If his oblation be a burnt offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the 
LEV.1.4	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
LEV.1.5	And he shall kill the bullock before the 
LEV.1.6	And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces. 
LEV.1.7	And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire: 
LEV.1.8	and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 
LEV.1.9	but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.1.10	And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish. 
LEV.1.11	And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the 
LEV.1.12	And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 
LEV.1.13	but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.1.14	And if his oblation to the 
LEV.1.15	And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar: 
LEV.1.16	and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes: 
LEV.1.17	and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, 
LEV.2.1	And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal offering unto the 
LEV.2.2	and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn 
LEV.2.3	and that which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the 
LEV.2.4	And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. 
LEV.2.5	And if thy oblation be a meal offering of the baking pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 
LEV.2.6	Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal offering. 
LEV.2.7	And if thy oblation be a meal offering of the frying pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 
LEV.2.8	And thou shalt bring the meal offering that is made of these things unto the 
LEV.2.9	And the priest shall take up from the meal offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.2.10	And that which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the 
LEV.2.11	No meal offering, which ye shall offer unto the 
LEV.2.12	As an oblation of first 
LEV.2.13	And every oblation of thy meal offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt. 
LEV.2.14	And if thou offer a meal offering of firstfruits unto the 
LEV.2.15	And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal offering. 
LEV.2.16	And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.1	And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the 
LEV.3.2	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
LEV.3.3	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.4	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. 
LEV.3.5	And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.3.6	And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.3.7	If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before the 
LEV.3.8	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 
LEV.3.9	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.10	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. 
LEV.3.11	And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.12	And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before the 
LEV.3.13	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 
LEV.3.14	And he shall offer thereof his oblation, 
LEV.3.15	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. 
LEV.3.16	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour: all the fat is the 
LEV.3.17	It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.
LEV.4.1	And the 
LEV.4.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which the 
LEV.4.3	if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people; then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the 
LEV.4.4	And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before the 
LEV.4.5	And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting: 
LEV.4.6	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the 
LEV.4.7	And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the 
LEV.4.8	And all the fat of the bullock of the sin offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
LEV.4.9	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away, 
LEV.4.10	as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.11	And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, 
LEV.4.12	even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.
LEV.4.13	And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which the 
LEV.4.14	when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting. 
LEV.4.15	And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the 
LEV.4.16	And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting: 
LEV.4.17	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the 
LEV.4.18	And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the 
LEV.4.19	And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar. 
LEV.4.20	Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. 
LEV.4.21	And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin offering for the assembly.
LEV.4.22	When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which the 
LEV.4.23	if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish; 
LEV.4.24	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the 
LEV.4.25	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.26	And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
LEV.4.27	And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which the 
LEV.4.28	if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. 
LEV.4.29	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.30	And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. 
LEV.4.31	And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.4.32	And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. 
LEV.4.33	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 
LEV.4.34	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar: 
LEV.4.35	and all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of the 
LEV.5.1	And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter 
LEV.5.2	or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcase of an unclean beast, or the carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty: 
LEV.5.3	or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty: 
LEV.5.4	or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these 
LEV.5.5	and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these 
LEV.5.6	and he shall bring his guilt offering unto the 
LEV.5.7	And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his guilt offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the 
LEV.5.8	And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder: 
LEV.5.9	and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering. 
LEV.5.10	And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance: and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. 
LEV.5.11	But if his means suffice not for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering. 
LEV.5.12	And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of the 
LEV.5.13	And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and 
LEV.5.14	And the 
LEV.5.15	If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of the 
LEV.5.16	and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven. 
LEV.5.17	And if any one sin, and do any of the things which the 
LEV.5.18	And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a guilt offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven. 
LEV.5.19	It is a guilt offering: he is certainly guilty before the 
LEV.6.1	And the 
LEV.6.2	If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the 
LEV.6.3	or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely thereto, and swear to a lie; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 
LEV.6.4	then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, 
LEV.6.5	or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty. 
LEV.6.6	And he shall bring his guilt offering unto the 
LEV.6.7	and the priest shall make atonement for him before the 
LEV.6.8	And the 
LEV.6.9	Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon. 
LEV.6.10	And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 
LEV.6.11	And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 
LEV.6.12	And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings. 
LEV.6.13	Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.
LEV.6.14	And this is the law of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the 
LEV.6.15	And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, as the memorial thereof, unto the 
LEV.6.16	And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. 
LEV.6.17	It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering. 
LEV.6.18	Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the 
LEV.6.19	And the 
LEV.6.20	This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the 
LEV.6.21	On a baking pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal offering for a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.6.22	And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto the 
LEV.6.23	And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
LEV.6.24	And the 
LEV.6.25	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the 
LEV.6.26	The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting. 
LEV.6.27	Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. 
LEV.6.28	But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. 
LEV.6.29	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy. 
LEV.6.30	And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.7.1	And this is the law of the guilt offering: it is most holy. 
LEV.7.2	In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the guilt offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about. 
LEV.7.3	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 
LEV.7.4	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away: 
LEV.7.5	and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.7.6	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy. 
LEV.7.7	As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it. 
LEV.7.8	And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered. 
LEV.7.9	And every meal offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying pan, and on the baking pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it. 
LEV.7.10	And every meal offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.
LEV.7.11	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which one shall offer unto the 
LEV.7.12	If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked. 
LEV.7.13	With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving. 
LEV.7.14	And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for an heave offering unto the 
LEV.7.15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 
LEV.7.16	But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten: 
LEV.7.17	but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 
LEV.7.18	And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 
LEV.7.19	And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof: 
LEV.7.20	but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the 
LEV.7.21	And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the 
LEV.7.22	And the 
LEV.7.23	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. 
LEV.7.24	And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. 
LEV.7.25	For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.7.26	And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 
LEV.7.27	Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
LEV.7.28	And the 
LEV.7.29	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the 
LEV.7.30	his own hands shall bring the offerings of the 
LEV.7.31	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 
LEV.7.32	And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
LEV.7.33	He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. 
LEV.7.34	For the wave breast and the heave thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel.
LEV.7.35	This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of the 
LEV.7.36	which the 
LEV.7.37	This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings; 
LEV.7.38	which the 
LEV.8.1	And the 
LEV.8.2	Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 
LEV.8.3	and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting. 
LEV.8.4	And Moses did as the 
LEV.8.5	And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the 
LEV.8.6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
LEV.8.7	And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the cunningly woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. 
LEV.8.8	And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. 
LEV.8.9	And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as the 
LEV.8.10	And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. 
LEV.8.11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them. 
LEV.8.12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 
LEV.8.13	And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound headtires upon them; as the 
LEV.8.14	And he brought the bullock of the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. 
LEV.8.16	And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the 
LEV.8.18	And he presented the ram of the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	And he killed it: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 
LEV.8.20	And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 
LEV.8.21	And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt offering for a sweet savour: it was an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.8.22	And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.23	And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
LEV.8.24	And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 
LEV.8.25	And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh: 
LEV.8.26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the 
LEV.8.27	and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.28	And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savour: it was an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.8.29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.30	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
LEV.8.31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 
LEV.8.32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 
LEV.8.33	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days. 
LEV.8.34	As hath been done this day, so the 
LEV.8.35	And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the 
LEV.8.36	And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the 
LEV.9.1	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
LEV.9.2	and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a bull calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the 
LEV.9.3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 
LEV.9.4	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the 
LEV.9.5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the 
LEV.9.6	And Moses said, This is the thing which the 
LEV.9.7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as the 
LEV.9.8	So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
LEV.9.9	And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar: 
LEV.9.10	but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the 
LEV.9.11	And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp. 
LEV.9.12	And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about. 
LEV.9.13	And they delivered the burnt offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. 
LEV.9.14	And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar. 
LEV.9.15	And he presented the people's oblation, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. 
LEV.9.16	And he presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. 
LEV.9.17	And he presented the meal offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning. 
LEV.9.18	He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about, 
LEV.9.19	and the fat of the ox; and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth 
LEV.9.20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 
LEV.9.21	and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the 
LEV.9.22	And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
LEV.9.23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	And there came forth fire from before the 
LEV.10.1	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the 
LEV.10.2	And there came forth fire from before the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the 
LEV.10.4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. 
LEV.10.5	So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. 
LEV.10.6	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the 
LEV.10.7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the 
LEV.10.8	And the 
LEV.10.9	Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations: 
LEV.10.10	and that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 
LEV.10.11	and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the 
LEV.10.12	And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal offering that remaineth of the offerings of the 
LEV.10.13	and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the offerings of the 
LEV.10.14	And the wave breast and the heave thigh shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy due, and thy sons' due, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
LEV.10.15	The heave thigh and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.10.16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying, 
LEV.10.17	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the 
LEV.10.18	Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded. 
LEV.10.19	And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the 
LEV.10.20	And when Moses heard 
LEV.11.1	And the 
LEV.11.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 
LEV.11.3	Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, 
LEV.11.4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. 
LEV.11.5	And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. 
LEV.11.6	And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you. 
LEV.11.7	And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you. 
LEV.11.8	Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcases ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.
LEV.11.9	These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. 
LEV.11.10	And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you, 
LEV.11.11	and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcases ye shall have in abomination. 
LEV.11.12	Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you. 
LEV.11.13	And these ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier eagle, and the ospray; 
LEV.11.14	and the kite, and the falcon after its kind; 
LEV.11.15	every raven after its kind; 
LEV.11.16	and the ostrich, and the night hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind; 
LEV.11.17	and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl; 
LEV.11.18	and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture; 
LEV.11.19	and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
LEV.11.20	All winged creeping things that go upon all four are an abomination unto you. 
LEV.11.21	Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; 
LEV.11.22	even these of them ye may eat; the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind. 
LEV.11.23	But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you. 
LEV.11.24	And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even: 
LEV.11.25	And whosoever beareth 
LEV.11.26	Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. 
LEV.11.27	And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all four, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 
LEV.11.28	And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you. 
LEV.11.29	And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind, 
LEV.11.30	and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon. 
LEV.11.31	These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.

LEV.16.16	and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. 
LEV.16.17	And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. 
LEV.16.18	And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the 
LEV.16.19	And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.
LEV.16.20	And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat: 
LEV.16.21	and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness: 
LEV.16.22	and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 
LEV.16.23	And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: 
LEV.16.24	and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. 
LEV.16.25	And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 
LEV.16.26	And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. 
LEV.16.27	And the bullock of the sin offering, and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 
LEV.16.28	And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
LEV.16.29	And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the homeborn, or the stranger that sojourneth among you: 
LEV.16.30	for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the 
LEV.16.31	It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever. 
LEV.16.32	And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments: 
LEV.16.33	and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. 
LEV.16.34	And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as the 
LEV.17.1	And the 
LEV.17.2	Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the 
LEV.17.3	What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp, 
LEV.17.4	and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto the 
LEV.17.5	To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the 
LEV.17.6	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the 
LEV.17.7	And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after whom they go a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. 
LEV.17.8	And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 
LEV.17.9	and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto the 
LEV.17.10	And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood; I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 
LEV.17.11	For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life. 
LEV.17.12	Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. 
LEV.17.13	And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, which taketh in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. 
LEV.17.14	For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is 
LEV.17.15	And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be homeborn or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. 
LEV.17.16	But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.18.1	And the 
LEV.18.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the 
LEV.18.3	After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their statutes. 
LEV.18.4	My judgements shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the 
LEV.18.5	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgements: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the 
LEV.18.6	None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover 
LEV.18.7	The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
LEV.18.8	The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. 
LEV.18.9	The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 
LEV.18.10	The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness. 
LEV.18.11	The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
LEV.18.12	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. 
LEV.18.13	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. 
LEV.18.14	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. 
LEV.18.15	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
LEV.18.16	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. 
LEV.18.17	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness. 
LEV.18.18	And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival 
LEV.18.19	And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. 
LEV.18.20	And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her. 
LEV.18.21	And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through 
LEV.18.22	Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. 
LEV.18.23	And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion. 
LEV.18.24	Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you: 
LEV.18.25	And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants. 
LEV.18.26	Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and my judgements, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the homeborn, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you: 
LEV.18.27	(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) 
LEV.18.28	that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. 
LEV.18.29	For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. 
LEV.18.30	Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the 
LEV.19.1	And the 
LEV.19.2	Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the 
LEV.19.3	Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am the 
LEV.19.4	Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the 
LEV.19.5	And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.19.6	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire. 
LEV.19.7	And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted: 
LEV.19.8	but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the 
LEV.19.9	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. 
LEV.19.10	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the 
LEV.19.11	Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. 
LEV.19.12	And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the 
LEV.19.13	Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. 
LEV.19.14	Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the 
LEV.19.15	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgement: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 
LEV.19.16	Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the 
LEV.19.17	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 
LEV.19.18	Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the 
LEV.19.19	Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together. 
LEV.19.20	And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 
LEV.19.21	And he shall bring his guilt offering unto the 
LEV.19.22	And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the 
LEV.19.23	And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten. 
LEV.19.24	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the 
LEV.19.25	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the 
LEV.19.26	Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury. 
LEV.19.27	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 
LEV.19.28	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the 
LEV.19.29	Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
LEV.19.30	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.19.31	Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the 
LEV.19.32	Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the 
LEV.19.33	And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. 
LEV.19.34	The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the homeborn among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.19.35	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgement, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 
LEV.19.36	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the 
LEV.19.37	And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my judgements, and do them: I am the 
LEV.20.1	And the 
LEV.20.2	Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 
LEV.20.3	I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
LEV.20.4	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death: 
LEV.20.5	then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 
LEV.20.6	And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
LEV.20.7	Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the 
LEV.20.8	And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the 
LEV.20.9	For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
LEV.20.10	And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 
LEV.20.11	And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
LEV.20.12	And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. 
LEV.20.13	And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
LEV.20.14	And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. 
LEV.20.15	And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. 
LEV.20.16	And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
LEV.20.17	And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. 
LEV.20.18	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 
LEV.20.19	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. 
LEV.20.20	And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 
LEV.20.21	And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
LEV.20.22	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgements, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out. 
LEV.20.23	And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 
LEV.20.24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am the 
LEV.20.25	Ye shall therefore separate between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean. 
LEV.20.26	And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the 
LEV.20.27	A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.21.1	And the 
LEV.21.2	except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother; 
LEV.21.3	and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, which hath had no husband, for her may he defile himself. 
LEV.21.4	He shall not defile himself, 
LEV.21.5	They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
LEV.21.6	They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the 
LEV.21.7	They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. 
LEV.21.8	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the 
LEV.21.9	And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.21.10	And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; 
LEV.21.11	neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
LEV.21.12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the 
LEV.21.13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
LEV.21.14	A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, an harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. 
LEV.21.15	And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am the 
LEV.21.16	And the 
LEV.21.17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. 
LEV.21.18	For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, 
LEV.21.19	or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 
LEV.21.20	or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
LEV.21.21	no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the 
LEV.21.22	He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. 
LEV.21.23	Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am the 
LEV.21.24	So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
LEV.22.1	And the 
LEV.22.2	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am the 
LEV.22.3	Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the 
LEV.22.4	What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; 
LEV.22.5	or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 
LEV.22.6	the soul which toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. 
LEV.22.7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. 
LEV.22.8	That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the 
LEV.22.9	They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am the 
LEV.22.10	There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. 
LEV.22.11	But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread. 
LEV.22.12	And if a priest's daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things. 
LEV.22.13	But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. 
LEV.22.14	And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing. 
LEV.22.15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the 
LEV.22.16	and 
LEV.22.17	And the 
LEV.22.18	Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings, which they offer unto the 
LEV.22.19	that ye may be accepted, 
LEV.22.20	But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. 
LEV.22.21	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.22.22	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the 
LEV.22.23	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 
LEV.22.24	That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto the 
LEV.22.25	Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you. 
LEV.22.26	And the 
LEV.22.27	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.22.28	And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day. 
LEV.22.29	And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the 
LEV.22.30	On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the 
LEV.22.31	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the 
LEV.22.32	And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the 
LEV.22.33	that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the 
LEV.23.1	And the 
LEV.23.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of the 
LEV.23.3	Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto the 
LEV.23.4	These are the set feasts of the 
LEV.23.5	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is the 
LEV.23.6	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the 
LEV.23.7	In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. 
LEV.23.8	But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.9	And the 
LEV.23.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 
LEV.23.11	and he shall wave the sheaf before the 
LEV.23.12	And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.13	And the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth parts 
LEV.23.14	And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV.23.15	And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete: 
LEV.23.16	even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal offering unto the 
LEV.23.17	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth parts 
LEV.23.18	And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.19	And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
LEV.23.20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the 
LEV.23.21	And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 
LEV.23.22	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the 
LEV.23.23	And the 
LEV.23.24	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 
LEV.23.25	Ye shall do no servile work: and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.26	And the 
LEV.23.27	Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.28	And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the 
LEV.23.29	For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. 
LEV.23.30	And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. 
LEV.23.31	Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
LEV.23.32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
LEV.23.33	And the 
LEV.23.34	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the 
LEV.23.35	On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. 
LEV.23.36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.37	These are the set feasts of the 
LEV.23.38	beside the sabbaths of the 
LEV.23.39	Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the 
LEV.23.40	And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the 
LEV.23.41	And ye shall keep it a feast unto the 
LEV.23.42	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are homeborn in Israel shall dwell in booths: 
LEV.23.43	that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.23.44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of the 
LEV.24.1	And the 
LEV.24.2	Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 
LEV.24.3	Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it from evening to morning before the 
LEV.24.4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the 
LEV.24.5	And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts 
LEV.24.6	And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the 
LEV.24.7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.24.8	Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the 
LEV.24.9	And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the 
LEV.24.10	And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 
LEV.24.11	and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed: and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 
LEV.24.12	And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of the 
LEV.24.13	And the 
LEV.24.14	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 
LEV.24.15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 
LEV.24.16	And he that blasphemeth the name of the 
LEV.24.17	And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death; 
LEV.24.18	and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good: life for life. 
LEV.24.19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; 
LEV.24.20	breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. 
LEV.24.21	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. 
LEV.24.22	Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for the homeborn: for I am the 
LEV.24.23	And Moses spake to the children of Israel, and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the 
LEV.25.1	And the 
LEV.25.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the 
LEV.25.3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof; 
LEV.25.4	but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto the 
LEV.25.5	That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. 
LEV.25.6	And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourn with thee; 
LEV.25.7	and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.
LEV.25.8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. 
LEV.25.9	Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. 
LEV.25.10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 
LEV.25.11	A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather 
LEV.25.12	For it is a jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. 
LEV.25.13	In this year of jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession. 
LEV.25.14	And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not wrong one another: 
LEV.25.15	according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, 
LEV.25.16	According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee. 
LEV.25.17	And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the 
LEV.25.18	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgements and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 
LEV.25.19	And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 
LEV.25.20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
LEV.25.21	then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years. 
LEV.25.22	And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until her fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.
LEV.25.23	And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. 
LEV.25.24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. 
LEV.25.25	If thy brother be waxen poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. 
LEV.25.26	And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxen rich and find sufficient to redeem it; 
LEV.25.27	then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession. 
LEV.25.28	But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. 
LEV.25.29	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption. 
LEV.25.30	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. 
LEV.25.31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. 
LEV.25.32	Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. 
LEV.25.33	And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 
LEV.25.34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession. 
LEV.25.35	And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: 
LEV.25.36	Take thou no usury of him or increase; but fear thy God: that thy brother may live with thee. 
LEV.25.37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor give him thy victuals for increase. 
LEV.25.38	I am the 
LEV.25.39	And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant: 
LEV.25.40	as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubile: 
LEV.25.41	then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. 
LEV.25.42	For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. 
LEV.25.43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. 
LEV.25.44	And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 
LEV.25.45	Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession. 
LEV.25.46	And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigour. 
LEV.25.47	And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxen rich, and thy brother be waxen poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger 
LEV.25.48	after that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him: 
LEV.25.49	or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxen rich, he may redeem himself. 
LEV.25.50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of an hired servant shall he be with him. 
LEV.25.51	If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 
LEV.25.52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. 
LEV.25.53	As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 
LEV.25.54	And if he be not redeemed by these 
LEV.25.55	For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.26.1	Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the 
LEV.26.2	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.26.3	If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 
LEV.26.4	then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
LEV.26.5	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 
LEV.26.6	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 
LEV.26.7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.8	And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall chase ten thousand: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.9	And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish my covenant with you. 
LEV.26.10	And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new. 
LEV.26.11	And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 
LEV.26.12	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 
LEV.26.13	I am the 
LEV.26.14	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 
LEV.26.15	and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my judgements, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant; 
LEV.26.16	I also will do this unto you; I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 
LEV.26.17	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 
LEV.26.18	And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 
LEV.26.19	And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 
LEV.26.20	and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. 
LEV.26.21	And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 
LEV.26.22	And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate. 
LEV.26.23	And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me; 
LEV.26.24	then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 
LEV.26.26	When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 
LEV.26.27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 
LEV.26.28	then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 
LEV.26.30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you. 
LEV.26.31	And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 
LEV.26.32	And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 
LEV.26.33	And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. 
LEV.26.34	Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 
LEV.26.35	As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 
LEV.26.36	And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 
LEV.26.37	And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 
LEV.26.38	And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 
LEV.26.39	And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
LEV.26.40	And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that because they have walked contrary unto me, 
LEV.26.41	I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; 
LEV.26.42	then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 
LEV.26.43	The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they rejected my judgements, and their soul abhorred my statutes. 
LEV.26.44	And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the 
LEV.26.45	but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the 
LEV.26.46	These are the statutes and judgements and laws, which the 
LEV.27.1	And the 
LEV.27.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for the 
LEV.27.3	And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
LEV.27.4	And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. 
LEV.27.5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
LEV.27.6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. 
LEV.27.7	And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
LEV.27.8	But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him. 
LEV.27.9	And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto the 
LEV.27.10	He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. 
LEV.27.11	And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto the 
LEV.27.12	and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be. 
LEV.27.13	But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
LEV.27.14	And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the 
LEV.27.15	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. 
LEV.27.16	And if a man shall sanctify unto the 
LEV.27.17	If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand. 
LEV.27.18	But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubile, and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation. 
LEV.27.19	And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. 
LEV.27.20	And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more: 
LEV.27.21	but the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the 
LEV.27.22	And if he sanctify unto the 
LEV.27.23	then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the 
LEV.27.24	In the year of jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth. 
LEV.27.25	And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
LEV.27.26	Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to the 
LEV.27.27	And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. 
LEV.27.28	Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the 
LEV.27.29	None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death. 
LEV.27.30	And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the 
LEV.27.31	And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof. 
LEV.27.32	And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the 
LEV.27.33	He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. 
LEV.27.34	These are the commandments, which the 
NUM.1.1	And the 
NUM.1.2	Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, every male, by their polls;

NUM.5.4	And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the 
NUM.5.5	And the 
NUM.5.6	Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the 
NUM.5.7	then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty.

NUM.5.11	And the

NUM.5.14	and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: 
NUM.5.15	then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. 
NUM.5.16	And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the 
NUM.5.17	and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:

NUM.5.19	and the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse: 
NUM.5.20	but if thou hast gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thine husband: 
NUM.5.21	then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The 
NUM.5.22	and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to fall away: and the woman shall say, Amen, Amen. 
NUM.5.23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness: 
NUM.5.24	and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her 
NUM.5.25	And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before the 
NUM.5.26	and the priest shall take an handful of the meal offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. 
NUM.5.27	And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her 
NUM.5.28	And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. 
NUM.5.29	This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled; 
NUM.5.30	or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he be jealous over his wife; then shall he set the woman before the 
NUM.5.31	And the man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.
NUM.6.1	And the 
NUM.6.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto the 
NUM.6.3	he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. 
NUM.6.4	All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk. 
NUM.6.5	All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the 
NUM.6.6	All the days that he separateth himself unto the 
NUM.6.7	He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because his separation unto God is upon his head. 
NUM.6.8	All the days of his separation he is holy unto the 
NUM.6.9	And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 
NUM.6.10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting: 
NUM.6.11	and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. 
NUM.6.12	And he shall separate unto the 
NUM.6.13	And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting: 
NUM.6.14	and he shall offer his oblation unto the 
NUM.6.15	and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings. 
NUM.6.16	And the priest shall present them before the 
NUM.6.17	and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
NUM.6.18	And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings. 
NUM.6.19	And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven 
NUM.6.20	and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the 
NUM.6.21	This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, 
NUM.6.22	And the 
NUM.6.23	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say unto them, 
NUM.6.24	The 
NUM.6.25	The 
NUM.6.26	The 
NUM.6.27	So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.
NUM.7.1	And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them; 
NUM.7.2	that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered; these were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered: 
NUM.7.3	and they brought their oblation before the 
NUM.7.4	And the 
NUM.7.5	Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 
NUM.7.6	And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
NUM.7.7	Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
NUM.7.8	and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

NUM.8.1	And the 
NUM.8.2	Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick. 
NUM.8.3	And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof 
NUM.8.4	And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, 
NUM.8.5	And the 
NUM.8.6	Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 
NUM.8.7	And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. 
NUM.8.8	Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal offering, fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering. 
NUM.8.9	And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel: 
NUM.8.10	and thou shalt present the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the 
NUM.8.13	And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave offering unto the 
NUM.8.14	Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. 
NUM.8.15	And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave offering. 
NUM.8.16	For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. 
NUM.8.17	For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 
NUM.8.18	And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel. 
NUM.8.19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

NUM.8.22	And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as the 
NUM.8.23	And the 
NUM.8.24	This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting: 
NUM.8.25	and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more; 
NUM.8.26	but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.
NUM.9.1	And the 
NUM.9.2	Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. 
NUM.9.3	In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it. 
NUM.9.4	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 
NUM.9.5	And they kept the passover in the first 
NUM.9.6	And there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 
NUM.9.7	and those men said unto him, We are unclean by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of the 
NUM.9.8	And Moses said unto them, Stay ye; that I may hear what the 
NUM.9.9	And the 
NUM.9.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the 
NUM.9.11	in the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs: 
NUM.9.12	they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. 
NUM.9.13	But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people: because he offered not the oblation of the 
NUM.9.14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the 
NUM.9.15	And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. 
NUM.9.16	So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. 
NUM.9.17	And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. 
NUM.9.18	At the commandment of the 
NUM.9.19	And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the 
NUM.9.20	And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of the 
NUM.9.21	And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or 
NUM.9.22	Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 
NUM.9.23	At the commandment of the 
NUM.10.1	And the 
NUM.10.2	Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps. 
NUM.10.3	And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.10.4	And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. 
NUM.10.5	And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey. 
NUM.10.6	And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 
NUM.10.7	But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 
NUM.10.8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations. 
NUM.10.9	And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the 
NUM.10.10	Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the 
NUM.10.11	And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. 
NUM.10.12	And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran. 
NUM.10.13	And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the 
NUM.10.14	And in the first 
NUM.10.15	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
NUM.10.16	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. 
NUM.10.17	And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set forward. 
NUM.10.18	And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
NUM.10.19	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
NUM.10.20	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 
NUM.10.21	And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and 
NUM.10.22	And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. 
NUM.10.23	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
NUM.10.24	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
NUM.10.25	And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 
NUM.10.26	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. 
NUM.10.27	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 
NUM.10.28	Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts; and they set forward.
NUM.10.29	And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the 
NUM.10.30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. 
NUM.10.31	And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. 
NUM.10.32	And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the 
NUM.10.33	And they set forward from the mount of the 
NUM.10.34	And the cloud of the 
NUM.10.35	And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O 
NUM.10.36	And when it rested, he said, Return, O 
NUM.11.1	And the people were as murmurers, 
NUM.11.2	And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the 
NUM.11.3	And the name of that place was called Taberah: because the fire of the 
NUM.11.4	And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 
NUM.11.6	but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all: we have nought save this manna to look to. 
NUM.11.7	And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. 
NUM.11.8	The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. 
NUM.11.9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 
NUM.11.10	And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of the 
NUM.11.11	And Moses said unto the 
NUM.11.12	Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
NUM.11.13	Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 
NUM.11.15	And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
NUM.11.16	And the 
NUM.11.17	And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. 
NUM.11.18	And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the 
NUM.11.19	Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 
NUM.11.20	but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have rejected the 
NUM.11.21	And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 
NUM.11.22	Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? 
NUM.11.23	And the 
NUM.11.24	And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	And the 
NUM.11.26	But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent: and they prophesied in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. 
NUM.11.28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 
NUM.11.29	And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would God that all the 
NUM.11.30	And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
NUM.11.31	And there went forth a wind from the 
NUM.11.32	And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 
NUM.11.33	While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the 
NUM.11.34	And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. 
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married: for he had married a Cushite woman. 
NUM.12.2	And they said, Hath the 
NUM.12.3	Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.
NUM.12.4	And the 
NUM.12.5	And the 
NUM.12.6	And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I the 
NUM.12.7	My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all mine house: 
NUM.12.8	with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of the 
NUM.12.9	And the anger of the 
NUM.12.10	And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as 
NUM.12.11	And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned. 
NUM.12.12	Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb. 
NUM.12.13	And Moses cried unto the 
NUM.12.14	And the 
NUM.12.15	And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. 
NUM.12.16	And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	And the 
NUM.13.2	Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them. 
NUM.13.3	And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of the 
NUM.13.4	And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 
NUM.13.5	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 
NUM.13.6	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
NUM.13.7	Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 
NUM.13.8	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. 
NUM.13.9	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
NUM.13.10	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 
NUM.13.11	Of the tribe of Joseph, 
NUM.13.12	Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
NUM.13.13	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
NUM.13.14	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
NUM.13.15	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. 
NUM.13.17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the mountains: 
NUM.13.18	and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, whether they be few or many; 
NUM.13.19	and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strong holds; 
NUM.13.20	and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entering in of Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence. 
NUM.13.25	And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
NUM.13.26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. 
NUM.13.27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. 
NUM.13.28	Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fenced, 
NUM.13.29	Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of Jordan. 
NUM.13.30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 
NUM.13.31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. 
NUM.13.32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. 
NUM.13.33	And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, which come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
NUM.14.1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 
NUM.14.2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	And wherefore doth the 
NUM.14.4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
NUM.14.6	And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes: 
NUM.14.7	and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. 
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only rebel not against the 
NUM.14.10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the 
NUM.14.11	And the 
NUM.14.12	I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they. 
NUM.14.13	And Moses said unto the 
NUM.14.14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: they have heard that thou 
NUM.14.15	Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 
NUM.14.16	Because the 
NUM.14.17	And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 
NUM.14.18	The 
NUM.14.19	Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
NUM.14.20	And the 
NUM.14.21	but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the 
NUM.14.22	because all those men which have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
NUM.14.23	surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it: 
NUM.14.24	but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
NUM.14.25	Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea. 
NUM.14.26	And the 
NUM.14.27	How long 
NUM.14.28	Say unto them, As I live, saith the 
NUM.14.29	your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, 
NUM.14.30	surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I lifted up my hand that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
NUM.14.31	But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected. 
NUM.14.32	But as for you, your carcases shall fall in this wilderness. 
NUM.14.33	And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness. 
NUM.14.34	After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation. 
NUM.14.35	I the 
NUM.14.36	And the men, which Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, 
NUM.14.37	even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the 
NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land. 
NUM.14.39	And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 
NUM.14.40	And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the 
NUM.14.41	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the 
NUM.14.42	Go not up, for the 
NUM.14.43	For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following the 
NUM.14.44	But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the 
NUM.14.45	Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite which dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.
NUM.15.1	And the 
NUM.15.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 
NUM.15.3	and will make an offering by fire unto the 
NUM.15.4	then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto the 
NUM.15.5	and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of an hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. 
NUM.15.6	Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts 
NUM.15.7	and for the drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings unto the 
NUM.15.9	then shall he offer with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth parts 
NUM.15.10	and thou shalt offer for the drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.11	Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids. 
NUM.15.12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 
NUM.15.13	All that are homeborn shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.15	For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth 
NUM.15.16	One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. 
NUM.15.17	And the 
NUM.15.18	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 
NUM.15.19	then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the 
NUM.15.20	Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it. 
NUM.15.21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the 
NUM.15.22	And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the 
NUM.15.23	even all that the 
NUM.15.24	then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.25	And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto the 
NUM.15.26	and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly. 
NUM.15.27	And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat of the first year for a sin offering. 
NUM.15.28	And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before the 
NUM.15.29	Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is homeborn among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
NUM.15.30	But the soul that doeth aught with an high hand, whether he be homeborn or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the 
NUM.15.31	Because he hath despised the word of the 
NUM.15.32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day. 
NUM.15.33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
NUM.15.34	And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him. 
NUM.15.35	And the 
NUM.15.36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the 
NUM.15.37	And the 
NUM.15.38	Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue: 
NUM.15.39	and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the 
NUM.15.40	that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 
NUM.15.41	I am the 
NUM.16.1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took 
NUM.16.2	and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown: 
NUM.16.3	and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the 
NUM.16.4	And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 
NUM.16.5	and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning the 
NUM.16.6	This do; take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 
NUM.16.7	and put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the 
NUM.16.8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi: 
NUM.16.9	 a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself; to do the service of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.16.10	and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also? 
NUM.16.11	Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against the 
NUM.16.12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: and they said, We will not come up: 
NUM.16.13	is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us? 
NUM.16.14	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. 
NUM.16.15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy congregation before the 
NUM.16.17	and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before the 
NUM.16.18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.16.19	And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of the 
NUM.16.20	And the 
NUM.16.21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 
NUM.16.22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
NUM.16.23	And the 
NUM.16.24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 
NUM.16.25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
NUM.16.26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 
NUM.16.27	So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones. 
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 
NUM.16.32	and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. 
NUM.16.33	So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly. 
NUM.16.34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
NUM.16.35	And fire came forth from the 
NUM.16.36	And the 
NUM.16.37	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy; 
NUM.16.38	even the censers of these sinners against their own lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the 
NUM.16.39	And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar: 
NUM.16.40	to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before the 
NUM.16.41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the 
NUM.16.42	And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the 
NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.16.44	And the 
NUM.16.45	Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 
NUM.16.46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the 
NUM.16.47	And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. 
NUM.16.48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
NUM.16.49	Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. 
NUM.16.50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.
NUM.17.1	And the 
NUM.17.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. 
NUM.17.3	And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses. 
NUM.17.4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you. 
NUM.17.6	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
NUM.17.7	And Moses laid up the rods before the 
NUM.17.8	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bare ripe almonds. 
NUM.17.9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	Thus did Moses: as the 
NUM.17.12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. 
NUM.17.13	Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	And the 
NUM.18.2	And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony. 
NUM.18.3	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye. 
NUM.18.4	And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 
NUM.18.5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. 
NUM.18.6	And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto the 
NUM.18.7	And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for every thing of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
NUM.18.8	And the 
NUM.18.9	This shall be thine of the most holy things, 
NUM.18.10	As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof: every male shall eat thereof; it shall be holy unto thee. 
NUM.18.11	And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. 
NUM.18.12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the corn, the firstfruits of them which they give unto the 
NUM.18.13	The firstripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto the 
NUM.18.14	Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
NUM.18.15	Every thing that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto the 
NUM.18.16	And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs). 
NUM.18.17	But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.18.18	And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine. 
NUM.18.19	All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the 
NUM.18.20	And the 
NUM.18.21	And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.22	And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. 
NUM.18.23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
NUM.18.24	For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the 
NUM.18.25	And the 
NUM.18.26	Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the 
NUM.18.27	And your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress. 
NUM.18.28	Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the 
NUM.18.29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the 
NUM.18.30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the winepress. 
NUM.18.31	And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
NUM.19.1	And the 
NUM.19.2	This is the statute of the law which the 
NUM.19.3	and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: 
NUM.19.4	and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times: 
NUM.19.5	and one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
NUM.19.6	and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
NUM.19.7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 
NUM.19.8	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 
NUM.19.9	And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a sin offering. 
NUM.19.10	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
NUM.19.11	He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days: 
NUM.19.12	the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
NUM.19.13	Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.14	This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.15	And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. 
NUM.19.16	And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.17	And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: 
NUM.19.18	and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave: 
NUM.19.19	and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. 
NUM.19.20	But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. 
NUM.19.22	And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
NUM.20.1	And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
NUM.20.2	And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the 
NUM.20.4	And why have ye brought the assembly of the 
NUM.20.5	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. 
NUM.20.6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	And the 
NUM.20.8	Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink. 
NUM.20.9	And Moses took the rod from before the 
NUM.20.10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock? 
NUM.20.11	And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. 
NUM.20.12	And the 
NUM.20.13	These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the 
NUM.20.14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: 
NUM.20.15	how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians evil entreated us, and our fathers: 
NUM.20.16	and when we cried unto the 
NUM.20.17	let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's 
NUM.20.18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee. 
NUM.20.19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway: and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without 
NUM.20.20	And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor. 
NUM.20.23	And the 
NUM.20.24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: 
NUM.20.26	and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered 
NUM.20.27	And Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. 
NUM.20.29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
NUM.21.1	And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 
NUM.21.2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the 
NUM.21.3	And the 
NUM.21.4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
NUM.21.5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. 
NUM.21.6	And the 
NUM.21.7	And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against the 
NUM.21.8	And the 
NUM.21.9	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.
NUM.21.10	And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. 
NUM.21.12	From thence they journeyed, and pitched in the valley of Zered. 
NUM.21.13	From thence they journeyed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the 
NUM.21.15	And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab. 
NUM.21.16	And from thence 
NUM.21.17	Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: 
NUM.21.18	The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, 
NUM.21.19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.
NUM.21.21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
NUM.21.22	Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's 
NUM.21.23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz: and he fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
NUM.21.25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and established: 
NUM.21.28	For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of Arnon. 
NUM.21.29	Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.30	We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which 
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. 
NUM.21.33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
NUM.21.34	And the 
NUM.21.35	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.1	And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. 
NUM.22.2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
NUM.22.4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
NUM.22.5	And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 
NUM.22.6	come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 
NUM.22.7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
NUM.22.8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the 
NUM.22.9	And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? 
NUM.22.10	And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, 
NUM.22.11	Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out. 
NUM.22.12	And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. 
NUM.22.13	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the 
NUM.22.14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
NUM.22.15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 
NUM.22.16	And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 
NUM.22.17	for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
NUM.22.18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the 
NUM.22.19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the 
NUM.22.20	And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men be come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
NUM.22.21	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
NUM.22.22	And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	And the 
NUM.22.29	And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now I had killed thee. 
NUM.22.30	And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.33	and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive. 
NUM.22.34	And Balaam said unto the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 
NUM.22.37	And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 
NUM.22.38	And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 
NUM.22.39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 
NUM.22.41	And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.
NUM.23.1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
NUM.23.2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. 
NUM.23.3	And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go; peradventure the 
NUM.23.4	And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. 
NUM.23.5	And the 
NUM.23.6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel. 
NUM.23.8	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom the 
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: Lo, it is a people that dwell alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
NUM.23.10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his! 
NUM.23.11	And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. 
NUM.23.12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the 
NUM.23.13	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. 
NUM.23.14	And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. 
NUM.23.15	And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet 
NUM.23.16	And the 
NUM.23.17	And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the 
NUM.23.18	And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that he should lie; Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received 
NUM.23.21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: The 
NUM.23.22	God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox. 
NUM.23.23	Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob, Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! 
NUM.23.24	Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain. 
NUM.23.25	And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. 
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the 
NUM.23.27	And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 
NUM.23.28	And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. 
NUM.23.29	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
NUM.23.30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
NUM.24.1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. 
NUM.24.3	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith: 
NUM.24.4	He saith, which heareth the words of God, Which seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open: 
NUM.24.5	How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel! 
NUM.24.6	As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river side, As lign-aloes which the 
NUM.24.7	Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted. 
NUM.24.8	God bringeth him forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, And shall break their bones in pieces, And smite 
NUM.24.9	He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee.
NUM.24.10	And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. 
NUM.24.11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the 
NUM.24.12	And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 
NUM.24.13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the 
NUM.24.14	And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, 
NUM.24.15	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith: 
NUM.24.16	He saith, which heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Which seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open: 
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult. 
NUM.24.18	And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, 
NUM.24.19	And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city. 
NUM.24.20	And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction. 
NUM.24.21	And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling place, And thy nest is set in the rock. 
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. 
NUM.24.23	And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this? 
NUM.24.24	But ships 
NUM.24.25	And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
NUM.25.1	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab: 
NUM.25.2	for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 
NUM.25.3	And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the 
NUM.25.4	And the 
NUM.25.5	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor.
NUM.25.6	And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.25.7	And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand; 
NUM.25.8	and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
NUM.25.9	And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand. 
NUM.25.10	And the 
NUM.25.11	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. 
NUM.25.12	Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: 
NUM.25.13	and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel. 
NUM.25.14	Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites. 
NUM.25.15	And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.
NUM.25.16	And the 
NUM.25.17	Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 
NUM.25.18	for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.
NUM.26.1	And it came to pass after the plague, that the 
NUM.26.2	Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel. 
NUM.26.3	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

NUM.26.64	But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest; who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 
NUM.26.65	For the 
NUM.27.1	Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 
NUM.27.2	And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying, 
NUM.27.3	Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against the 
NUM.27.4	Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father. 
NUM.27.5	And Moses brought their cause before the 
NUM.27.6	And the 
NUM.27.7	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 
NUM.27.8	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. 
NUM.27.9	And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. 
NUM.27.10	And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. 
NUM.27.11	And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgement, as the 
NUM.27.12	And the 
NUM.27.13	And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered: 
NUM.27.14	because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
NUM.27.15	And Moses spake unto the 
NUM.27.16	Let the 
NUM.27.17	which may go out before them, and which may come in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the 
NUM.27.18	And the 
NUM.27.19	and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 
NUM.27.20	And thou shalt put of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey. 
NUM.27.21	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgement of the Urim before the 
NUM.27.22	And Moses did as the 
NUM.27.23	and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the 
NUM.28.1	And the 
NUM.28.2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. 
NUM.28.3	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the 
NUM.28.4	The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; 
NUM.28.5	and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. 
NUM.28.6	It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the 
NUM.28.7	And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink offering of strong drink unto the 
NUM.28.8	And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.28.9	And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts 
NUM.28.10	this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof. 
NUM.28.11	And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the 
NUM.28.12	and three tenth parts 
NUM.28.13	and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering unto every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the 
NUM.28.14	And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of an hin for the ram, and the fourth part of an hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.

NUM.28.18	In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: 
NUM.28.19	but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering unto the 
NUM.28.20	and their meal offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram; 
NUM.28.21	a several tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs; 
NUM.28.22	and one he-goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you. 
NUM.28.23	Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 
NUM.28.24	After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.28.25	And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work. 
NUM.28.26	Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye offer a new meal offering unto the

NUM.28.30	one he-goat, to make atonement for you. 
NUM.28.31	Beside the continual burnt offering, and the meal offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink offerings.
NUM.29.1	And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you. 
NUM.29.2	And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the

NUM.29.39	These ye shall offer unto the 
NUM.29.40	And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the 
NUM.30.1	And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the 
NUM.30.2	When a man voweth a vow unto the 
NUM.30.3	Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the 
NUM.30.4	and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
NUM.30.5	But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the 
NUM.30.6	And if she be 
NUM.30.7	and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
NUM.30.8	But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it; then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and the 
NUM.30.9	But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, 
NUM.30.10	And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, 
NUM.30.11	and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 
NUM.30.12	But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the 
NUM.30.13	Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
NUM.30.14	But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 
NUM.30.15	But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. 
NUM.30.16	These are the statutes, which the 
NUM.31.1	And the 
NUM.31.2	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. 
NUM.31.3	And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the 
NUM.31.4	Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. 
NUM.31.5	So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
NUM.31.6	And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
NUM.31.7	And they warred against Midian, as the 
NUM.31.8	And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain; Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 
NUM.31.9	And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. 
NUM.31.10	And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. 
NUM.31.11	And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast. 
NUM.31.12	And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
NUM.31.13	And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 
NUM.31.14	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, which came from the service of the war. 
NUM.31.15	And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 
NUM.31.16	Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the 
NUM.31.17	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. 
NUM.31.18	But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. 
NUM.31.19	And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives. 
NUM.31.20	And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' 
NUM.31.21	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which the 
NUM.31.22	howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
NUM.31.23	every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water. 
NUM.31.24	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
NUM.31.25	And the 
NUM.31.26	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' 
NUM.31.27	and divide the prey into two parts; between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation: 
NUM.31.28	and levy a tribute unto the 
NUM.31.29	take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for the 
NUM.31.30	And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, 
NUM.31.31	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the 
NUM.31.32	Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, 
NUM.31.33	and threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 
NUM.31.34	and threescore and one thousand asses, 
NUM.31.35	and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him. 
NUM.31.36	And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep: 
NUM.31.37	and the 
NUM.31.38	And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the 
NUM.31.39	And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the 
NUM.31.40	And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom the 
NUM.31.41	And Moses gave the tribute, which was the 
NUM.31.42	And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred, 
NUM.31.43	(now the congregation's half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep, 
NUM.31.44	and thirty and six thousand beeves, 
NUM.31.45	and thirty thousand and five hundred asses, 
NUM.31.46	and sixteen thousand persons;) 
NUM.31.47	even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.48	And the officers which were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: 
NUM.31.49	and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. 
NUM.31.50	And we have brought the 
NUM.31.51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. 
NUM.31.52	And all the gold of the heave offering that they offered up to the 
NUM.31.53	(
NUM.31.54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the 
NUM.32.1	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle; 
NUM.32.2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, 
NUM.32.3	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
NUM.32.4	the land which the 
NUM.32.5	And they said, If we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over Jordan. 
NUM.32.6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here? 
NUM.32.7	And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. 
NUM.32.9	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the 
NUM.32.10	And the 
NUM.32.11	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
NUM.32.12	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun: because they have wholly followed the 
NUM.32.13	And the 
NUM.32.14	And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
NUM.32.16	And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 
NUM.32.17	but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
NUM.32.18	We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 
NUM.32.19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. 
NUM.32.20	And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing; If ye will arm yourselves to go before the 
NUM.32.21	and every armed man of you will pass over Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	and the land be subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 
NUM.32.25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 
NUM.32.27	but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before the 
NUM.32.28	So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' 
NUM.32.29	And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before the 
NUM.32.30	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 
NUM.32.31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the 
NUM.32.32	We will pass over armed before the 
NUM.32.33	And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with 
NUM.32.34	And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer; 
NUM.32.35	and Atroth-shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah; 
NUM.32.36	and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fenced cities, and folds for sheep. 
NUM.32.37	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim; 
NUM.32.38	and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded. 
NUM.32.39	And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites which were therein. 
NUM.32.40	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. 
NUM.32.41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair. 
NUM.32.42	And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
NUM.33.1	These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.33.2	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the 
NUM.33.3	And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians, 
NUM.33.4	while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, which the 
NUM.33.5	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth. 
NUM.33.6	And they journeyed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.

NUM.33.13	And they journeyed from Dophkah, and pitched in Alush. 
NUM.33.14	And they journeyed from Alush, and pitched in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink. 
NUM.33.15	And they journeyed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai. 
NUM.33.16	And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai, and pitched in Kibroth-hattaavah. 
NUM.33.17	And they journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and pitched in Hazeroth. 
NUM.33.18	And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. 
NUM.33.19	And they journeyed from Rithmah, and pitched in Rimmon-perez. 
NUM.33.20	And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, and pitched in Libnah. 
NUM.33.21	And they journeyed from Libnah, and pitched in Rissah. 
NUM.33.22	And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

NUM.33.34	And they journeyed from Jotbathah, and pitched in Abronah. 
NUM.33.35	And they journeyed from Abronah, and pitched in Ezion-geber. 
NUM.33.36	And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin (the same is Kadesh). 
NUM.33.37	And they journeyed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. 
NUM.33.38	And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the 
NUM.33.39	And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor. 
NUM.33.40	And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. 
NUM.33.41	And they journeyed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 
NUM.33.42	And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 
NUM.33.43	And they journeyed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 
NUM.33.44	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched in Iye-abarim, in the border of Moab. 
NUM.33.45	And they journeyed from Iyim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. 
NUM.33.46	And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and pitched in Almon-diblathaim. 
NUM.33.47	And they journeyed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. 
NUM.33.48	And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 
NUM.33.49	And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
NUM.33.50	And the 
NUM.33.51	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
NUM.33.52	then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured 
NUM.33.53	and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein: for unto you have I given the land to possess it. 
NUM.33.54	And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit. 
NUM.33.55	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then shall those which ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
NUM.33.56	And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.
NUM.34.1	And the 
NUM.34.2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan, (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof,) 
NUM.34.3	then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward: 
NUM.34.4	and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin: and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon: 
NUM.34.5	and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea. 
NUM.34.6	And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border 
NUM.34.7	And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor: 
NUM.34.8	from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entering in of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad: 
NUM.34.9	and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border. 
NUM.34.10	And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham: 
NUM.34.11	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 
NUM.34.12	and the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea: this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about. 
NUM.34.13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the 
NUM.34.14	for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance: 
NUM.34.15	the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
NUM.34.16	And the 
NUM.34.17	These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
NUM.34.18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance. 
NUM.34.19	And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
NUM.34.20	And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. 
NUM.34.21	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 
NUM.34.22	And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli. 
NUM.34.23	Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod: 
NUM.34.24	and of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 
NUM.34.25	And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. 
NUM.34.26	And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan. 
NUM.34.27	And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 
NUM.34.28	And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. 
NUM.34.29	These are they whom the 
NUM.35.1	And the 
NUM.35.2	Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites. 
NUM.35.3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts. 
NUM.35.4	And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 
NUM.35.5	And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. 
NUM.35.6	And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee thither: and beside them ye shall give forty and two cities. 
NUM.35.7	All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them 
NUM.35.8	And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.
NUM.35.9	And the 
NUM.35.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
NUM.35.11	then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the manslayer which killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither. 
NUM.35.12	And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgement. 
NUM.35.13	And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. 
NUM.35.14	Ye shall give three cities beyond Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. 
NUM.35.15	For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge: that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither. 
NUM.35.16	But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.17	And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.18	Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.19	The avenger of blood shall himself put the manslayer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death. 
NUM.35.20	And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died; 
NUM.35.21	or in enmity smote him with his hand, that he died: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a manslayer: the avenger of blood shall put the manslayer to death, when he meeteth him. 
NUM.35.22	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him any thing without lying in wait, 
NUM.35.23	or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 
NUM.35.24	then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these judgements: 
NUM.35.25	and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 
NUM.35.26	But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth; 
NUM.35.27	and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: 
NUM.35.28	because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession. 
NUM.35.29	And these things shall be for a statute of judgement unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
NUM.35.30	Whoso killeth any person, the manslayer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die. 
NUM.35.31	Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a manslayer, which is guilty of death: but he shall surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.32	And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. 
NUM.35.33	So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land: and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 
NUM.35.34	And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I the 
NUM.36.1	And the heads of the fathers' 
NUM.36.2	and they said, The 
NUM.36.3	And if they be married to any of the sons of the 
NUM.36.4	And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
NUM.36.5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the 
NUM.36.6	This is the thing which the 
NUM.36.7	So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
NUM.36.8	And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
NUM.36.9	So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance. 
NUM.36.10	Even as the 
NUM.36.11	for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons. 
NUM.36.12	They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
NUM.36.13	These are the commandments and the judgements, which the 
DEU.1.1	These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. 
DEU.1.2	It is eleven days' 
DEU.1.3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the 
DEU.1.4	after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei: 
DEU.1.5	beyond Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 
DEU.1.6	The 
DEU.1.7	turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and unto all 
DEU.1.8	Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.1.9	And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	The 
DEU.1.12	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
DEU.1.13	Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you. 
DEU.1.14	And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good 
DEU.1.15	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear 
DEU.1.17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgement; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgement is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it. 
DEU.1.18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
DEU.1.19	And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the 
DEU.1.20	And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill country of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	Behold, the 
DEU.1.22	And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come. 
DEU.1.23	And the thing pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: 
DEU.1.24	and they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
DEU.1.25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the 
DEU.1.26	Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.27	and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the 
DEU.1.28	Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fenced up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there. 
DEU.1.29	Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the 
DEU.1.32	Yet in this thing ye did not believe the 
DEU.1.33	who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day. 
DEU.1.34	And the 
DEU.1.35	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 
DEU.1.36	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children: because he hath wholly followed the 
DEU.1.37	Also the 
DEU.1.38	Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
DEU.1.39	Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea. 
DEU.1.41	Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	And the 
DEU.1.43	So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.44	And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	And ye returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode 
DEU.2.1	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the 
DEU.2.2	And the 
DEU.2.3	Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 
DEU.2.4	And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 
DEU.2.5	contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on: because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. 
DEU.2.6	Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
DEU.2.9	And the 
DEU.2.10	(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim: 
DEU.2.11	these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
DEU.2.12	The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the 
DEU.2.13	Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. 
DEU.2.14	And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the 
DEU.2.15	Moreover the hand of the 
DEU.2.16	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
DEU.2.17	that the 
DEU.2.18	Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: 
DEU.2.19	and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession: because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. 
DEU.2.20	(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim; 
DEU.2.21	a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the 
DEU.2.22	as he did for the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 
DEU.2.23	and the Avvim which dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
DEU.2.24	Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
DEU.2.25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. 
DEU.2.26	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
DEU.2.27	Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
DEU.2.28	Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet; 
DEU.2.29	as the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the 
DEU.2.31	And the 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	And the 
DEU.2.34	And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining: 
DEU.2.35	only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. 
DEU.2.36	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and 
DEU.2.37	only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wheresoever the 
DEU.3.1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	And the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were cities fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many. 
DEU.3.6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
DEU.3.7	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves. 
DEU.3.8	And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 
DEU.3.9	(
DEU.3.10	all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)
DEU.3.12	And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites: 
DEU.3.13	and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.) 
DEU.3.15	And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
DEU.3.16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border 
DEU.3.17	the Arabah also, and Jordan and the border 
DEU.3.18	And I commanded you at that time, saying, The 
DEU.3.19	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; 
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.3.22	Ye shall not fear them: for the 
DEU.3.23	And I besought the 
DEU.3.24	O Lord 
DEU.3.25	Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
DEU.3.28	But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. 
DEU.3.29	So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the judgements, which I teach you, for to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.4.2	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the 
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	But ye that did cleave unto the 
DEU.4.5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgements, even as the 
DEU.4.6	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. 
DEU.4.7	For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as the 
DEU.4.8	And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and judgements so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? 
DEU.4.9	Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children's children; 
DEU.4.10	the day that thou stoodest before the 
DEU.4.11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
DEU.4.12	And the 
DEU.4.13	And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. 
DEU.4.14	And the 
DEU.4.15	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the 
DEU.4.16	lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
DEU.4.17	the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven, 
DEU.4.18	the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth: 
DEU.4.19	and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which the 
DEU.4.20	But the 
DEU.4.21	Furthermore the 
DEU.4.22	but I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. 
DEU.4.23	Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	For the 
DEU.4.25	When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of any thing, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of the 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	And the 
DEU.4.28	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
DEU.4.29	But if from thence ye shall seek the 
DEU.4.30	When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to the 
DEU.4.31	for the 
DEU.4.32	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been 
DEU.4.33	Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 
DEU.4.34	Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of 
DEU.4.35	Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the 
DEU.4.36	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
DEU.4.38	to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day. 
DEU.4.39	Know therefore this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the 
DEU.4.40	And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land, which the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan toward the sunrising; 
DEU.4.42	that the manslayer might flee thither, which slayeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 
DEU.4.43	, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. 
DEU.4.44	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 
DEU.4.45	these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgements, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt; 
DEU.4.46	beyond Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt: 
DEU.4.47	and they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan toward the sunrising; 
DEU.4.48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon), 
DEU.4.49	and all the Arabah beyond Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the judgements which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	The 
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	(I stood between the 
DEU.5.6	I am the 
DEU.5.7	Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 
DEU.5.8	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, 
DEU.5.9	thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the 
DEU.5.10	and shewing mercy unto thousands, of them that love me and keep my commandments. 
DEU.5.11	Thou shalt not take the name of the 
DEU.5.12	Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the 
DEU.5.13	Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the 
DEU.5.15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.5.16	Honour thy father and thy mother, as the 
DEU.5.17	Thou shalt do no murder. 
DEU.5.18	Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 
DEU.5.19	Neither shalt thou steal. 
DEU.5.20	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
DEU.5.21	Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's. 
DEU.5.22	These words the 
DEU.5.23	And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
DEU.5.24	and ye said, Behold, the 
DEU.5.25	Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
DEU.5.27	Go thou near, and hear all that the 
DEU.5.28	And the 
DEU.5.29	Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! 
DEU.5.30	Go say to them, Return ye to your tents. 
DEU.5.31	But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the judgements, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. 
DEU.5.32	Ye shall observe to do therefore as the 
DEU.5.33	Ye shall walk in all the way which the 
DEU.6.1	Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgements, which the 
DEU.6.2	that thou mightest fear the 
DEU.6.3	Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the 
DEU.6.4	Hear, O Israel: the 
DEU.6.5	and thou shalt love the 
DEU.6.6	And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart: 
DEU.6.7	and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
DEU.6.8	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. 
DEU.6.9	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates. 
DEU.6.10	And it shall be, when the 
DEU.6.11	and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full; 
DEU.6.12	then beware lest thou forget the 
DEU.6.13	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.6.14	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples which are round about you; 
DEU.6.15	for the 
DEU.6.16	Ye shall not tempt the 
DEU.6.17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the 
DEU.6.18	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the 
DEU.6.19	to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as the 
DEU.6.20	When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgements, which the 
DEU.6.21	then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the 
DEU.6.22	and the 
DEU.6.23	and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 
DEU.6.24	And the 
DEU.6.25	And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the 
DEU.7.1	When the 
DEU.7.2	and when the 
DEU.7.3	neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 
DEU.7.4	For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the 
DEU.7.5	But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire. 
DEU.7.6	For thou art an holy people unto the 
DEU.7.7	The 
DEU.7.8	but because the 
DEU.7.9	Know therefore that the 
DEU.7.10	and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. 
DEU.7.11	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the judgements, which I command thee this day, to do them.
DEU.7.12	And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these judgements, and keep, and do them, that the 
DEU.7.13	and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy kine and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. 
DEU.7.14	Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 
DEU.7.15	And the 
DEU.7.16	And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the 
DEU.7.17	If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? 
DEU.7.18	thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what the 
DEU.7.19	the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the 
DEU.7.20	Moreover the 
DEU.7.21	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the 
DEU.7.22	And the 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. 
DEU.7.25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the 
DEU.7.26	and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
DEU.8.1	All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.8.2	And thou shalt remember all the way which the 
DEU.8.3	And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the 
DEU.8.4	Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. 
DEU.8.5	And thou shalt consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the 
DEU.8.6	And thou shalt keep the commandments of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of oil olives and honey; 
DEU.8.9	a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
DEU.8.10	And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless the 
DEU.8.11	Beware lest thou forget the 
DEU.8.12	lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 
DEU.8.13	and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; 
DEU.8.14	then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the 
DEU.8.15	who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, 
DEU.8.16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end: 
DEU.8.17	and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. 
DEU.8.18	But thou shalt remember the 
DEU.8.19	And it shall be, if thou shalt forget the 
DEU.8.20	As the nations which the 
DEU.9.1	Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven, 
DEU.9.2	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak? 
DEU.9.3	Know therefore this day, that the 
DEU.9.4	Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the 
DEU.9.5	Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go in to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the 
DEU.9.6	Know therefore, that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst the 
DEU.9.8	Also in Horeb ye provoked the 
DEU.9.9	When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the 
DEU.9.10	And the 
DEU.9.11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the 
DEU.9.12	And the 
DEU.9.13	Furthermore the 
DEU.9.14	let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. 
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
DEU.9.16	And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 
DEU.9.18	And I fell down before the 
DEU.9.19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the 
DEU.9.20	And the 
DEU.9.21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. 
DEU.9.22	And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the 
DEU.9.23	And when the 
DEU.9.24	Ye have been rebellious against the 
DEU.9.25	So I fell down before the 
DEU.9.26	And I prayed unto the 
DEU.9.27	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: 
DEU.9.28	lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the 
DEU.9.29	Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thy stretched out arm.
DEU.10.1	At that time the 
DEU.10.2	And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
DEU.10.3	So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. 
DEU.10.4	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the 
DEU.10.5	And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the 
DEU.10.6	(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. 
DEU.10.7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the 
DEU.10.10	And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and the 
DEU.10.11	And the 
DEU.10.12	And now, Israel, what doth the 
DEU.10.13	to keep the commandments of the 
DEU.10.14	Behold, unto the 
DEU.10.15	Only the 
DEU.10.16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 
DEU.10.17	For the 
DEU.10.18	He doth execute the judgement of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 
DEU.10.19	Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.10.21	He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. 
DEU.10.22	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the 
DEU.11.1	Therefore thou shalt love the 
DEU.11.2	And know ye this day: for 
DEU.11.3	and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 
DEU.11.4	and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the 
DEU.11.5	and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place; 
DEU.11.6	and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: 
DEU.11.7	but your eyes have seen all the great work of the 
DEU.11.8	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it; 
DEU.11.9	and that ye may prolong your days upon the land, which the 
DEU.11.10	For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 
DEU.11.11	but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, 
DEU.11.12	a land which the 
DEU.11.13	And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the 
DEU.11.14	that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
DEU.11.15	And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full. 
DEU.11.16	Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
DEU.11.17	and the anger of the 
DEU.11.18	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 
DEU.11.19	And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
DEU.11.20	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: 
DEU.11.21	that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the 
DEU.11.22	For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it; to love the 
DEU.11.23	then will the 
DEU.11.24	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border. 
DEU.11.25	There shall no man be able to stand before you: the 
DEU.11.26	Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 
DEU.11.27	the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the 
DEU.11.28	and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of the 
DEU.11.29	And it shall come to pass, when the 
DEU.11.30	Are they not beyond Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 
DEU.11.31	For ye are to pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the 
DEU.11.32	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the judgements which I set before you this day.
DEU.12.1	These are the statutes and the judgements, which ye shall observe to do in the land which the 
DEU.12.2	Ye shall surely destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: 
DEU.12.3	and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place. 
DEU.12.4	Ye shall not do so unto the 
DEU.12.5	But unto the place which the 
DEU.12.6	and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock: 
DEU.12.7	and there ye shall eat before the 
DEU.12.8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes: 
DEU.12.9	for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the 
DEU.12.10	But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the 
DEU.12.11	then it shall come to pass that the place which the 
DEU.12.12	and ye shall rejoice before the 
DEU.12.13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: 
DEU.12.14	but in the place which the 
DEU.12.15	Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.12.16	Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. 
DEU.12.17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, nor the heave offering of thine hand: 
DEU.12.18	but thou shalt eat them before the 
DEU.12.19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon thy land. 
DEU.12.20	When the 
DEU.12.21	If the place which the 
DEU.12.22	Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean shall eat thereof alike. 
DEU.12.23	Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh. 
DEU.12.24	Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. 
DEU.12.25	Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the 
DEU.12.26	Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the 
DEU.12.27	and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the 
DEU.12.28	Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of the 
DEU.12.29	When the 
DEU.12.30	take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. 
DEU.12.31	Thou shalt not do so unto the 
DEU.12.32	What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
DEU.13.1	If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder, 
DEU.13.2	and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 
DEU.13.3	thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for the 
DEU.13.4	Ye shall walk after the 
DEU.13.5	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken rebellion against the 
DEU.13.6	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 
DEU.13.7	of the gods of the peoples which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 
DEU.13.8	thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 
DEU.13.9	but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
DEU.13.10	And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to draw thee away from the 
DEU.13.11	And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.
DEU.13.12	If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which the 
DEU.13.13	Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; 
DEU.13.14	then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee; 
DEU.13.15	thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 
DEU.13.16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto the 
DEU.13.17	And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thine hand: that the 
DEU.13.18	when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the 
DEU.14.1	Ye are the children of the 
DEU.14.2	For thou art an holy people unto the 
DEU.14.3	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
DEU.14.4	These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 
DEU.14.5	the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois. 
DEU.14.6	And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof cloven in two, 
DEU.14.7	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney, because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you: 
DEU.14.8	and the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you: of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcases ye shall not touch. 
DEU.14.9	These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales shall ye eat: 
DEU.14.10	and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you. 
DEU.14.11	Of all clean birds ye may eat. 
DEU.14.12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the gier eagle, and the ospray; 
DEU.14.13	and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind; 
DEU.14.14	and every raven after its kind; 
DEU.14.15	and the ostrich, and the night hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind; 
DEU.14.16	the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl; 
DEU.14.17	and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant; 
DEU.14.18	and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 
DEU.14.19	And all winged creeping things are unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten. 
DEU.14.20	Of all clean fowls ye may eat. 
DEU.14.21	Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou mayest give it unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner: for thou art an holy people unto the 
DEU.14.22	Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which cometh forth of the field year by year. 
DEU.14.23	And thou shalt eat before the 
DEU.14.24	And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which the 
DEU.14.25	then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the 
DEU.14.26	and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee: and thou shalt eat there before the 
DEU.14.27	and the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee. 
DEU.14.28	At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates: 
DEU.14.29	and the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the 
DEU.15.1	At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. 
DEU.15.2	And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbour; he shall not exact it of his neighbour and his brother; because the 
DEU.15.3	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thine hand shall release. 
DEU.15.4	Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for the 
DEU.15.5	if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.15.6	For the 
DEU.15.7	If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which the 
DEU.15.8	but thou shalt surely open thine hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need 
DEU.15.9	Beware that there be not a base thought in thine heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto the 
DEU.15.10	Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the 
DEU.15.11	For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thine hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land.
DEU.15.12	If thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. 
DEU.15.13	And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty: 
DEU.15.14	thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress: as the 
DEU.15.15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.15.16	And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 
DEU.15.17	then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise. 
DEU.15.18	It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of an hireling hath he served thee six years: and the 
DEU.15.19	All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the 
DEU.15.20	Thou shalt eat it before the 
DEU.15.21	And if it have any blemish, 
DEU.15.22	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean 
DEU.15.23	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.
DEU.16.1	Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the 
DEU.16.2	And thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto the 
DEU.16.3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. 
DEU.16.4	And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. 
DEU.16.5	Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the 
DEU.16.6	but at the place which the 
DEU.16.7	And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the 
DEU.16.8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the 
DEU.16.9	Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing corn shalt thou begin to number seven weeks. 
DEU.16.10	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the 
DEU.16.11	and thou shalt rejoice before the 
DEU.16.12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. 
DEU.16.13	Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress: 
DEU.16.14	and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates. 
DEU.16.15	Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto the 
DEU.16.16	Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the 
DEU.16.17	every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.16.18	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the 
DEU.16.19	Thou shalt not wrest judgement; thou shalt not respect persons: neither shalt thou take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 
DEU.16.20	That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the 
DEU.16.21	Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the 
DEU.16.22	Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar; which the 
DEU.17.1	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the 
DEU.17.2	If there be found in the midst of thee, within any of thy gates which the 
DEU.17.3	and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; 
DEU.17.4	and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, then shalt thou inquire diligently, and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel; 
DEU.17.5	then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them with stones, that they die. 
DEU.17.6	At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. 
DEU.17.7	The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
DEU.17.8	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgement, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which the 
DEU.17.9	and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days: and thou shalt inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgement: 
DEU.17.10	and thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall shew thee from that place which the 
DEU.17.11	according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgement which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
DEU.17.12	And the man that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the 
DEU.17.13	And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
DEU.17.14	When thou art come unto the land which the 
DEU.17.15	thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the 
DEU.17.16	Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the 
DEU.17.17	Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 
DEU.17.18	And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of 
DEU.17.19	and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the 
DEU.17.20	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
DEU.18.1	The priests the Levites, 
DEU.18.2	And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: the 
DEU.18.3	And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 
DEU.18.4	The firstfruits of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him. 
DEU.18.5	For the 
DEU.18.6	And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which the 
DEU.18.7	then he shall minister in the name of the 
DEU.18.8	They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
DEU.18.9	When thou art come into the land which the 
DEU.18.10	There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, 
DEU.18.11	or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
DEU.18.12	For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the 
DEU.18.13	Thou shalt be perfect with the 
DEU.18.14	For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the 
DEU.18.15	The 
DEU.18.16	according to all that thou desiredst of the 
DEU.18.17	And the 
DEU.18.18	I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. 
DEU.18.19	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. 
DEU.18.20	But the prophet, which shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die. 
DEU.18.21	And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the 
DEU.18.22	when a prophet speaketh in the name of the 
DEU.19.1	When the 
DEU.19.2	thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.3	Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.4	And this is the case of the manslayer, which shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; 
DEU.19.5	as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live: 
DEU.19.6	lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. 
DEU.19.7	Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. 
DEU.19.8	And if the 
DEU.19.9	if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love the 
DEU.19.10	that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.11	But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die; and he flee into one of these cities: 
DEU.19.12	then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
DEU.19.13	Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
DEU.19.14	Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that the 
DEU.19.15	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. 
DEU.19.16	If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing; 
DEU.19.17	then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the 
DEU.19.18	and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; 
DEU.19.19	then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. 
DEU.19.20	And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee. 
DEU.19.21	And thine eye shall not pity; life 
DEU.20.1	When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, 
DEU.20.2	And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, 
DEU.20.3	and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them; 
DEU.20.4	for the 
DEU.20.5	And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
DEU.20.6	And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof. 
DEU.20.7	And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. 
DEU.20.8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart melt as his heart. 
DEU.20.9	And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people.
DEU.20.10	When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. 
DEU.20.11	And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee. 
DEU.20.12	And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 
DEU.20.13	and when the 
DEU.20.14	but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the 
DEU.20.15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
DEU.20.16	But of the cities of these peoples, which the 
DEU.20.17	but thou shalt utterly destroy them; the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as the 
DEU.20.18	that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the 
DEU.20.19	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee? 
DEU.20.20	Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.
DEU.21.1	If one be found slain in the land which the 
DEU.21.2	then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 
DEU.21.3	and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
DEU.21.4	and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley: 
DEU.21.5	and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the 
DEU.21.6	and all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley: 
DEU.21.7	and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 
DEU.21.8	Forgive, O 
DEU.21.9	So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the 
DEU.21.10	When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the 
DEU.21.11	and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; 
DEU.21.12	then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
DEU.21.13	and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. 
DEU.21.14	And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.
DEU.21.15	If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated; 
DEU.21.16	then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, which is the firstborn: 
DEU.21.17	but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
DEU.21.18	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them: 
DEU.21.19	then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
DEU.21.20	and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a riotous liver, and a drunkard. 
DEU.21.21	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. 
DEU.21.22	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; 
DEU.21.23	his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which the 
DEU.22.1	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother. 
DEU.22.2	And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thine house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again. 
DEU.22.3	And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself. 
DEU.22.4	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
DEU.22.5	A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the 
DEU.22.6	If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: 
DEU.22.7	thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. 
DEU.22.8	When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence. 
DEU.22.9	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed: lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard. 
DEU.22.10	Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. 
DEU.22.11	Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together. 
DEU.22.12	Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.
DEU.22.13	If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 
DEU.22.14	and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity: 
DEU.22.15	then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: 
DEU.22.16	and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 
DEU.22.17	and, lo, he hath laid shameful things 
DEU.22.18	And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him; 
DEU.22.19	and they shall amerce him in an hundred 
DEU.22.20	But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel: 
DEU.22.21	then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father's house: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. 
DEU.22.22	If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel. 
DEU.22.23	If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 
DEU.22.24	then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. 
DEU.22.25	But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die: 
DEU.22.26	but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: 
DEU.22.27	for he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. 
DEU.22.28	If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 
DEU.22.29	then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty 
DEU.22.30	A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt.
DEU.23.1	He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of the 
DEU.23.2	A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of the 
DEU.23.3	An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the 
DEU.23.4	because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee. 
DEU.23.5	Nevertheless the 
DEU.23.6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. 
DEU.23.7	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. 
DEU.23.8	The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of the 
DEU.23.9	When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing. 
DEU.23.10	If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: 
DEU.23.11	but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water: and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp. 
DEU.23.12	Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: 
DEU.23.13	and thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: 
DEU.23.14	for the 
DEU.23.15	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant which is escaped from his master unto thee: 
DEU.23.16	he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him. 
DEU.23.17	There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 
DEU.23.18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the wages of a dog, into the house of the 
DEU.23.19	Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: 
DEU.23.20	unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the 
DEU.23.21	When thou shalt vow a vow unto the 
DEU.23.22	But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 
DEU.23.23	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed unto the 
DEU.23.24	When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel. 
DEU.23.25	When thou comest into thy neighbour's standing corn, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.
DEU.24.1	When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it shall be, if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
DEU.24.2	And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's 
DEU.24.3	And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; 
DEU.24.4	her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the 
DEU.24.5	When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife which he hath taken. 
DEU.24.6	No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh 
DEU.24.7	If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. 
DEU.24.8	Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. 
DEU.24.9	Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. 
DEU.24.11	Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee. 
DEU.24.12	And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge: 
DEU.24.13	thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the 
DEU.24.14	Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates: 
DEU.24.15	in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the 
DEU.24.16	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 
DEU.24.17	Thou shalt not wrest the judgement of the stranger, 
DEU.24.18	but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the 
DEU.24.19	When thou reapest thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the 
DEU.24.20	When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
DEU.24.21	When thou gatherest 
DEU.24.22	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
DEU.25.1	If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgement, and 
DEU.25.2	and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number. 
DEU.25.3	Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee. 
DEU.25.4	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out 
DEU.25.5	If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her. 
DEU.25.6	And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not blotted out of Israel. 
DEU.25.7	And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of an husband's brother unto me. 
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand, and say, I like not to take her; 
DEU.25.9	then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto the man that doth not build up his brother's house. 
DEU.25.10	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. 
DEU.25.11	When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: 
DEU.25.12	then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity.
DEU.25.13	Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. 
DEU.25.14	Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. 
DEU.25.15	A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be long upon the land which the 
DEU.25.16	For all that do such things; 
DEU.25.17	Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt; 
DEU.25.18	how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. 
DEU.25.19	Therefore it shall be, when the 
DEU.26.1	And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the 
DEU.26.2	that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that the 
DEU.26.3	And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the 
DEU.26.4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the 
DEU.26.5	And thou shalt answer and say before the 
DEU.26.6	and the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 
DEU.26.7	and we cried unto the 
DEU.26.8	and the 
DEU.26.9	and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
DEU.26.10	And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O 
DEU.26.11	and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which the 
DEU.26.12	When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; 
DEU.26.13	and thou shalt say before the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of the 
DEU.26.15	Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the ground which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
DEU.26.16	This day the 
DEU.26.17	Thou hast avouched the 
DEU.26.18	and the 
DEU.26.19	and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the 
DEU.27.1	And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day. 
DEU.27.2	And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the 
DEU.27.3	and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which the 
DEU.27.4	And it shall be when ye are passed over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister. 
DEU.27.5	And there shalt thou build an altar unto the 
DEU.27.6	Thou shalt build the altar of the 
DEU.27.7	and thou shalt sacrifice peace offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before the 
DEU.27.8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. 
DEU.27.9	And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Keep silence, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the 
DEU.27.11	And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 
DEU.27.12	These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are passed over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin: 
DEU.27.13	and these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
DEU.27.14	And the Levites shall answer, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice, 
DEU.27.15	Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto the 
DEU.27.16	Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.17	Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.18	Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.19	Cursed be he that wresteth the judgement of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.20	Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he hath uncovered his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.21	Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.22	Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.23	Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.24	Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour in secret. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.25	Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
DEU.27.26	Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.28.1	And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.2	and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.3	Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. 
DEU.28.4	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the young of thy flock. 
DEU.28.5	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneadingtrough. 
DEU.28.6	Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 
DEU.28.7	The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	And all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the 
DEU.28.11	And the 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	And the 
DEU.28.14	and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
DEU.28.15	But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.16	Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. 
DEU.28.17	Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneadingtrough. 
DEU.28.18	Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the increase of thy kine, and the young of thy flock. 
DEU.28.19	Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 
DEU.28.20	The 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. 
DEU.28.24	The 
DEU.28.25	The 
DEU.28.26	And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and there shall be none to fray them away. 
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled alway, and there shall be none to save thee. 
DEU.28.30	Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof. 
DEU.28.31	Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to save thee. 
DEU.28.32	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nought in the power of thine hand. 
DEU.28.33	The fruit of thy ground, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway: 
DEU.28.34	so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither the 
DEU.28.38	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust shall consume it. 
DEU.28.39	Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather 
DEU.28.40	Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil: for thine olive shall cast 
DEU.28.41	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity. 
DEU.28.42	All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess. 
DEU.28.43	The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and lower. 
DEU.28.44	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
DEU.28.45	And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.46	and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever: 
DEU.28.47	because thou servedst not the 
DEU.28.48	therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the 
DEU.28.49	The 
DEU.28.50	a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: 
DEU.28.51	and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee corn, wine, or oil, the increase of thy kine, or the young of thy flock, until he have caused thee to perish. 
DEU.28.52	And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the 
DEU.28.53	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the 
DEU.28.54	The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he hath remaining: 
DEU.28.55	so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in all thy gates. 
DEU.28.56	The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter; 
DEU.28.57	and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly: in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in thy gates. 
DEU.28.58	If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE 
DEU.28.59	then the 
DEU.28.60	And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 
DEU.28.61	Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the 
DEU.28.62	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.63	And it shall come to pass, that as the 
DEU.28.64	And the 
DEU.28.65	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but the 
DEU.28.66	and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 
DEU.28.67	in the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 
DEU.28.68	And the 
DEU.29.1	These are the words of the covenant which the 
DEU.29.2	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the 
DEU.29.3	the great temptations which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders: 
DEU.29.4	but the 
DEU.29.5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. 
DEU.29.6	Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: 
DEU.29.8	and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Manassites. 
DEU.29.9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
DEU.29.10	Ye stand this day all of you before the 
DEU.29.11	your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water: 
DEU.29.12	that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the 
DEU.29.13	that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
DEU.29.14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 
DEU.29.15	but with him that standeth here with us this day before the 
DEU.29.16	(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed; 
DEU.29.17	and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:) 
DEU.29.18	lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the 
DEU.29.19	and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of mine heart, to destroy the moist with the dry: 
DEU.29.20	the 
DEU.29.21	And the 
DEU.29.22	And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith the 
DEU.29.23	 the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, 
DEU.29.24	even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath the 
DEU.29.25	Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them: 
DEU.29.27	therefore the anger of the 
DEU.29.28	and the 
DEU.29.29	The secret things belong unto the 
DEU.30.1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the 
DEU.30.2	and shalt return unto the 
DEU.30.3	that then the 
DEU.30.4	If 
DEU.30.5	and the 
DEU.30.6	And the 
DEU.30.7	And the 
DEU.30.8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the 
DEU.30.9	And the 
DEU.30.10	if thou shalt obey the voice of the 
DEU.30.11	For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. 
DEU.30.12	It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? 
DEU.30.13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? 
DEU.30.14	But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
DEU.30.15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; 
DEU.30.16	in that I command thee this day to love the 
DEU.30.17	But if thine heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
DEU.30.18	I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go in to possess it. 
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed: 
DEU.30.20	to love the 
DEU.31.1	And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
DEU.31.2	And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and the 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	And the 
DEU.31.5	And the 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for the 
DEU.31.7	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which the 
DEU.31.8	And the 
DEU.31.9	And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of 
DEU.31.11	when all Israel is come to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the 
DEU.31.13	and that their children, which have not known, may hear, and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	And the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? 
DEU.31.18	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. 
DEU.31.19	Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
DEU.31.20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
DEU.31.21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. 
DEU.31.23	And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee. 
DEU.31.24	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
DEU.31.25	that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.26	Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the 
DEU.31.28	Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of the 
DEU.31.30	And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
DEU.32.1	Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth: 
DEU.32.2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, My speech shall distil as the dew; As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb: 
DEU.32.3	For I will proclaim the name of the 
DEU.32.4	The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are judgement: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he. 
DEU.32.5	They have dealt corruptly with him, 
DEU.32.6	Do ye thus requite the 
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee. 
DEU.32.8	When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel. 
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye: 
DEU.32.11	As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions: 
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock; 
DEU.32.14	Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the fat of kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.
DEU.32.15	But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek: Then he forsook God which made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
DEU.32.16	They moved him to jealousy with strange 
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed unto demons, 
DEU.32.18	Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.
DEU.32.19	And the 
DEU.32.20	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very froward generation, Children in whom is no faith. 
DEU.32.21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest pit, And devoureth the earth with her increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
DEU.32.23	I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them: 
DEU.32.24	 wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust. 
DEU.32.25	Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; 
DEU.32.26	I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: 
DEU.32.27	Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misdeem, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And the 
DEU.32.28	For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them. 
DEU.32.29	Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end! 
DEU.32.30	How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges. 
DEU.32.32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter: 
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the poison of dragons, And the cruel venom of asps. 
DEU.32.34	Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures? 
DEU.32.35	Vengeance is mine, and recompence, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste. 
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.37	And he shall say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they trusted; 
DEU.32.38	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, 
DEU.32.39	See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I have wounded, and I heal: And there is none that can deliver out of my hand. 
DEU.32.40	For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever, 
DEU.32.41	If I whet my glittering sword, And mine hand take hold on judgement; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me. 
DEU.32.42	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy. 
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, O ye nations, 
DEU.32.44	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 
DEU.32.45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: 
DEU.32.46	And he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day; which ye shall command your children, to observe to do all the words of this law. 
DEU.32.47	For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. 
DEU.32.48	And the 
DEU.32.49	Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: 
DEU.32.50	and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: 
DEU.32.51	because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. 
DEU.32.52	For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.
DEU.33.1	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
DEU.33.2	And he said, The 
DEU.33.3	Yea, he loveth the peoples; All his saints are in thy hand: And they sat down at thy feet; 
DEU.33.4	Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. 
DEU.33.5	And he was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.
DEU.33.6	Let Reuben live, and not die; Yet let his men be few. 
DEU.33.7	And this is 
DEU.33.8	And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; 
DEU.33.9	Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant. 
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Jacob thy judgements, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt offering upon thine altar. 
DEU.33.11	Bless, 
DEU.33.12	Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the 
DEU.33.13	And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the 
DEU.33.14	And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons, 
DEU.33.15	And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills, 
DEU.33.16	And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: Let 
DEU.33.17	The firstling of his bullock, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them, 
DEU.33.18	And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And, Issachar, in thy tents. 
DEU.33.19	They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand. 
DEU.33.20	And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head. 
DEU.33.21	And he provided the first part for himself, For there was the lawgiver's portion reserved; And he came 
DEU.33.22	And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan. 
DEU.33.23	And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, And full with the blessing of the 
DEU.33.24	And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable unto his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil. 
DEU.33.25	Thy bars shall be iron and brass; And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
DEU.33.26	There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heaven for thy help, And in his excellency on the skies. 
DEU.33.27	The eternal God is 
DEU.33.28	And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of corn and wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew. 
DEU.33.29	Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, a people saved by the 
DEU.34.1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the 
DEU.34.2	and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea; 
DEU.34.3	and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	And the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 
DEU.34.7	And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 
DEU.34.8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.
DEU.34.9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the 
DEU.34.10	And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	in all the signs and the wonders, which the 
DEU.34.12	and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. 
JOS.1.3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border. 
JOS.1.5	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee nor forsake thee. 
JOS.1.6	Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest. 
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. 
JOS.1.9	Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
JOS.1.11	Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the 
JOS.1.12	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 
JOS.1.13	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them; 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the 
JOS.1.18	Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
JOS.2.1	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go view the land, and Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of an harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there. 
JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land. 
JOS.2.3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the land. 
JOS.2.4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 
JOS.2.5	and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. 
JOS.2.7	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
JOS.2.8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; 
JOS.2.9	and she said unto the men, I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for the 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the 
JOS.2.13	and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death. 
JOS.2.14	And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. 
JOS.2.16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 
JOS.2.17	And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
JOS.2.18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household. 
JOS.2.19	And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. 
JOS.2.20	But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
JOS.2.21	And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
JOS.2.22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. 
JOS.2.24	And they said unto Joshua, Truly the 
JOS.3.1	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over. 
JOS.3.2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp; 
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore. 
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. 
JOS.3.9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite. 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. 
JOS.3.12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man. 
JOS.3.13	And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people; 
JOS.3.15	and when they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,) 
JOS.3.16	that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan: and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over Jordan, that the 
JOS.4.2	Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 
JOS.4.3	and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night. 
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
JOS.4.5	and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? 
JOS.4.7	then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the 
JOS.4.9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there, unto this day.
JOS.4.10	For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the 
JOS.4.11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them: 
JOS.4.13	about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	And the 
JOS.4.16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. 
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. 
JOS.4.18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
JOS.4.20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? 
JOS.4.22	Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard how that the 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
JOS.5.4	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	For all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war which came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the 
JOS.5.7	And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 
JOS.5.8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. 
JOS.5.9	And the 
JOS.5.10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 
JOS.5.11	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day. 
JOS.5.12	And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
JOS.5.14	And he said, Nay; but 
JOS.5.15	And the captain of the 
JOS.6.1	(Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.) 
JOS.6.2	And the 
JOS.6.3	And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.
JOS.6.6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the 
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, 
JOS.6.10	And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout. 
JOS.6.11	So he caused the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. 
JOS.6.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the 
JOS.6.17	And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to the 
JOS.6.18	And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so should ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it. 
JOS.6.19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto the 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted, and 
JOS.6.21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.6.22	And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. 
JOS.6.23	And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the 
JOS.6.25	But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
JOS.6.26	And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of the 
JOS.7.2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few. 
JOS.7.4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: and they chased them 
JOS.7.6	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord 
JOS.7.8	Oh Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies! 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?
JOS.7.10	And the 
JOS.7.11	Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff. 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you. 
JOS.7.13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the 
JOS.7.15	And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 
JOS.7.17	and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: 
JOS.7.18	and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 
JOS.7.19	And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the 
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, beheld, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. 
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 
JOS.7.23	And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before the 
JOS.7.24	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the 
JOS.7.26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and the 
JOS.8.1	And the 
JOS.8.2	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night. 
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready: 
JOS.8.5	and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them; 
JOS.8.6	and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first; so we will flee before them: 
JOS.8.7	and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for the 
JOS.8.8	And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the 
JOS.8.9	And Joshua sent them forth: and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
JOS.8.10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	And all the people, 
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the vale. 
JOS.8.14	And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he wist not that there was an ambush against him behind the city. 
JOS.8.15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
JOS.8.18	And the 
JOS.8.19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
JOS.8.23	And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
JOS.8.24	And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua drew not back his hand wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day. 
JOS.8.29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar unto the 
JOS.8.31	as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel. 
JOS.8.33	And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.8.34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
JOS.9.1	And it came to pass when all the kings which were beyond Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof; 
JOS.9.2	that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
JOS.9.3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, old and rent and bound up; 
JOS.9.5	and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy. 
JOS.9.6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us. 
JOS.9.7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you? 
JOS.9.8	And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? 
JOS.9.9	And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the 
JOS.9.10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us. 
JOS.9.12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy: 
JOS.9.13	and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. 
JOS.9.14	And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the 
JOS.9.15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. 
JOS.9.16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. 
JOS.9.17	And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
JOS.9.18	And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 
JOS.9.21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had spoken unto them.
JOS.9.22	And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us? 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
JOS.9.24	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the 
JOS.9.25	And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do. 
JOS.9.26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 
JOS.9.27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; 
JOS.10.2	that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty. 
JOS.10.3	Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
JOS.10.5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it. 
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us.
JOS.10.7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. 
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; 
JOS.10.10	And the 
JOS.10.11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were in the going down of Beth-horon, that the 
JOS.10.12	Then spake Joshua to the 
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. 
JOS.10.14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the 
JOS.10.15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 
JOS.10.16	And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.18	And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them: 
JOS.10.19	but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the 
JOS.10.20	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fenced cities, 
JOS.10.21	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 
JOS.10.22	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave. 
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. 
JOS.10.25	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. 
JOS.10.27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.
JOS.10.28	And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof; he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein, he left none remaining: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho. 
JOS.10.29	And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 
JOS.10.30	and the 
JOS.10.31	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 
JOS.10.32	and the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. 
JOS.10.34	And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it; 
JOS.10.35	and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. 
JOS.10.36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: 
JOS.10.37	and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein. 
JOS.10.38	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it: 
JOS.10.39	and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof. 
JOS.10.40	So Joshua smote all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining: but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the 
JOS.10.41	And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the 
JOS.10.43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west, 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 
JOS.11.5	And all these kings met together; and they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel. 
JOS.11.6	And the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them. 
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	And Joshua did unto them as the 
JOS.11.10	And Jeshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire. 
JOS.11.12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.11.13	But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. 
JOS.11.14	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same; 
JOS.11.17	from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle. 
JOS.11.20	For it was of the 
JOS.11.21	And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the 
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward: 
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and 
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah: 
JOS.12.4	and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
JOS.12.5	and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
JOS.12.6	Moses the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; 
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one; 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and the 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, 
JOS.13.4	on the south: all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Zidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites: 
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath: 
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Zidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
JOS.13.7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.13.8	With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;

JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drave them out. 
JOS.13.13	Nevertheless the children of Israel drave not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day. 
JOS.13.14	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the offerings of the 
JOS.13.15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families. 
JOS.13.16	And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;

JOS.13.22	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain. 
JOS.13.23	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border 
JOS.13.24	And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families. 
JOS.13.25	And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof. 
JOS.13.29	And Moses gave 
JOS.13.30	And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities: 
JOS.13.31	and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families. 
JOS.13.32	These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward. 
JOS.13.33	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave none inheritance: the 
JOS.14.1	And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' 
JOS.14.2	by the lot of their inheritance, as the 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe beyond Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance. 
JOS.14.5	As the 
JOS.14.6	Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the 
JOS.14.7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the 
JOS.14.8	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the 
JOS.14.9	And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the 
JOS.14.10	And now, behold, the 
JOS.14.11	As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war and to go out and to come in. 
JOS.14.12	Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the 
JOS.14.13	And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, unto this day; because that he wholly followed the 
JOS.14.15	Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kirjath-arba; 
JOS.15.1	And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south. 
JOS.15.2	And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looked southward:

JOS.15.8	and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem): and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward:

JOS.15.12	And the west border was to the great sea, and the border 
JOS.15.13	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.15.14	And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. 
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
JOS.15.17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
JOS.15.18	And it came to pass, when she came 
JOS.15.19	And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.

JOS.17.7	And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:

JOS.17.14	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto the 
JOS.17.15	And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee. 
JOS.17.16	And the children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and her towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel. 
JOS.17.17	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only: 
JOS.17.18	but the hill country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they be strong.
JOS.18.1	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.
JOS.18.2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.

JOS.18.4	Appoint for you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me. 
JOS.18.5	And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north. 
JOS.18.6	And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring

JOS.19.43	and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron; 
JOS.19.44	and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath; 
JOS.19.45	and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon; 
JOS.19.46	and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa. 
JOS.19.47	And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them: for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 
JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.49	So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua me son of Nun in the midst of them: 
JOS.19.50	according to the commandment of the 
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' 
JOS.20.1	And the 
JOS.20.2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 
JOS.20.3	that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly 
JOS.20.4	And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 
JOS.20.5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unawares, and hated him not beforetime. 
JOS.20.6	And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgement, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
JOS.20.7	And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
JOS.21.1	Then came near the heads of fathers' 
JOS.21.2	and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The 
JOS.21.3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.21.4	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities. 
JOS.21.5	And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. 
JOS.21.6	And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities. 
JOS.21.7	The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. 
JOS.21.8	And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the 
JOS.21.9	And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are 
JOS.21.10	and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi: for theirs was the first lot. 
JOS.21.11	And they gave them Kiriath-arba, 
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession. 
JOS.21.13	And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with her suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.14	and Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.15	and Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.16	and Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.17	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.19	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs. 
JOS.21.20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.21.21	And they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in the hill country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.22	and Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.23	And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.25	And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with her suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; two cities. 
JOS.21.26	All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs. 
JOS.21.27	And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half tribe of Manasseh 
JOS.21.28	And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with her suburbs, Daberath with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannin with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.30	And out of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.32	And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities. 
JOS.21.33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs. 
JOS.21.34	And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.36	And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahaz with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.38	And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with her suburbs; 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all. 
JOS.21.40	All 
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. 
JOS.21.42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	And the 
JOS.21.45	There failed not aught of any good thing which the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the 
JOS.22.4	And now the 
JOS.22.5	Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents. 
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given 
JOS.22.8	and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 
JOS.22.9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.22.10	And when they came unto the region about Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to. 
JOS.22.11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel. 
JOS.22.12	And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war. 
JOS.22.13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest; 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel. 
JOS.22.15	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, 
JOS.22.16	Thus saith the whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of the 
JOS.22.18	that ye must turn away this day from following the 
JOS.22.19	Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the 
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, 
JOS.22.22	The 
JOS.22.23	that we have built us an altar to turn away from following the 
JOS.22.24	and if we have not 
JOS.22.25	for the 
JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, Let as now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 
JOS.22.27	but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of the 
JOS.22.28	Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the 
JOS.22.29	God forbid that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well. 
JOS.22.31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that the 
JOS.22.32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. 
JOS.22.33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt. 
JOS.22.34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar 
JOS.23.1	And it came to pass after many days, when the 
JOS.23.2	that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years: 
JOS.23.3	and ye have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun. 
JOS.23.5	And the 
JOS.23.6	Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; 
JOS.23.7	that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear 
JOS.23.8	but cleave unto the 
JOS.23.9	For the 
JOS.23.10	One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the 
JOS.23.11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the 
JOS.23.12	Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 
JOS.23.13	know for a certainty that the 
JOS.23.14	And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the 
JOS.23.15	And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which the 
JOS.23.16	When ye transgress the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the 
JOS.24.3	And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 
JOS.24.4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea. 
JOS.24.7	And when they cried out unto the 
JOS.24.8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: 
JOS.24.10	but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. 
JOS.24.11	And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand. 
JOS.24.12	And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 
JOS.24.13	And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not laboured, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. 
JOS.24.14	Now therefore fear the 
JOS.24.15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the 
JOS.24.16	And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	for the 
JOS.24.18	and the 
JOS.24.19	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the 
JOS.24.20	If ye forsake the 
JOS.24.21	And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the 
JOS.24.23	Now therefore put away, 
JOS.24.24	And the people said unto Joshua, The 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of the 
JOS.24.28	So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 
JOS.24.31	And Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. 
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked of the 
JDG.1.2	And the 
JDG.1.3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	And Judah went up; and the 
JDG.1.5	And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 
JDG.1.7	And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered 
JDG.1.8	And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
JDG.1.9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland. 
JDG.1.10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba:) and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 
JDG.1.11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.) 
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
JDG.1.13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
JDG.1.14	And it came to pass, when she came 
JDG.1.15	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. 
JDG.1.16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses' brother in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people. 
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof. 
JDG.1.19	And the 
JDG.1.20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drave out thence the three sons of Anak.
JDG.1.21	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem: but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem, unto this day. 
JDG.1.22	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the 
JDG.1.23	And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.) 
JDG.1.24	And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee. 
JDG.1.25	And he shewed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family. 
JDG.1.26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day. 
JDG.1.27	And Manasseh did not drive out 
JDG.1.28	And it came to pass, when Israel was waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out. 
JDG.1.29	And Ephraim drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. 
JDG.1.30	Zebulun drave not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributary. 
JDG.1.31	Asher drave not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 
JDG.1.32	but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out. 
JDG.1.33	Naphtali drave not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary unto them. 
JDG.1.34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 
JDG.1.35	but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributary. 
JDG.1.36	And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
JDG.2.1	And the angel of the 
JDG.2.2	and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this? 
JDG.2.3	Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be 
JDG.2.4	And it came to pass, when the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the 
JDG.2.6	Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 
JDG.2.7	And the people served the 
JDG.2.8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the 
JDG.2.11	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.2.12	and they forsook the 
JDG.2.13	And they forsook the 
JDG.2.14	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.15	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	And the 
JDG.2.17	And yet they hearkened not unto their judges, for they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of the 
JDG.2.18	And when the 
JDG.2.19	But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way. 
JDG.2.20	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.21	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: 
JDG.2.22	that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the 
JDG.2.23	So the 
JDG.3.1	Now these are the nations which the 
JDG.3.2	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof; 
JDG.3.3	, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	And they were for to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the 
JDG.3.5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites; the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
JDG.3.6	and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
JDG.3.7	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	And when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.10	And the spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees. 
JDG.3.14	And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 
JDG.3.15	But when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.16	And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
JDG.3.17	And he offered the present unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	And when he had made an end of offering the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. 
JDG.3.20	And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in his summer parlour. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. 
JDG.3.21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
JDG.3.22	and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and it came out behind. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 
JDG.3.24	Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked; and they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. 
JDG.3.25	And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took the key, and opened 
JDG.3.26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them. 
JDG.3.28	And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the 
JDG.3.29	And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valour; and there escaped not a man. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
JDG.3.31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also saved Israel.
JDG.4.1	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.4.2	And the 
JDG.4.3	And the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgement. 
JDG.4.6	Ands she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the 
JDG.4.7	And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. 
JDG.4.8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go. 
JDG.4.9	And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the 
JDG.4.10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. 
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother in law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh. 
JDG.4.12	And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon. 
JDG.4.14	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
JDG.4.17	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. 
JDG.4.19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. 
JDG.4.20	And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. 
JDG.4.21	Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. 
JDG.4.22	And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples. 
JDG.4.23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, 
JDG.5.2	For that the leaders took the lead in Israel, for that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye the 
JDG.5.3	Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, 
JDG.5.4	, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yea, the clouds dropped water. 
JDG.5.5	The mountains flowed down at the presence of the 
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways. 
JDG.5.7	The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel. 
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? 
JDG.5.9	My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people: bless ye the 
JDG.5.10	Tell 
JDG.5.11	Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the 
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. 
JDG.5.13	Then came down a remnant of the nobles 
JDG.5.14	Out of Ephraim 
JDG.5.15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak; into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben there were great resolves of heart. 
JDG.5.16	Why satest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. 
JDG.5.17	Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and abode by his creeks. 
JDG.5.18	Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, and Naphtali, upon the high places of the field. 
JDG.5.19	The kings came and fought; then fought the kings of Canaan; in Taanach by the waters of Meggido: they took no gain of money. 
JDG.5.20	They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. 
JDG.5.21	The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength. 
JDG.5.22	Then did the horsehoofs stamp by reason of the pransings, the pransings of their strong ones. 
JDG.5.23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the 
JDG.5.24	Blessed above women shall Jael be, the wife of Heber the Kenite, blessed shall she be above women in the tent. 
JDG.5.25	He asked water, 
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head, yea, she pierced and struck through his temples. 
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead. 
JDG.5.28	Through the window she looked forth, and cried, the mother of Sisera 
JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, 
JDG.5.30	Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? a damsel, two damsels to every man; to Sisera a spoil of divers colours, a spoil of divers colours of embroidery, of divers colours of embroidery on both sides, on the necks of the spoil? 
JDG.5.31	So let all thine enemies perish, 
JDG.6.1	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.6.2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strong holds. 
JDG.6.3	And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them; 
JDG.6.4	and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. 
JDG.6.5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it. 
JDG.6.6	And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.8	that the 
JDG.6.9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; 
JDG.6.10	and I said unto you, I am the 
JDG.6.11	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.12	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	And Gideon said unto him, Oh my lord, if the 
JDG.6.14	And the 
JDG.6.15	And he said unto him, Oh Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house. 
JDG.6.16	And the 
JDG.6.17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me. 
JDG.6.18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. 
JDG.6.19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. 
JDG.6.20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	And Gideon saw that he was the angel of the 
JDG.6.23	And the 
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the 
JDG.6.25	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.6.26	and build an altar unto the 
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the 
JDG.6.28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. 
JDG.6.29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it. 
JDG.6.31	And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel 
JDG.6.34	But the spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. 
JDG.6.36	And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken, 
JDG.6.37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken. 
JDG.6.38	And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 
JDG.6.39	And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. 
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 
JDG.7.2	And the 
JDG.7.3	Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. 
JDG.7.4	And the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and the 
JDG.7.6	And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	And the 
JDG.7.8	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
JDG.7.9	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.7.10	But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp: 
JDG.7.11	and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp. 
JDG.7.12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea shore for multitude. 
JDG.7.13	And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay along. 
JDG.7.14	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host. 
JDG.7.15	And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for the 
JDG.7.16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. 
JDG.7.17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. 
JDG.7.18	When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For the 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the 
JDG.7.21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put 
JDG.7.22	And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and the 
JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian. 
JDG.7.24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even Jordan. 
JDG.7.25	And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond Jordan.
JDG.8.1	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him sharply. 
JDG.8.2	And he said unto them, What have I now done in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
JDG.8.3	God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
JDG.8.4	And Gideon came to Jordan, 
JDG.8.5	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian. 
JDG.8.6	And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? 
JDG.8.7	And Gideon said: Therefore when the 
JDG.8.8	And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them in like manner: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. 
JDG.8.9	And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. 
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. 
JDG.8.11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure. 
JDG.8.12	And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. 
JDG.8.13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men. 
JDG.8.15	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? 
JDG.8.16	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. 
JDG.8.17	And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. 
JDG.8.19	And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as the 
JDG.8.20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. 
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian. 
JDG.8.23	And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the 
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
JDG.8.25	And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil. 
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred 
JDG.8.27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went a whoring after it there: and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. 
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
JDG.8.33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	And the children of Israel remembered not the 
JDG.8.35	neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, 
JDG.9.1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying, 
JDG.9.2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. 
JDG.9.3	And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother. 
JDG.9.4	And they gave him threescore and ten 
JDG.9.5	And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself. 
JDG.9.6	And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
JDG.9.7	And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. 
JDG.9.8	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? 
JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us. 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? 
JDG.9.12	And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us. 
JDG.9.13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? 
JDG.9.14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us. 
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. 
JDG.9.16	Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands; 
JDG.9.17	(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 
JDG.9.18	and ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;) 
JDG.9.19	if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you: 
JDG.9.20	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech. 
JDG.9.21	And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
JDG.9.22	And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. 
JDG.9.23	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 
JDG.9.24	that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, which strengthened his hands to slay his brethren. 
JDG.9.25	And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech. 
JDG.9.26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. 
JDG.9.27	And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trode 
JDG.9.28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him? 
JDG.9.29	And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out. 
JDG.9.30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city 
JDG.9.32	Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field: 
JDG.9.33	and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. 
JDG.9.34	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
JDG.9.35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment. 
JDG.9.36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. 
JDG.9.37	And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim. 
JDG.9.38	Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them. 
JDG.9.39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entering of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drave out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 
JDG.9.42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. 
JDG.9.43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. 
JDG.9.44	And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them. 
JDG.9.45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. 
JDG.9.46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the hold of the house of El-berith. 
JDG.9.47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
JDG.9.48	And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. 
JDG.9.49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and brake his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 
JDG.9.56	Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
JDG.9.57	and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
JDG.10.1	And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. 
JDG.10.3	And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years. 
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 
JDG.10.5	And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.10.7	And the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years 
JDG.10.9	And the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
JDG.10.10	And the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.10.11	And the 
JDG.10.12	The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand. 
JDG.10.13	Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress. 
JDG.10.15	And the children of Israel said unto the 
JDG.10.16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. 
JDG.11.2	And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drave out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of another woman. 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
JDG.11.4	And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 
JDG.11.6	and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon. 
JDG.11.7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress? 
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon, and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 
JDG.11.9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land? 
JDG.11.13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those 
JDG.11.14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon: 
JDG.11.15	and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: 
JDG.11.16	but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; 
JDG.11.17	then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh. 
JDG.11.18	Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for Arnon was the border of Moab. 
JDG.11.19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place. 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.21	And the 
JDG.11.22	And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	So now the 
JDG.11.24	Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the 
JDG.11.25	And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
JDG.11.26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time? 
JDG.11.27	I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the 
JDG.11.28	Howbeit the king of the children Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
JDG.11.29	Then the spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the 
JDG.11.31	then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the 
JDG.11.33	And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abel-cheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. 
JDG.11.34	And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
JDG.11.35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the 
JDG.11.36	And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto the 
JDG.11.37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions. 
JDG.11.38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 
JDG.11.39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she had not known man. And it was a custom in Israel, 
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
JDG.12.1	And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. 
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand. 
JDG.12.3	And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, 
JDG.12.5	And the Gileadites took the fords of Jordan against the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when 
JDG.12.6	then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of Jordan: and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand. 
JDG.12.7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in 
JDG.12.8	And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 
JDG.12.10	And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem. 
JDG.12.11	And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 
JDG.12.13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	And he had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not. 
JDG.13.3	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 
JDG.13.5	for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head: for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: 
JDG.13.7	but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah entreated the 
JDG.13.9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day. 
JDG.13.11	And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am. 
JDG.13.12	And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the manner of the child, and 
JDG.13.13	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
JDG.13.15	And Manoah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	And Manoah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the 
JDG.13.20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	But the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said unto him, If the 
JDG.13.24	And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the 
JDG.13.25	And the spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. 
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. 
JDG.14.4	But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the 
JDG.14.5	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. 
JDG.14.6	And the spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 
JDG.14.8	And after a while he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. 
JDG.14.9	And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went, and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
JDG.14.10	And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 
JDG.14.11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
JDG.14.12	And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment: 
JDG.14.13	but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. 
JDG.14.14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle. 
JDG.14.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not 
JDG.14.16	And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee? 
JDG.14.17	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 
JDG.14.18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 
JDG.14.19	And the spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	But Samson's wife was 
JDG.15.1	But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. 
JDG.15.2	And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. 
JDG.15.3	And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief. 
JDG.15.4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails. 
JDG.15.5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards. 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 
JDG.15.8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. 
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. 
JDG.15.12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. 
JDG.15.13	And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. 
JDG.15.14	When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith. 
JDG.15.16	And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men. 
JDG.15.17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
JDG.15.18	And he was sore athirst, and called on the 
JDG.15.19	But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day. 
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
JDG.16.1	And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her. 
JDG.16.2	 the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, 
JDG.16.3	And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
JDG.16.4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred 
JDG.16.6	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. 
JDG.16.7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man. 
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now she had liers in wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. 
JDG.16.10	And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 
JDG.16.11	And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man. 
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And the liers in wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread. 
JDG.16.13	And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
JDG.16.14	And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web. 
JDG.16.15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. 
JDG.16.16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death. 
JDG.16.17	And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
JDG.16.18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand. 
JDG.16.19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 
JDG.16.20	And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself. But he wist not that the 
JDG.16.21	And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
JDG.16.22	Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. 
JDG.16.23	And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
JDG.16.24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which hath slain many of us. 
JDG.16.25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made sport before them: and they set him between the pillars. 
JDG.16.26	and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them. 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 
JDG.16.28	And Samson called unto the 
JDG.16.29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left. 
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 
JDG.16.31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	And there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred 
JDG.17.3	And he restored the eleven hundred 
JDG.17.4	And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred 
JDG.17.5	And the man Micah had an house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
JDG.17.7	And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
JDG.17.8	And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find 
JDG.17.9	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find 
JDG.17.10	And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten 
JDG.17.11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then said Micah, Now know I that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day 
JDG.18.2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: and they came to the hill country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here? 
JDG.18.4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest. 
JDG.18.5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. 
JDG.18.6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put 
JDG.18.8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What 
JDG.18.9	And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slofthful to go and to enter in to possess the land. 
JDG.18.10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large: for God hath given it into your hand; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. 
JDG.18.11	And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.12	And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim. 
JDG.18.13	And they passed thence unto the hill country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. 
JDG.18.15	And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. 
JDG.18.16	And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate. 
JDG.18.17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entering of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.18	And when these went into Micah's house and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye? 
JDG.18.19	And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? 
JDG.18.20	And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. 
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them. 
JDG.18.22	When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. 
JDG.18.23	And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? 
JDG.18.24	And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee? 
JDG.18.25	And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. 
JDG.18.26	And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
JDG.18.27	And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire. 
JDG.18.28	And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein. 
JDG.18.29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. 
JDG.18.30	And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. 
JDG.18.31	So they set them up Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	And it came to pass in these days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah. 
JDG.19.2	And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months. 
JDG.19.3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 
JDG.19.4	And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 
JDG.19.5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way. 
JDG.19.6	So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel's father said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry. 
JDG.19.7	And the man rose up to depart; but his father in law urged him, and he lodged there again. 
JDG.19.8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them. 
JDG.19.9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. 
JDG.19.10	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him. 
JDG.19.11	When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. 
JDG.19.12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah. 
JDG.19.13	And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 
JDG.19.14	So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.
JDG.19.16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
JDG.19.17	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou? 
JDG.19.18	And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am 
JDG.19.19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing. 
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street. 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
JDG.19.22	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. 
JDG.19.23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly. 
JDG.19.24	Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly. 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. 
JDG.19.27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place. 
JDG.19.29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take counsel, and speak.
JDG.20.1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the 
JDG.20.2	And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword. 
JDG.20.3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass? 
JDG.20.4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. 
JDG.20.5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead. 
JDG.20.6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Behold, ye children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel. 
JDG.20.8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; 
JDG.20.10	and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you? 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore deliver up the men, the sons of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. 
JDG.20.14	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 
JDG.20.16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair-breadth, and not miss. 
JDG.20.17	And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? And the 
JDG.20.19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men. 
JDG.20.22	And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day. 
JDG.20.23	(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
JDG.20.25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
JDG.20.26	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before the 
JDG.20.27	And the children of Israel asked of the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the 
JDG.20.29	And Israel set liers in wait against Gibeah round about. 
JDG.20.30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 
JDG.20.31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel. 
JDG.20.32	And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us rise, and draw them away from the city unto the highways. 
JDG.20.33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba. 
JDG.20.34	And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was close upon them. 
JDG.20.35	And the 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city. 
JDG.20.39	And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.: 
JDG.20.40	But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up 
JDG.20.41	And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they which came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof. 
JDG.20.43	They enclosed the Benjamites round about, 
JDG.20.44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these 
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men. 
JDG.20.46	So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour. 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months. 
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 
JDG.21.2	And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore. 
JDG.21.3	And they said, O 
JDG.21.4	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
JDG.21.5	And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto the 
JDG.21.6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. 
JDG.21.7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the 
JDG.21.9	For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. 
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 
JDG.21.11	And this is the thing that ye shall do; ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man. 
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. 
JDG.21.13	And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them. 
JDG.21.14	And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not. 
JDG.21.15	And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? 
JDG.21.17	And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel. 
JDG.21.18	Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. 
JDG.21.19	And they said, Behold, there is a feast of the 
JDG.21.20	And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; 
JDG.21.21	and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us: because we took not for each man 
JDG.21.23	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them. 
JDG.21.24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. 
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
RUT.1.2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. 
RUT.1.3	And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years. 
RUT.1.5	And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the 
RUT.1.7	And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house: the 
RUT.1.9	The 
RUT.1.10	And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people. 
RUT.1.11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have an husband to-night, and should also bear sons; 
RUT.1.13	would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the 
RUT.1.14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. 
RUT.1.15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister in law. 
RUT.1.16	And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: 
RUT.1.17	where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the 
RUT.1.18	And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking unto her.
RUT.1.19	So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and 
RUT.1.20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. 
RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. 
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 
RUT.2.3	And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
RUT.2.4	And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The 
RUT.2.5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? 
RUT.2.6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 
RUT.2.7	And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house. 
RUT.2.8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens. 
RUT.2.9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. 
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? 
RUT.2.11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. 
RUT.2.12	The 
RUT.2.13	Then she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thine handmaid, though I be not as one of thine handmaidens. 
RUT.2.14	And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof. 
RUT.2.15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not. 
RUT.2.16	And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 
RUT.2.18	And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that she had left after she was sufficed. 
RUT.2.19	And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought today is Boaz. 
RUT.2.20	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the 
RUT.2.21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. 
RUT.2.22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field. 
RUT.2.23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother in law.
RUT.3.1	And Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? 
RUT.3.2	And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor. 
RUT.3.3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put on thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor: but make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. 
RUT.3.5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.
RUT.3.6	And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her. 
RUT.3.7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. 
RUT.3.8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. 
RUT.3.10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the 
RUT.3.11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. 
RUT.3.12	And now it is true that I am a near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
RUT.3.13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the 
RUT.3.14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor. 
RUT.3.15	And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it: and he measured six 
RUT.3.16	And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. 
RUT.3.17	And she said, These six 
RUT.3.18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.
RUT.4.1	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's: 
RUT.4.4	And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it. 
RUT.4.5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. 
RUT.4.6	And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it. 
RUT.4.7	Now this was 
RUT.4.8	So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.
RUT.4.9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. 
RUT.4.10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day. 
RUT.4.11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The 
RUT.4.12	and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and the 
RUT.4.14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the 
RUT.4.15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him. 
RUT.4.16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. 
RUT.4.17	And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
RUT.4.18	Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron; 
RUT.4.19	and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab; 
RUT.4.20	and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon; 
RUT.4.21	and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed; 
RUT.4.22	and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite: 
1SA.1.2	and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
1SA.1.3	And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.1.4	And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters portions: 
1SA.1.5	but unto Hannah he gave a double portion: for he loved Hannah, but the 
1SA.1.6	And her rival provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the 
1SA.1.7	And 
1SA.1.8	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1SA.1.9	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door post of the temple of the 
1SA.1.10	And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the 
1SA.1.11	And she vowed a vow, and said, O 
1SA.1.12	And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. 
1SA.1.14	And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. 
1SA.1.15	And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the 
1SA.1.16	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto. 
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him. 
1SA.1.18	And she said, Let thy servant find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more 
1SA.1.19	And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the 
1SA.1.20	And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, 
1SA.1.21	And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, 
1SA.1.23	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the 
1SA.1.24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the 
1SA.1.25	And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed; and the 
1SA.1.28	wherefore I also have granted him to the 
1SA.2.1	And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in the 
1SA.2.2	There is none holy as the 
1SA.2.3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the 
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 
1SA.2.5	They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased: yea, the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children languisheth. 
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, he lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the 
1SA.2.9	He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. 
1SA.2.10	They that strive with the 
1SA.2.11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the 
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the 
1SA.2.13	And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 
1SA.2.14	and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. 
1SA.2.15	Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 
1SA.2.16	And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force. 
1SA.2.17	And the sin of the young men was very great before the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. 
1SA.2.23	And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people. 
1SA.2.24	Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the 
1SA.2.25	If one man sin against another, God shall judge him: but if a man sin against the 
1SA.2.26	And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the 
1SA.2.27	And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1SA.2.28	and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? 
1SA.2.29	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in 
1SA.2.30	Therefore the 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. 
1SA.2.32	And thou shalt behold the affliction of 
1SA.2.33	And the man of thine, 
1SA.2.34	And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. 
1SA.2.35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. 
1SA.2.36	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
1SA.3.1	And the child Samuel ministered unto the 
1SA.3.2	And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see,) 
1SA.3.3	and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down 
1SA.3.4	that the 
1SA.3.5	And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	And the 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	And the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.11	And the 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. 
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. 
1SA.3.14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 
1SA.3.15	And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here Am I. 
1SA.3.17	And he said, What is the thing that 
1SA.3.18	And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the 
1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew, and the 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	And the 
1SA.4.1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 
1SA.4.3	And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	And when the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. 
1SA.4.8	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
1SA.4.10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1SA.4.12	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. 
1SA.4.13	And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the way side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. 
1SA.4.14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted and came and told Eli. 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son? 
1SA.4.17	And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 
1SA.4.18	And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her. 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. 
1SA.4.21	And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. 
1SA.4.22	And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.
1SA.5.1	Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.
1SA.5.6	But the hand of the 
1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon as, and upon Dagon our god. 
1SA.5.8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about 
1SA.5.9	And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. 
1SA.5.11	They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city, the hand of God was very heavy there. 
1SA.5.12	And the men that died not were smitten with the tumours: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	And the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a guilt offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 
1SA.6.4	Then said they, What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumours, and five golden mice, 
1SA.6.5	Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumours, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land: 
1SA.6.6	Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go and they departed? 
1SA.6.7	Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: 
1SA.6.8	and take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
1SA.6.10	And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: 
1SA.6.11	and they put the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. 
1SA.6.13	And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. 
1SA.6.14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt offering unto the 
1SA.6.15	And the Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. 
1SA.6.17	And these are the golden tumours which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering unto the 
1SA.6.18	and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities and of country villages: even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of the 
1SA.6.19	And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the 
1SA.6.20	And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before the 
1SA.6.21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the 
1SA.7.1	And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the 
1SA.7.4	Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served the 
1SA.7.5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto the 
1SA.7.6	And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the 
1SA.7.9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering unto the 
1SA.7.10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car. 
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of the 
1SA.7.14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
1SA.7.15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar unto the 
1SA.8.1	And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. 
1SA.8.3	And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgement.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah: 
1SA.8.5	and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel; when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
1SA.8.9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. 
1SA.8.10	And Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots: 
1SA.8.12	and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and 
1SA.8.13	And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. 
1SA.8.14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. 
1SA.8.15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. 
1SA.8.17	He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants. 
1SA.8.18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the 
1SA.8.19	But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 
1SA.8.20	that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
1SA.8.21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the 
1SA.8.22	And the 
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valour. 
1SA.9.2	And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
1SA.9.3	And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 
1SA.9.4	And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. 
1SA.9.5	When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us. 
1SA.9.6	And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go. 
1SA.9.7	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 
1SA.9.8	And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Beheld, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
1SA.9.9	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 
1SA.9.10	Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? 
1SA.9.12	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, 
1SA.9.13	as soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; 
1SA.9.14	And they went up to the city; 
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me: 
1SA.9.17	And when Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is. 
1SA.9.19	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. 
1SA.9.20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house? 
1SA.9.21	And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner? 
1SA.9.22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons. 
1SA.9.23	And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 
1SA.9.24	And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And 
1SA.9.25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop. 
1SA.9.26	And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
1SA.9.27	As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that the 
1SA.10.2	When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and taketh thought for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 
1SA.10.3	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 
1SA.10.4	and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hand. 
1SA.10.5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall be prophesying: 
1SA.10.6	and the spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee. 
1SA.10.8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
1SA.10.9	And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 
1SA.10.10	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them. 
1SA.10.11	And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? 
1SA.10.12	And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? 
1SA.10.13	And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. 
1SA.10.14	And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel. 
1SA.10.15	And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. 
1SA.10.16	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
1SA.10.17	And Samuel called the people together unto the 
1SA.10.18	and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the 
1SA.10.19	but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, 
1SA.10.20	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 
1SA.10.21	And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of the Matrites was taken: and Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they sought him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	Therefore they asked of the 
1SA.10.23	And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 
1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the 
1SA.10.26	And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	But certain sons of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
1SA.11.1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 
1SA.11.2	And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel. 
1SA.11.3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel: and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee. 
1SA.11.4	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
1SA.11.5	And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 
1SA.11.6	And the spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly. 
1SA.11.7	And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of the 
1SA.11.8	And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
1SA.11.9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. 
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. 
1SA.11.11	And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
1SA.11.12	And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death. 
1SA.11.13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then said Samuel to the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. 
1SA.11.15	And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the 
1SA.12.1	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and gray-headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am: witness against me before the 
1SA.12.4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand. 
1SA.12.5	And he said unto them, The 
1SA.12.6	And Samuel said unto the people, It is the 
1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the 
1SA.12.8	When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the 
1SA.12.9	But they forgat the 
1SA.12.10	And they cried unto the 
1SA.12.11	And the 
1SA.12.12	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us: when the 
1SA.12.13	Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, the 
1SA.12.14	If ye will fear the 
1SA.12.15	but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the 
1SA.12.16	Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call unto the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called unto the 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the 
1SA.12.20	And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have indeed done all this evil: yet turn not aside from following the 
1SA.12.21	and turn ye not aside: for 
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
1SA.13.1	Saul was 
1SA.13.2	And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 
1SA.13.3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 
1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal. 
1SA.13.5	And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in holds, and in pits. 
1SA.13.7	Now some of the Hebrews had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1SA.13.8	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had 
1SA.13.9	And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
1SA.13.11	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash; 
1SA.13.12	therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favour of the 
1SA.13.13	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the 
1SA.13.14	But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the 
1SA.13.15	And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. 
1SA.13.16	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 
1SA.13.18	and another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 
1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: 
1SA.13.20	but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock; 
1SA.13.21	yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes; and to set the goads. 
1SA.13.22	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father. 
1SA.14.2	And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men: 
1SA.14.3	and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the 
1SA.14.4	And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba. 
1SA.14.6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the 
1SA.14.7	And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee, behold I am with thee according to thy heart. 
1SA.14.8	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 
1SA.14.9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the 
1SA.14.11	And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 
1SA.14.12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the 
1SA.14.13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew them after him. 
1SA.14.14	And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land. 
1SA.14.15	And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled: and the earth quaked; so there was an exceeding great trembling.
1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went 
1SA.14.17	Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. 
1SA.14.18	And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was 
1SA.14.19	And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. 
1SA.14.20	And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, 
1SA.14.21	Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, which went up with them into the camp 
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day: but Saul adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food. 
1SA.14.25	And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground. 
1SA.14.26	And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. 
1SA.14.28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint. 
1SA.14.29	Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines. 
1SA.14.31	And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 
1SA.14.32	and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. 
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the 
1SA.14.34	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the 
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar unto the 
1SA.14.36	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 
1SA.14.37	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. 
1SA.14.38	And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. 
1SA.14.39	For, as the 
1SA.14.40	Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. 
1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul said unto the 
1SA.14.42	And Saul said, Cast 
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand; and, lo, I must die. 
1SA.14.44	And Saul said, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 
1SA.14.45	And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed 
1SA.14.48	And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. 
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 
1SA.14.50	and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. 
1SA.14.51	And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. 
1SA.14.52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
1SA.15.1	And Samuel said unto Saul, The 
1SA.15.2	Thus saith the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. 
1SA.15.4	And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
1SA.15.7	And Saul Smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
1SA.15.10	Then came the word of the 
1SA.15.11	It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto the 
1SA.15.12	And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 
1SA.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the 
1SA.15.14	And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? 
1SA.15.15	And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the 
1SA.15.17	And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the 
1SA.15.18	and the 
1SA.15.19	wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the 
1SA.15.20	And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.22	And Samuel said, Hath the 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.24	And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent. 
1SA.15.28	And Samuel said unto him, The 
1SA.15.29	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent. 
1SA.15.30	Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the 
1SA.15.32	Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. 
1SA.15.33	And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and the 
1SA.16.1	And the 
1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the 
1SA.16.3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. 
1SA.16.4	And Samuel did that which the 
1SA.16.5	And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.16.6	And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the 
1SA.16.10	And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. 
1SA.16.12	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And the 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	Now the spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man who is a cunning player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. 
1SA.16.17	And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me. 
1SA.16.18	Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person, and the 
1SA.16.19	Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep. 
1SA.16.20	And Jesse took an ass 
1SA.16.21	And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. 
1SA.16.22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 
1SA.16.23	And it came to pass, when the 
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
1SA.17.5	And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. 
1SA.17.6	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders. 
1SA.17.7	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head 
1SA.17.8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. 
1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
1SA.17.11	And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken 
1SA.17.13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul. 
1SA.17.15	Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem. 
1SA.17.16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 
1SA.17.17	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and carry 
1SA.17.18	and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
1SA.17.19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
1SA.17.20	And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. 
1SA.17.21	And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren. 
1SA.17.23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them. 
1SA.17.24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. 
1SA.17.25	And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel. 
1SA.17.26	And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 
1SA.17.27	And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him. 
1SA.17.28	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 
1SA.17.29	And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? 
1SA.17.30	And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1SA.17.31	And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him. 
1SA.17.32	And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 
1SA.17.33	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 
1SA.17.34	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 
1SA.17.36	Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 
1SA.17.37	And David said, The 
1SA.17.38	And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail. 
1SA.17.39	And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
1SA.17.40	And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. 
1SA.17.41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. 
1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance. 
1SA.17.43	And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 
1SA.17.45	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This day will the 
1SA.17.47	and that all this assembly may know that the 
1SA.17.48	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth. 
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their camp. 
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 
1SA.17.55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. 
1SA.17.56	And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is. 
1SA.17.57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.
1SA.18.1	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.2	And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 
1SA.18.5	And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, 
1SA.18.6	And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music. 
1SA.18.7	And the women sang one to another in their play, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 
1SA.18.8	And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? 
1SA.18.9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
1SA.18.10	And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day: and Saul had his spear in his hand. 
1SA.18.11	and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
1SA.18.12	And Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
1SA.18.14	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the 
1SA.18.15	And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them. 
1SA.18.17	And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the 
1SA.18.18	And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, 
1SA.18.19	But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 
1SA.18.20	And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law a second time. 
1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his servants, 
1SA.18.23	And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? 
1SA.18.24	And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. 
1SA.18.25	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law. And the days were not expired; 
1SA.18.27	and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
1SA.18.28	And Saul saw and knew that the 
1SA.18.29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually. 
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
1SA.19.1	And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David. 
1SA.19.2	And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 
1SA.19.3	and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee. 
1SA.19.4	And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good: 
1SA.19.5	for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the 
1SA.19.6	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the 
1SA.19.7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.
1SA.19.8	And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him. 
1SA.19.9	And an evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
1SA.19.11	And Saul sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, tomorrow thou shalt be slain. 
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped; 
1SA.19.13	And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' 
1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick. 
1SA.19.15	And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. 
1SA.19.16	And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' 
1SA.19.17	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
1SA.19.18	Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.20	And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied; 
1SA.19.21	And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.23	And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.20.1	And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? 
1SA.20.2	And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. 
1SA.20.3	And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the 
1SA.20.4	Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee. 
1SA.20.5	And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. 
1SA.20.6	If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family. 
1SA.20.7	If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him. 
1SA.20.8	Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the 
1SA.20.9	And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? 
1SA.20.10	Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly? 
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said unto David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field. 
1SA.20.12	And Jonathan said unto David, The 
1SA.20.13	The 
1SA.20.14	And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the 
1SA.20.15	but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, 
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul. 
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said unto him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark. 
1SA.20.21	And, behold, I will send the lad, 
1SA.20.22	But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee: go thy way; for the 
1SA.20.23	And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat. 
1SA.20.25	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. 
1SA.20.27	And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, 
1SA.20.28	And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem: 
1SA.20.29	and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me 
1SA.20.30	Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's nakedness? 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be stablished, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. 
1SA.20.32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done? 
1SA.20.33	And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death. 
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
1SA.20.35	And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. 
1SA.20.36	And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee? 
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
1SA.20.40	And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city. 
1SA.20.41	And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of 
1SA.20.42	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the 
1SA.21.1	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee? 
1SA.21.2	And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place. 
1SA.21.3	Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or whatsoever there is present. 
1SA.21.4	And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women. 
1SA.21.5	And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then today shall their vessels be holy? 
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him holy 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste. 
1SA.21.9	And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slowest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
1SA.21.10	And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 
1SA.21.12	And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. 
1SA.21.14	Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I lack mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
1SA.22.1	David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him. 
1SA.22.2	And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. 
1SA.22.3	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, 
1SA.22.4	And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold. 
1SA.22.5	And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. 
1SA.22.7	And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds; 
1SA.22.8	that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
1SA.22.9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	And he inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. 
1SA.22.12	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. 
1SA.22.13	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, which is the king's son in law, and is taken into thy council, and is honourable in thine house? 
1SA.22.15	Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more. 
1SA.22.16	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. 
1SA.22.17	And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
1SA.22.20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 
1SA.22.21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the 
1SA.22.22	And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned 
1SA.22.23	Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
1SA.23.1	And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors. 
1SA.23.2	Therefore David inquired of the 
1SA.23.3	And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 
1SA.23.4	Then David inquired of the 
1SA.23.5	And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew therewith a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
1SA.23.7	And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
1SA.23.8	And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	And David knew that Saul devised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
1SA.23.10	Then said David, O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O 
1SA.23.12	Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the 
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
1SA.23.14	And David abode in the wilderness in the strong holds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 
1SA.23.15	And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood. 
1SA.23.16	And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 
1SA.23.17	And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
1SA.23.18	And they two made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert? 
1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deriver him up into the king's hand. 
1SA.23.21	And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the 
1SA.23.22	Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, 
1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah. 
1SA.23.24	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert. 
1SA.23.25	And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard 
1SA.23.26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. 
1SA.23.27	But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land. 
1SA.23.28	So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth. 
1SA.23.29	And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strong holds of En-gedi.
1SA.24.1	And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi. 
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 
1SA.24.3	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave. 
1SA.24.4	And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 
1SA.24.6	And he said unto his men, The 
1SA.24.7	So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. 
1SA.24.8	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.
1SA.24.9	And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 
1SA.24.10	Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my soul to take it. 
1SA.24.12	The 
1SA.24.13	As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 
1SA.24.14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 
1SA.24.17	And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil. 
1SA.24.18	And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the 
1SA.24.19	For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the 
1SA.24.20	And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. 
1SA.24.21	Swear now therefore unto me by the 
1SA.24.22	And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
1SA.25.1	And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1SA.25.2	And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. 
1SA.25.4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: 
1SA.25.6	and thus shall ye say to him that liveth 
1SA.25.7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David. 
1SA.25.9	And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. 
1SA.25.10	And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. 
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they be?
1SA.25.12	So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words. 
1SA.25.13	And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. 
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he flew upon them. 
1SA.25.15	But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields: 
1SA.25.16	they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a son of Belial, that one cannot speak to him.
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. 
1SA.25.19	And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them. 
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man child. 
1SA.25.23	And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thine handmaid. 
1SA.25.25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: hut I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. 
1SA.25.26	Now therefore, my lord, as the 
1SA.25.27	And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord. 
1SA.25.28	Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thine handmaid: for the 
1SA.25.29	And though man be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the 
1SA.25.30	And it shall come to pass, when the 
1SA.25.31	that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: and when the 
1SA.25.32	And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the 
1SA.25.33	and blessed be thy wisdom, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. 
1SA.25.34	For in very deed, as the 
1SA.25.35	So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
1SA.25.36	And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. 
1SA.25.37	And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 
1SA.25.38	And it came to pass about ten days after, that the 
1SA.25.39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the 
1SA.25.40	And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. 
1SA.25.41	And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thine handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. 
1SA.25.42	And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. 
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives. 
1SA.25.44	Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the Son of Laish, which was of Gallim.
1SA.26.1	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert? 
1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. 
1SA.26.4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty. 
1SA.26.5	And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people pitched round about him.
1SA.26.6	Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head: and Abner and the people lay round about him. 
1SA.26.8	Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time. 
1SA.26.9	And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can put forth his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	And David said, As the 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the 
1SA.26.13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them: 
1SA.26.14	and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saving, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? 
1SA.26.15	And David said to Abner, Art not thou a 
1SA.26.16	This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the 
1SA.26.17	And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. 
1SA.26.18	And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be the 
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the 
1SA.26.21	Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. 
1SA.26.22	And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it. 
1SA.26.23	And the 
1SA.26.24	And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand. 
1SA.27.2	And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. 
1SA.27.4	And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. 
1SA.27.5	And David said unto Achish, If now I have found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee? 
1SA.27.6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 
1SA.27.7	And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1SA.27.8	And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites: for those 
1SA.27.9	And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish. 
1SA.27.10	And Achish said, Whither have ye made a raid today? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites. 
1SA.27.11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying: So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines. 
1SA.27.12	And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
1SA.28.1	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men. 
1SA.28.2	And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. 
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 
1SA.28.4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 
1SA.28.6	And when Saul inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor. 
1SA.28.8	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee. 
1SA.28.9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? 
1SA.28.10	And Saul sware to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. 
1SA.28.12	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. 
1SA.28.13	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth. 
1SA.28.14	And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
1SA.28.15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. 
1SA.28.16	And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the 
1SA.28.17	And the 
1SA.28.18	Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the 
1SA.28.19	Moreover the 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. 
1SA.28.21	And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 
1SA.28.22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
1SA.28.23	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
1SA.28.24	And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: 
1SA.28.25	and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by the fountain which is in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish. 
1SA.29.3	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away 
1SA.29.4	But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this 
1SA.29.5	Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As the 
1SA.29.7	Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. 
1SA.29.8	And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king? 
1SA.29.9	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle. 
1SA.29.10	Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. 
1SA.29.11	So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 
1SA.30.2	and had taken captive the women 
1SA.30.3	And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. 
1SA.30.5	And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
1SA.30.6	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the 
1SA.30.7	And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 
1SA.30.8	And David inquired of the 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. 
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor: 
1SA.30.11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink: 
1SA.30.12	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. 
1SA.30.13	And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. 
1SA.30.14	We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. 
1SA.30.15	And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop. 
1SA.30.16	And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and feasting, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken: and David rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David brought back all. 
1SA.30.20	And David took all the flocks and the herds, 
1SA.30.21	And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. 
1SA.30.22	Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away and depart. 
1SA.30.23	Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the 
1SA.30.24	And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall share alike. 
1SA.30.25	And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel, unto this day. 
1SA.30.26	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the 
1SA.30.27	To them which were in Beth-el, and to them which were in Ramoth of the South, and to them which were in Jattir; 
1SA.30.28	and to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa; 
1SA.30.29	and to them which were in Racal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites; 
1SA.30.30	and to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Cor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach; 
1SA.30.31	and to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. 
1SA.31.3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it. 
1SA.31.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. 
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1SA.31.8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people. 
1SA.31.10	And they put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
1SA.31.11	And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
1SA.31.13	And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 
2SA.1.2	it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. 
2SA.1.3	And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 
2SA.1.4	And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. 
2SA.1.5	And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? 
2SA.1.6	And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. 
2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. 
2SA.1.8	And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. 
2SA.1.9	And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for anguish hath taken hold of me; because my life is yet whole in me. 
2SA.1.10	So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: 
2SA.1.12	and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the 
2SA.1.13	And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. 
2SA.1.14	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thine hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. 
2SA.1.16	And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the 
2SA.1.17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: 
2SA.1.18	And he bade them teach the children of Judah 
2SA.1.19	Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! how are the mighty fallen! 
2SA.1.20	Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 
2SA.1.21	Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil. 
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. 
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. 
2SA.1.24	Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel. 
2SA.1.25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places. 
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. 
2SA.1.27	How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
2SA.2.1	And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the 
2SA.2.2	So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
2SA.2.3	And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul. 
2SA.2.5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the 
2SA.2.6	And now the 
2SA.2.7	Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant: for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2SA.2.8	Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 
2SA.2.9	and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	(Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.) But the house of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
2SA.2.12	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 
2SA.2.15	Then they arose and went over by number; twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 
2SA.2.16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and 
2SA.2.17	And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. 
2SA.2.19	And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I. 
2SA.2.21	And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him. 
2SA.2.22	And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? 
2SA.2.23	Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the belly, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. 
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2SA.2.25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of an hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? 
2SA.2.27	And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother. 
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. 
2SA.2.29	And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.30	And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, 
2SA.2.32	And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.
2SA.3.1	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. 
2SA.3.2	And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 
2SA.3.3	and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. 
2SA.3.6	And it come to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and 
2SA.3.8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I shew kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman. 
2SA.3.9	God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the 
2SA.3.10	to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba. 
2SA.3.11	And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him. 
2SA.3.12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying 
2SA.3.13	And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face. 
2SA.3.14	And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. 
2SA.3.15	And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned. 
2SA.3.17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you: 
2SA.3.18	now then do it: for the 
2SA.3.19	And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. 
2SA.3.20	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. 
2SA.3.21	And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? 
2SA.3.25	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest. 
2SA.3.26	And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not. 
2SA.3.27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the belly, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. 
2SA.3.28	And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the 
2SA.3.29	let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread. 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. 
2SA.3.31	And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier. 
2SA.3.32	And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth? 
2SA.3.34	Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down. 
2SA.3.36	And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. 
2SA.3.37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
2SA.3.38	And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the 
2SA.4.1	And when 
2SA.4.2	And 
2SA.4.3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.) 
2SA.4.4	Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. 
2SA.4.5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon. 
2SA.4.6	And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the belly: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
2SA.4.7	Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night. 
2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the 
2SA.4.9	And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the 
2SA.4.10	when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings. 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
2SA.4.12	And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
2SA.5.2	In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six mouths: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 
2SA.5.8	And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and 
2SA.5.9	And David dwelt in the strong hold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. 
2SA.5.10	And David waxed greater and greater; for the 
2SA.5.11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. 
2SA.5.12	And David perceived that the 
2SA.5.13	And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. 
2SA.5.14	And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	and Ibhar, and Elishua; and Nepheg, and Japhia; 
2SA.5.16	and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. 
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	And David inquired of the 
2SA.5.20	And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, The 
2SA.5.21	And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away. 
2SA.5.22	And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	And when David inquired of the 
2SA.5.24	And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then is the 
2SA.5.25	And David did so, as the 
2SA.6.1	And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
2SA.6.2	And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of the 
2SA.6.3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. 
2SA.6.4	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. 
2SA.6.5	And David and all the house of Israel played before the 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth 
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David was displeased, because the 
2SA.6.9	And David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David would not remove the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	And the ark of the 
2SA.6.12	And it was told king David, saying, The 
2SA.6.13	And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	And David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	And it was so, as the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	And they brought in the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion 
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! 
2SA.6.21	And David said unto Michal, 
2SA.6.22	And I will be yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. 
2SA.6.23	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the 
2SA.7.2	that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 
2SA.7.3	And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the 
2SA.7.4	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of the 
2SA.7.5	Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the 
2SA.7.6	for I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
2SA.7.7	In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedar? 
2SA.7.8	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the 
2SA.7.9	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. 
2SA.7.10	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 
2SA.7.11	and 
2SA.7.12	When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 
2SA.7.15	but my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 
2SA.7.16	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 
2SA.7.17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
2SA.7.18	Then David the king went in, and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord 
2SA.7.20	And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord 
2SA.7.21	For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it. 
2SA.7.22	Wherefore thou art great, O 
2SA.7.23	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, 
2SA.7.24	And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, 
2SA.7.25	And now, O 
2SA.7.26	And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The 
2SA.7.27	For thou, O 
2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord 
2SA.7.29	now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord 
2SA.8.1	And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. 
2SA.8.2	And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full fine to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. 
2SA.8.3	David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River. 
2SA.8.4	And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. 
2SA.8.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought presents. And the 
2SA.8.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
2SA.8.9	And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And 
2SA.8.11	These also did king David dedicate unto the 
2SA.8.12	of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 
2SA.8.13	And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. 
2SA.8.14	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the 
2SA.8.15	And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgement and justice unto all his people. 
2SA.8.16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder: 
2SA.8.17	and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; 
2SA.8.18	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada 
2SA.9.1	And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake? 
2SA.9.2	And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. 
2SA.9.3	And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. 
2SA.9.4	And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. 
2SA.9.5	Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 
2SA.9.6	And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! 
2SA.9.7	And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 
2SA.9.8	And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
2SA.9.9	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son. 
2SA.9.10	And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in 
2SA.9.11	Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, 
2SA.9.12	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and he was lame on both his feet.
2SA.10.1	And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 
2SA.10.2	And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
2SA.10.3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
2SA.10.6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. 
2SA.10.7	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
2SA.10.8	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah, and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
2SA.10.9	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: 
2SA.10.10	And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. 
2SA.10.11	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 
2SA.10.12	Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the 
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
2SA.10.16	And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head. 
2SA.10.17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 
2SA.10.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians 
2SA.10.19	And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
2SA.11.1	And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out 
2SA.11.2	And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. 
2SA.11.3	And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? 
2SA.11.4	And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; (for she was purified from her uncleanness;) and she returned unto her house. 
2SA.11.5	And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
2SA.11.6	And David sent to Joab, 
2SA.11.7	And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. 
2SA.11.8	And David said to Uriah, Go down thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thine house? 
2SA.11.11	And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. 
2SA.11.12	And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 
2SA.11.13	And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
2SA.11.14	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. 
2SA.11.16	And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were. 
2SA.11.17	And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 
2SA.11.19	and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king, 
2SA.11.20	it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. 
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for. 
2SA.11.23	And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. 
2SA.11.25	Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. 
2SA.11.26	And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.1	And the 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 
2SA.12.4	And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. 
2SA.12.5	And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the 
2SA.12.6	and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. 
2SA.12.7	And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the 
2SA.12.8	and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things. 
2SA.12.9	Wherefore hast thou despised the word of the 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 
2SA.12.11	Thus saith the 
2SA.12.12	For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. 
2SA.12.13	And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.14	Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the 
2SA.12.15	And Nathan departed unto his house. And the 
2SA.12.16	David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. 
2SA.12.17	And the elders of his house arose, 
2SA.12.18	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? 
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants whispered together, David perceived that the child was dead: and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 
2SA.12.20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of the 
2SA.12.21	Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 
2SA.12.22	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether the 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. 
2SA.12.24	And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the 
2SA.12.25	and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah, for the 
2SA.12.26	Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 
2SA.12.27	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, yea, I have taken the city of waters. 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. 
2SA.12.29	And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 
2SA.12.30	And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and 
2SA.12.31	And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 
2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her. 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. 
2SA.13.4	And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. 
2SA.13.5	And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand. 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. 
2SA.13.7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food. 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. 
2SA.13.9	And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. 
2SA.13.10	And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 
2SA.13.11	And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. 
2SA.13.12	And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. 
2SA.13.13	And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 
2SA.13.14	Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her. 
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone. 
2SA.13.16	And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her. 
2SA.13.18	And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. 
2SA.13.19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went. 
2SA.13.20	And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
2SA.13.21	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. 
2SA.13.22	And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.23	And it came to pass after two years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons. 
2SA.13.24	And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant. 
2SA.13.25	And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. 
2SA.13.26	Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. 
2SA.13.28	And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. 
2SA.13.29	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
2SA.13.30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. 
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 
2SA.13.32	And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. 
2SA.13.34	But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him. 
2SA.13.35	And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is. 
2SA.13.36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. 
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 
2SA.13.39	And 
2SA.14.1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 
2SA.14.3	and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. 
2SA.14.4	And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. 
2SA.14.5	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered; Of a truth I am a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him. 
2SA.14.7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also: thus shall they quench my coal which is left, and shall leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth. 
2SA.14.8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee. 
2SA.14.9	And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless. 
2SA.14.10	And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. 
2SA.14.11	Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. 
2SA.14.13	And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one which is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. 
2SA.14.14	For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him. 
2SA.14.15	Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 
2SA.14.17	Then thine handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and the 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. 
2SA.14.19	And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid; 
2SA.14.20	to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
2SA.14.21	And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. 
2SA.14.22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: end Joab said, Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant. 
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. 
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
2SA.14.26	And when he polled his head, (now it was at every year's end that he polled it: because 
2SA.14.27	And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
2SA.14.28	And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king's face. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. 
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? 
2SA.14.32	And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me. 
2SA.14.33	So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
2SA.15.2	And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgement, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. 
2SA.15.3	And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. 
2SA.15.4	Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 
2SA.15.5	And it was so, that when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. 
2SA.15.6	And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgement: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the 
2SA.15.8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the 
2SA.15.9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron. 
2SA.15.11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not any thing. 
2SA.15.12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
2SA.15.13	And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 
2SA.15.14	And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 
2SA.15.15	And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose. 
2SA.15.16	And the king went forth, and all his household after him, And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house. 
2SA.15.17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak. 
2SA.15.18	And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. 
2SA.15.19	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile; 
2SA.15.20	Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee. 
2SA.15.21	And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the 
2SA.15.22	And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him. 
2SA.15.23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	And, lo, Zadok also 
2SA.15.25	And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the 
2SA.15.26	but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 
2SA.15.27	The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou 
2SA.15.28	See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 
2SA.15.29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there. 
2SA.15.30	And David went up by the ascent of the 
2SA.15.31	And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O 
2SA.15.32	And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top 
2SA.15.33	And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: 
2SA.15.34	but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant: then shalt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. 
2SA.15.35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
2SA.15.36	Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye shall hear. 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai David's friend came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	And when David was a little past the top 
2SA.16.2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. 
2SA.16.3	And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 
2SA.16.4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.
2SA.16.5	And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came out, and cursed still as he came. 
2SA.16.6	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 
2SA.16.7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and man of Belial: 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. 
2SA.16.10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because the 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men went by the way: and Shimei went along on the hill side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 
2SA.16.14	And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.
2SA.16.15	And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
2SA.16.16	And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. 
2SA.16.17	And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
2SA.16.18	And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the 
2SA.16.19	And again, whom should I serve? 
2SA.16.20	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do. 
2SA.16.21	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong. 
2SA.16.22	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: 
2SA.17.2	and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: 
2SA.17.4	And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. 
2SA.17.5	Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. 
2SA.17.6	And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do 
2SA.17.7	And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good. 
2SA.17.8	Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. 
2SA.17.9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some 
2SA.17.10	And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men. 
2SA.17.11	But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 
2SA.17.12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one. 
2SA.17.13	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. 
2SA.17.14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the 
2SA.17.15	Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests. Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but in any wise pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him. 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and a maidservant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither. 
2SA.17.19	And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised corn thereon; and nothing was known. 
2SA.17.20	And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. 
2SA.17.21	And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
2SA.17.22	Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan. 
2SA.17.23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. 
2SA.17.26	And Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 
2SA.17.27	And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched 
2SA.17.29	and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
2SA.18.1	And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
2SA.18.2	And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. 
2SA.18.3	But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succour us out of the city. 
2SA.18.4	And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. 
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. 
2SA.18.8	For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country: and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went on. 
2SA.18.10	And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak. 
2SA.18.11	And Joab said unto the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten 
2SA.18.12	And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life, (and there is no matter hid from the king,) then thou thyself wouldest have stood aloof. 
2SA.18.14	Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. 
2SA.18.16	And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
2SA.18.17	And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his life time had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called Absalom's monument, unto this day.
2SA.18.19	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the 
2SA.18.20	And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 
2SA.18.21	Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. 
2SA.18.22	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings? 
2SA.18.23	But come what may, 
2SA.18.24	Now David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. 
2SA.18.26	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, 
2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings. 
2SA.18.28	And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be the 
2SA.18.29	And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. 
2SA.18.30	And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. 
2SA.18.31	And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king: for the 
2SA.18.32	And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is. 
2SA.18.33	And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2SA.19.1	And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. 
2SA.19.2	And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son. 
2SA.19.3	And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
2SA.19.4	And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
2SA.19.5	And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
2SA.19.6	in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. 
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
2SA.19.9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? 
2SA.19.11	And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, 
2SA.19.12	Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 
2SA.19.13	And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 
2SA.19.14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as 
2SA.19.15	So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over Jordan.
2SA.19.16	And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 
2SA.19.17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through Jordan in the presence of the king. 
2SA.19.18	And there went over a ferry boat to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over Jordan. 
2SA.19.19	And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 
2SA.19.20	For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. 
2SA.19.21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? 
2SA.19.23	And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
2SA.19.24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. 
2SA.19.25	And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 
2SA.19.26	And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame. 
2SA.19.27	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 
2SA.19.28	For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king? 
2SA.19.29	And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
2SA.19.30	And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house:
2SA.19.31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 
2SA.19.33	And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem. 
2SA.19.34	And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Thy servant would but just go over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
2SA.19.37	Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. 
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. 
2SA.19.39	And all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
2SA.19.40	So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. 
2SA.19.41	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king; and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over Jordan, and all David's men with him? 
2SA.19.42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift? 
2SA.19.43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king; and we have also more 
2SA.20.1	And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. 
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 
2SA.20.3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
2SA.20.4	Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present. 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to call 
2SA.20.6	And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape out of our sight. 
2SA.20.7	And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 
2SA.20.9	And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the belly, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab. 
2SA.20.12	And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. 
2SA.20.13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. 
2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mount against the city, and it stood against the rampart: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. 
2SA.20.16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. 
2SA.20.17	And he came near unto her, and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. 
2SA.20.18	Then she spake, saying, they were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask 
2SA.20.19	I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the 
2SA.20.20	And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 
2SA.20.21	The matter is not so: but a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 
2SA.20.24	and Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder: 
2SA.20.25	and Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were priests: 
2SA.20.26	and Ira also the Jairite was priest unto David.
2SA.21.1	And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the 
2SA.21.2	And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah:) 
2SA.21.3	and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the 
2SA.21.4	And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you. 
2SA.21.5	And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: 
2SA.21.9	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the 
2SA.21.10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
2SA.21.12	And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa: 
2SA.21.13	and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 
2SA.21.14	And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
2SA.21.15	And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint, 
2SA.21.16	and Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred 
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel. 
2SA.21.18	And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant. 
2SA.21.19	And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
2SA.21.20	And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. 
2SA.21.21	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei David's brother slew him. 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	And David spake unto the 
2SA.22.2	and he said, The 
2SA.22.3	The God of my rock, in him will I trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; my saviour, thou savest me from violence. 
2SA.22.4	I will call upon the 
2SA.22.5	For the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodliness made me afraid. 
2SA.22.6	The cords of Sheol were round about me: the snares of death came upon me. 
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon the 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of heaven moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. 
2SA.22.9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under his feet. 
2SA.22.11	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind. 
2SA.22.12	And he made darkness pavilions round about him, gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies. 
2SA.22.13	At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled. 
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. 
2SA.22.16	Then the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid bare, by the rebuke of the 
2SA.22.17	He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; 
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy, from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me. 
2SA.22.19	They came upon me in the day of my calamity: but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.23	For all his judgements were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. 
2SA.22.24	I was also perfect toward him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. 
2SA.22.25	Therefore hath the 
2SA.22.26	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, with the perfect man thou wilt shew thyself perfect; 
2SA.22.27	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt shew thyself froward. 
2SA.22.28	And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down. 
2SA.22.29	For thou art my lamp, O 
2SA.22.30	For by thee I run upon a troop: by my God do I leap over a wall. 
2SA.22.31	As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the 
2SA.22.32	For who is God, save the 
2SA.22.33	God is my strong fortress: and he guideth the perfect in his way. 
2SA.22.34	He maketh his feet like hinds' 
2SA.22.35	He teacheth my hands to war; so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. 
2SA.22.36	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. 
2SA.22.37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped. 
2SA.22.38	I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
2SA.22.39	And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise; yea, they are fallen under my feet. 
2SA.22.40	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
2SA.22.41	Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, that I might cut off them that hate me. 
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the 
2SA.22.43	Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad. 
2SA.22.44	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: a people whom I have not known shall serve me. 
2SA.22.45	The strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me. 
2SA.22.46	The strangers shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places. 
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.48	Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and bringeth down peoples under me, 
2SA.22.49	And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me: thou deliverest me from the violent man. 
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O 
2SA.22.51	Great deliverance giveth he to his king: and sheweth lovingkindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.
2SA.23.1	Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse saith, and the man who was raised on high saith, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel: 
2SA.23.2	The spirit of the 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, that ruleth in the fear of God, 
2SA.23.4	 as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; 
2SA.23.5	Verily my house is not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for it is all my salvation, and all 
2SA.23.6	But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, for they cannot be taken with the hand: 
2SA.23.7	But the man that toucheth them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in 
2SA.23.8	These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time. 
2SA.23.9	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: 
2SA.23.10	He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the 
2SA.23.11	And after him was Shammah the son of Agce a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the 
2SA.23.13	And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	And David was then in the hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. 
2SA.23.15	And David longed and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem which is by the gate! 
2SA.23.16	And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the 
2SA.23.17	And he said, Be it far from me, O 
2SA.23.18	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. 
2SA.23.19	Was he not most honourable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the 
2SA.23.20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two 
2SA.23.21	And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. 
2SA.23.23	He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the 
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; 
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite; 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; 
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite; 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite; 
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin; 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash; 
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite; 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan; 
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite; 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite; 
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite; 
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite; 
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah; 
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; 
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
2SA.24.1	And again the anger of the 
2SA.24.2	And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people. 
2SA.24.3	And Joab said unto the king, Now the 
2SA.24.4	Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer, 
2SA.24.6	then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Zidon, 
2SA.24.7	and came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba. 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
2SA.24.10	And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the 
2SA.24.11	And when David rose up in the morning, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	Go and speak unto David, Thus saith the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me. 
2SA.24.14	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the 
2SA.24.17	And David spake unto the 
2SA.24.18	And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the 
2SA.24.19	And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as the 
2SA.24.20	And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
2SA.24.21	And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto the 
2SA.24.22	And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the furniture of the oxen for the wood: 
2SA.24.23	all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The 
2SA.24.24	And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the 
2SA.24.25	And David built there an altar unto the 
1KI.1.1	Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. 
1KI.1.2	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
1KI.1.5	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1KI.1.6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom. 
1KI.1.7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 
1KI.1.9	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: 
1KI.1.10	but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? 
1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 
1KI.1.14	Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words. 
1KI.1.15	And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king. 
1KI.1.16	And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 
1KI.1.17	And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the 
1KI.1.18	And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not: 
1KI.1.19	and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 
1KI.1.20	And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. 
1KI.1.22	And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
1KI.1.23	And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
1KI.1.25	For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. 
1KI.1.26	But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. 
1KI.1.27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? 
1KI.1.28	Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	And the king sware, and said, As the 
1KI.1.30	verily as I sware unto thee by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1KI.1.32	And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	And the king, said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mute, and bring him down to Gihon: 
1KI.1.34	and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
1KI.1.35	Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah. 
1KI.1.36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. 
1KI.1.40	And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1KI.1.41	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? 
1KI.1.42	While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings. 
1KI.1.43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king: 
1KI.1.44	and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: 
1KI.1.45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. 
1KI.1.46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
1KI.1.47	And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne, and the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
1KI.1.48	And also thus said the king, Blessed be the 
1KI.1.49	And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 
1KI.1.50	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me this day that he wilt not slay his servant with the sword. 
1KI.1.52	And Solomon said, If he shall shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die. 
1KI.1.53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
1KI.2.1	Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	I go the way of all the earth: he thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 
1KI.2.3	and keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	That the 
1KI.2.5	Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 
1KI.2.7	But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother. 
1KI.2.8	And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave with blood. 
1KI.2.10	And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
1KI.2.11	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. 
1KI.2.13	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 
1KI.2.14	He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. 
1KI.2.15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the 
1KI.2.16	And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. 
1KI.2.17	And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
1KI.2.18	And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. 
1KI.2.19	Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee. 
1KI.2.21	And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. 
1KI.2.22	And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
1KI.2.23	Then king Solomon sware by the 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore as the 
1KI.2.25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, that he died.
1KI.2.26	And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the 
1KI.2.28	And the tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of the 
1KI.2.29	And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of the 
1KI.2.30	And Benaiah came to the Tent of the 
1KI.2.31	And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house. 
1KI.2.32	And the 
1KI.2.33	So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the 
1KI.2.34	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1KI.2.35	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. 
1KI.2.36	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 
1KI.2.37	For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 
1KI.2.38	And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 
1KI.2.39	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying; Behold, thy servants be in Gath. 
1KI.2.40	And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. 
1KI.2.42	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the 
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the 
1KI.2.45	But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the 
1KI.3.2	Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the 
1KI.3.3	And Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 
1KI.3.7	And now, O 
1KI.3.8	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 
1KI.3.9	Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people? 
1KI.3.10	And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgement; 
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 
1KI.3.13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days. 
1KI.3.14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. 
1KI.3.15	And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.3.16	Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, Oh my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
1KI.3.18	And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 
1KI.3.19	And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 
1KI.3.20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. 
1KI.3.22	And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. 
1KI.3.23	Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. 
1KI.3.24	And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
1KI.3.26	Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, Oh my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it. 
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. 
1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of the judgement which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgement.
1KI.4.1	And king Solomon was king over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; 
1KI.4.4	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
1KI.4.5	and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was priest, 
1KI.4.6	and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy. 
1KI.4.7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year: 
1KI.4.8	And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim: 
1KI.4.9	Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: 
1KI.4.10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth; to him 
1KI.4.11	Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam: 
1KI.4.13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim: 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
1KI.4.16	Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth: 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin: 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and 
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. 
1KI.4.21	And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
1KI.4.22	And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; 
1KI.4.23	ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all 
1KI.4.25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
1KI.4.27	And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they let nothing be lacking. 
1KI.4.28	Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where 
1KI.4.29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. 
1KI.4.30	And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about. 
1KI.4.32	And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 
1KI.4.33	And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 
1KI.4.34	And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
1KI.5.2	And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
1KI.5.3	Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house for the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	And, behold, I purpose to build an house for the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians. 
1KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the 
1KI.5.8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard 
1KI.5.9	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
1KI.5.10	So Hirah gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire. 
1KI.5.11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. 
1KI.5.12	And the 
1KI.5.13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy. 
1KI.5.15	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; 
1KI.5.16	besides Solomon's chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. 
1KI.5.17	And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone. 
1KI.5.18	And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
1KI.6.1	And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the 
1KI.6.2	And the house which king Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; 
1KI.6.4	And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work. 
1KI.6.5	And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made side-chambers round about: 
1KI.6.6	The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for on the outside he made rebatements 
1KI.6.7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry: and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 
1KI.6.8	The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle 
1KI.6.9	So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
1KI.6.11	And the word of the 
1KI.6.12	Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgements, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father. 
1KI.6.13	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. 
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1KI.6.15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house unto the walls of the cieling, he covered them on the inside with wood: and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir. 
1KI.6.16	And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls: he even built 
1KI.6.17	And the house, that is, the temple before 
1KI.6.18	And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. 
1KI.6.19	And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	And within the oracle was 
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold. 
1KI.6.23	And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high. 
1KI.6.24	And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. 
1KI.6.25	And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. 
1KI.6.26	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. 
1KI.6.27	And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
1KI.6.28	And he overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
1KI.6.29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 
1KI.6.30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 
1KI.6.31	And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel 
1KI.6.32	So 
1KI.6.33	So also made he for the entering of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part 
1KI.6.34	and two doors of fir wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 
1KI.6.35	And he carved 
1KI.6.36	And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams. 
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the 
1KI.6.38	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
1KI.7.1	And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
1KI.7.2	For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 
1KI.7.3	And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row. 
1KI.7.4	And there were prospects in three rows, and light was over against light in three ranks. 
1KI.7.5	And all the doors and posts were square in prospect: and light was over against light in three ranks. 
1KI.7.6	And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and thick beams before them. 
1KI.7.7	And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgement: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor. 
1KI.7.8	And his house where he might dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, (whom Solomon had taken to wife,) like unto this porch. 
1KI.7.9	All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court. 
1KI.7.10	And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 
1KI.7.11	And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar wood. 
1KI.7.12	And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of the 
1KI.7.13	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He was the son of a widow woman of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
1KI.7.15	For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about. 
1KI.7.16	And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits. 
1KI.7.17	There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 
1KI.7.18	So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other chapiter. 
1KI.7.19	And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits. 
1KI.7.20	And there were chapiters above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other chapiter. 
1KI.7.21	And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. 
1KI.7.22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. 
1KI.7.23	And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about. 
1KI.7.24	And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 
1KI.7.25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. 
1KI.7.26	And it was an handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths. 
1KI.7.27	And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. 
1KI.7.28	And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the ledges: 
1KI.7.29	and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above: and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. 
1KI.7.30	And every base had four brasen wheels, and axles of brass: and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each. 
1KI.7.31	And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their borders were foursquare, not round. 
1KI.7.32	And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. 
1KI.7.33	And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten. 
1KI.7.34	And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself. 
1KI.7.35	And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. 
1KI.7.36	And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm tress, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about. 
1KI.7.37	After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form. 
1KI.7.38	And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
1KI.7.39	And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. 
1KI.7.40	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars; 
1KI.7.42	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 
1KI.7.43	and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; 
1KI.7.44	and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; 
1KI.7.45	and the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of the 
1KI.7.46	In the Plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	And Solomon left all the vessels 
1KI.7.48	And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the 
1KI.7.49	and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 
1KI.7.50	and the cups, and the snuffers, and basons, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, 
1KI.7.51	Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of the 
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' 
1KI.8.2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
1KI.8.4	And they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
1KI.8.6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 
1KI.8.8	And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are, unto this day. 
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the 
1KI.8.10	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the 
1KI.8.11	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the 
1KI.8.12	Then spake Solomon, The 
1KI.8.13	I have surely built thee an house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever. 
1KI.8.14	And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. 
1KI.8.15	And he said, Blessed be the 
1KI.8.16	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
1KI.8.17	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. 
1KI.8.20	And the 
1KI.8.21	And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the 
1KI.8.22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	and he said, O 
1KI.8.24	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. 
1KI.8.25	Now therefore, O 
1KI.8.26	Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 
1KI.8.27	But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded! 
1KI.8.28	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O 
1KI.8.29	that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there: to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place; and when thou hearest, forgive. 
1KI.8.31	If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come 
1KI.8.32	then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. 
1KI.8.33	When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house: 
1KI.8.34	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers; 
1KI.8.35	When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them: 
1KI.8.36	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 
1KI.8.37	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting 
1KI.8.38	what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, 
1KI.8.39	then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) 
1KI.8.40	that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 
1KI.8.41	Moreover concerning the stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake; 
1KI.8.42	(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; 
1KI.8.43	hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name. 
1KI.8.44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the 
1KI.8.45	then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 
1KI.8.46	If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near; 
1KI.8.47	yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly; 
1KI.8.48	if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, which carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 
1KI.8.49	then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause; 
1KI.8.50	and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: 
1KI.8.51	For they be thy people, and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: 
1KI.8.52	that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee. 
1KI.8.53	For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord 
1KI.8.54	And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the 
1KI.8.55	And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
1KI.8.56	Blessed be the 
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgements, which he commanded our fathers. 
1KI.8.59	And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart therefore be perfect with the 
1KI.8.62	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the 
1KI.8.63	And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the 
1KI.8.64	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before the 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the 
1KI.9.1	And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the 
1KI.9.2	that the 
1KI.9.3	And the 
1KI.9.4	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgements; 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 
1KI.9.6	But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them: 
1KI.9.7	then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples: 
1KI.9.8	And though this house be so high, yet shall every one that passeth by be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the 
1KI.9.9	and they shall answer, Because they forsook the 
1KI.9.10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the 
1KI.9.11	(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 
1KI.9.12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. 
1KI.9.13	And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul, unto this day. 
1KI.9.14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the 
1KI.9.16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon's wife. 
1KI.9.17	Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 
1KI.9.18	and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land, 
1KI.9.19	and all the store cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
1KI.9.20	As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel; 
1KI.9.21	their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. 
1KI.9.22	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants: but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. 
1KI.9.23	These were the chief officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. 
1KI.9.24	But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which 
1KI.9.25	And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the 
1KI.9.26	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
1KI.9.28	And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
1KI.10.1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the 
1KI.10.2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
1KI.10.3	And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not. 
1KI.10.4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the 
1KI.10.6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. 
1KI.10.8	Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, 
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 
1KI.10.11	And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones. 
1KI.10.12	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the 
1KI.10.13	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	beside 
1KI.10.16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred 
1KI.10.17	And 
1KI.10.18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. 
1KI.10.19	There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays. 
1KI.10.20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 
1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
1KI.10.23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
1KI.10.26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. 
1KI.10.28	And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price. 
1KI.10.29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred 
1KI.11.1	Now king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 
1KI.11.2	of the nations concerning which the 
1KI.11.3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
1KI.11.4	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.11.7	Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	And so did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
1KI.11.9	And the 
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the 
1KI.11.11	Wherefore the 
1KI.11.12	Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
1KI.11.13	Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
1KI.11.14	And the 
1KI.11.15	For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom; 
1KI.11.16	(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom;) 
1KI.11.17	that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child. 
1KI.11.18	And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, 
1KI.11.20	And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh. 
1KI.11.21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me depart in any wise. 
1KI.11.23	And God raised up 
1KI.11.24	And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them 
1KI.11.25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad 
1KI.11.26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, he also lifted up his hand against the king. 
1KI.11.27	And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father. 
1KI.11.28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph. 
1KI.11.29	And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now 
1KI.11.30	And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the 
1KI.11.32	(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) 
1KI.11.33	because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and 
1KI.11.34	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 
1KI.11.35	but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. 
1KI.11.37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. 
1KI.11.39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for over. 
1KI.11.40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam: but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1KI.11.41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.12.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was yet in Egypt, wither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt, 
1KI.12.3	and they sent and called him;) that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 
1KI.12.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 
1KI.12.5	And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed. 
1KI.12.6	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people? 
1KI.12.7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
1KI.12.8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. 
1KI.12.9	And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter? 
1KI.12.10	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. 
1KI.12.11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
1KI.12.13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him; 
1KI.12.14	and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions; 
1KI.12.15	So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of the 
1KI.12.16	And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. 
1KI.12.17	But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
1KI.12.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the levy; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this day. 
1KI.12.20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. 
1KI.12.21	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying, 
1KI.12.24	Thus saith the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: 
1KI.12.27	if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the 
1KI.12.28	Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
1KI.12.29	And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	And this thing became a sin: for the people went 
1KI.12.31	And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made. 
1KI.12.33	And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to burn incense.
1KI.13.1	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the 
1KI.13.2	And he cried against the altar by the word of the 
1KI.13.3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the 
1KI.13.4	And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favour of the 
1KI.13.7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
1KI.13.8	And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 
1KI.13.9	for so was it charged me by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
1KI.13.11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father. 
1KI.13.12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
1KI.13.13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon. 
1KI.13.14	And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am. 
1KI.13.15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
1KI.13.16	And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
1KI.13.17	for it was said to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. 
1KI.13.20	And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.13.22	but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
1KI.13.23	And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, 
1KI.13.24	And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the carcase. 
1KI.13.25	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
1KI.13.26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of the 
1KI.13.27	And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it. 
1KI.13.28	And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. 
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, 
1KI.13.31	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the saying which he cried by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places. 
1KI.13.34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
1KI.14.2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam: and get thee to Shiloh; behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which spake concerning me that I should be king over this people. 
1KI.14.3	And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. 
1KI.14.4	And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
1KI.14.5	And the 
1KI.14.6	And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the 
1KI.14.8	and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; 
1KI.14.9	but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
1KI.14.10	therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone. 
1KI.14.11	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the 
1KI.14.12	Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine house: 
1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave: because in him there is found some good thing toward the 
1KI.14.14	Moreover the 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin. 
1KI.14.17	And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: 
1KI.14.18	And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him; according to the word of the 
1KI.14.19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.14.21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah, Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
1KI.14.22	And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree; 
1KI.14.24	and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the 
1KI.14.25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: o 
1KI.14.26	and he took away the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.14.27	And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. 
1KI.14.28	And it was so, that as oft as the king went into the house of the 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless for David's sake did the 
1KI.15.5	because David did that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.6	Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
1KI.15.7	And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.15.8	And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.9	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. 
1KI.15.10	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.11	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.12	And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the 
1KI.15.15	And he brought into the house of the 
1KI.15.16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.15.19	 a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. 
1KI.15.20	And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
1KI.15.23	Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.25	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.15.27	And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. 
1KI.15.28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 
1KI.15.29	And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of the 
1KI.15.30	for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin; because of his provocation wherewith he provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the hook of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.15.32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, 
1KI.15.34	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.1	And the word of the 
1KI.16.2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
1KI.16.3	behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. 
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.6	And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 
1KI.16.7	And moreover by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, 
1KI.16.9	And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him: now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, which was over the household in Tirzah: 
1KI.16.10	and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 
1KI.16.11	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. 
1KI.16.12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
1KI.16.16	And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died, 
1KI.16.19	for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.21	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, 
1KI.16.24	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria. 
1KI.16.25	And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.29	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
1KI.16.30	And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.31	And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. 
1KI.16.32	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub; according to the word of the 
1KI.17.1	And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the 
1KI.17.2	And the word of the 
1KI.17.3	Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according unto the word of the 
1KI.17.6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
1KI.17.7	And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	And the word of the 
1KI.17.9	Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. 
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow woman was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
1KI.17.12	And she said, As the 
1KI.17.13	And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son. 
1KI.17.14	For thus saith the 
1KI.17.15	And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat 
1KI.17.16	The barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son! 
1KI.17.19	And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	And he cried unto the 
1KI.17.21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the 
1KI.17.22	And the 
1KI.17.23	And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 
1KI.17.24	And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the 
1KI.18.1	And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the 
1KI.18.2	And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	And Ahab called Obadiah, which was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the 
1KI.18.4	for it was so, when Jezebel cut off prophets of the 
1KI.18.5	And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 
1KI.18.7	And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah? 
1KI.18.8	And he answered him, It is I: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah 
1KI.18.9	And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 
1KI.18.10	As the 
1KI.18.11	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah 
1KI.18.12	And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah: 
1KI.18.15	And Elijah said, As the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel? 
1KI.18.18	And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
1KI.18.21	And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the 
1KI.18.22	Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under. 
1KI.18.24	And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.25	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under. 
1KI.18.26	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made. 
1KI.18.27	And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. 
1KI.18.28	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. 
1KI.18.29	And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the 
1KI.18.30	And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood. 
1KI.18.34	And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time. 
1KI.18.35	And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. 
1KI.18.36	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the 
1KI.18.37	Hear me, O 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the 
1KI.18.39	And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The 
1KI.18.40	and Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
1KI.18.41	And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain. 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. 
1KI.18.44	And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Make ready 
1KI.18.45	And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel, 
1KI.18.46	and the hand of the 
1KI.19.1	And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. 
1KI.19.3	And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. 
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O 
1KI.19.5	And he lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. 
1KI.19.6	And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. 
1KI.19.7	And the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
1KI.19.9	And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the 
1KI.19.10	And he said, I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.11	And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the 
1KI.19.12	and after the earthquake a fire; but the 
1KI.19.13	And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
1KI.19.14	And he said, I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.15	And the 
1KI.19.16	and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. 
1KI.19.17	And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay; 
1KI.19.18	Yet will I leave 
1KI.19.19	So he departed thence, and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke 
1KI.19.20	And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee? 
1KI.19.21	And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
1KI.20.1	And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. 
1KI.20.2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad, 
1KI.20.3	Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine. 
1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have. 
1KI.20.5	And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
1KI.20.6	but I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away. 
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not. 
1KI.20.8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken thou not, neither consent. 
1KI.20.9	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again. 
1KI.20.10	And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. 
1KI.20.11	And the king of Israel answered and said, tell him, Let not him that girdeth on 
1KI.20.12	And it came to pass, when 
1KI.20.13	And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.14	And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.15	Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. 
1KI.20.16	And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. 
1KI.20.17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria. 
1KI.20.18	And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. 
1KI.20.19	So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. 
1KI.20.20	And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. 
1KI.20.23	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. 
1KI.20.24	And do this thing; take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room: 
1KI.20.25	and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. 
1KI.20.26	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. 
1KI.20.28	And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.29	And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. 
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
1KI.20.31	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and 
1KI.20.33	Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
1KI.20.34	And 
1KI.20.35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the 
1KI.20.36	Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him. 
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 
1KI.20.40	And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgement be; thyself hast decided it. 
1KI.20.41	And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	And he said unto him, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.43	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. 
1KI.21.3	And Naboth said to Ahab, The 
1KI.21.4	And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
1KI.21.5	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
1KI.21.6	And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee 
1KI.21.7	And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, 
1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: 
1KI.21.10	and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he die. 
1KI.21.11	And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
1KI.21.13	And the two men, sons of Belial, came in and sat before him: and the men of Belial bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. 
1KI.21.15	And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
1KI.21.16	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	And the word of the 
1KI.21.18	Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.21.20	And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of the 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away, and will cut off from Ahab every man child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel: 
1KI.21.22	and I will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin. 
1KI.21.23	And of Jezebel also spake the 
1KI.21.24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. 
1KI.21.25	(But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.21.26	And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the 
1KI.21.27	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
1KI.21.28	And the word of the 
1KI.21.29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
1KI.22.1	And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
1KI.22.4	And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
1KI.22.5	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here besides a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the 
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah. 
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 
1KI.22.11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the 
1KI.22.13	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets 
1KI.22.14	And Micaiah said, As the 
1KI.22.15	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up, and prosper; and the 
1KI.22.16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? 
1KI.22.19	And he said, Therefore hear thou the word of the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	And the 
1KI.22.23	Now therefore, behold, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the 
1KI.22.25	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
1KI.22.26	And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
1KI.22.27	and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. 
1KI.22.28	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 
1KI.22.34	And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded. 
1KI.22.35	And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country. 
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; (now the harlots washed themselves 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.41	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.22.44	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. 
1KI.22.47	And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. 
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
1KI.22.49	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. 
1KI.22.50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.52	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.22.53	And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the 
2KI.1.1	And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
2KI.1.2	And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this sickness. 
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore thus saith the 
2KI.1.5	And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned? 
2KI.1.6	And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.1.7	And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words? 
2KI.1.8	And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
2KI.1.9	Then 
2KI.1.10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 
2KI.1.11	And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. 
2KI.1.12	And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 
2KI.1.13	And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. 
2KI.1.14	Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties: but now let my life be precious in thy sight. 
2KI.1.15	And the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	And he said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.1.17	So he died according to the word of the 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	And it came to pass, when the 
2KI.2.2	And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.3	And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
2KI.2.4	And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.5	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
2KI.2.6	And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote me waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. 
2KI.2.10	And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: 
2KI.2.11	And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, 
2KI.2.12	And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
2KI.2.13	He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the 
2KI.2.15	And when the sons of the prophets which were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the spirit of the 
2KI.2.17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. 
2KI.2.18	And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
2KI.2.19	And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the land miscarrieth. 
2KI.2.20	And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith the 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake. 
2KI.2.23	And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. 
2KI.2.24	And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. 
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of an hundred thousand lambs, and of an hundred thousand rams. 
2KI.3.5	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2KI.3.6	And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
2KI.3.8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom. 
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	And the king of Israel said, Alas! for the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the 
2KI.3.12	And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the 
2KI.3.13	And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the 
2KI.3.14	And Elisha said, As the 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the 
2KI.3.16	And he said, Thus saith the 
2KI.3.17	For thus saith the 
2KI.3.18	And this is but a light thing in the sight of the 
2KI.3.19	And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
2KI.3.20	And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. 
2KI.3.21	Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood on the border. 
2KI.3.22	And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood: 
2KI.3.23	and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. 
2KI.3.24	And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees: until in Kir-hareseth 
2KI.3.26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom: but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead: and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the 
2KI.4.2	And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. 
2KI.4.4	And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full. 
2KI.4.5	So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought 
2KI.4.6	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. 
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.
2KI.4.8	And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. 
2KI.4.9	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 
2KI.4.10	Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. 
2KI.4.11	And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there. 
2KI.4.12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 
2KI.4.14	And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old. 
2KI.4.15	And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 
2KI.4.16	And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. 
2KI.4.17	And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.
2KI.4.18	And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother. 
2KI.4.20	And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. 
2KI.4.21	And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut 
2KI.4.22	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. 
2KI.4.23	And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well. 
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee. 
2KI.4.25	So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite: 
2KI.4.26	run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. 
2KI.4.27	And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and the 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? 
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 
2KI.4.30	And the mother of the child said, As the 
2KI.4.31	And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked. 
2KI.4.32	And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. 
2KI.4.33	He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the 
2KI.4.34	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. 
2KI.4.35	Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in onto him, he said, Take up thy son. 
2KI.4.37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.
2KI.4.38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. 
2KI.4.39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. 
2KI.4.40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. 
2KI.4.41	But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. 
2KI.4.42	And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. 
2KI.4.43	And his servant said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith the 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the 
2KI.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. 
2KI.5.3	And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy. 
2KI.5.4	And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. 
2KI.5.5	And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand 
2KI.5.6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. 
2KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. 
2KI.5.8	And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 
2KI.5.10	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. 
2KI.5.13	And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? 
2KI.5.14	Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant. 
2KI.5.16	But he said, As the 
2KI.5.17	And Naaman said, If not, yet I pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the 
2KI.5.18	In this thing the 
2KI.5.19	And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? 
2KI.5.22	And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment. 
2KI.5.23	And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. 
2KI.5.24	And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. 
2KI.5.25	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. 
2KI.5.26	And he said unto him, Went not mine heart 
2KI.5.27	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper 
2KI.6.1	And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us. 
2KI.6.2	Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. 
2KI.6.3	And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go. 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. 
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed. 
2KI.6.6	And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim. 
2KI.6.7	And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.
2KI.6.8	Now the king of Syria warred against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. 
2KI.6.9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down. 
2KI.6.10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice. 
2KI.6.11	And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel? 
2KI.6.12	And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
2KI.6.13	And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. 
2KI.6.14	Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. 
2KI.6.15	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? 
2KI.6.16	And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. 
2KI.6.17	And Elisha prayed, and said, 
2KI.6.18	And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the 
2KI.6.19	And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria. 
2KI.6.20	And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, 
2KI.6.21	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father; shall I smite them? shall I smite them? 
2KI.6.22	And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. 
2KI.6.23	And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore 
2KI.6.26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 
2KI.6.27	And he said, If the 
2KI.6.28	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow. 
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son. 
2KI.6.30	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; (now he was passing by upon the wall;) and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 
2KI.6.32	But Elisha sat in his house; and the elders sat with him; and 
2KI.6.33	And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the 
2KI.7.1	And Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the 
2KI.7.2	Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the 
2KI.7.3	Now there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 
2KI.7.4	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. 
2KI.7.5	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there. 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 
2KI.7.7	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. 
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it. 
2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us: now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household. 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were. 
2KI.7.11	And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within.
2KI.7.12	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city. 
2KI.7.13	And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed:) and let us send and see. 
2KI.7.14	They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 
2KI.7.15	And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. 
2KI.7.16	And the people went out, and spoiled the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was 
2KI.7.17	And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria; 
2KI.7.19	and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the 
2KI.7.20	it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the 
2KI.8.2	And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
2KI.8.3	And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 
2KI.8.4	Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. 
2KI.8.5	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life. 
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
2KI.8.7	And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. 
2KI.8.8	And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go meet the man of God, and inquire of the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness. 
2KI.8.10	And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit the 
2KI.8.11	And he settled his countenance stedfastly 
2KI.8.12	And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child. 
2KI.8.13	And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, which is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The 
2KI.8.14	Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover. 
2KI.8.15	And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, So that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.17	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.19	Howbeit the 
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 
2KI.8.21	Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.2	And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.5	And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 
2KI.9.6	And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab every man child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel. 
2KI.9.9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was. 
2KI.9.12	And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.13	Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king. 
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria: 
2KI.9.15	but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. 
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace? 
2KI.9.18	So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. 
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. 
2KI.9.20	And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. 
2KI.9.21	And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2KI.9.22	And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many? 
2KI.9.23	And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. 
2KI.9.24	And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then said 
2KI.9.26	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the 
2KI.9.27	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. An Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: 
2KI.9.28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. 
2KI.9.29	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
2KI.9.30	And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and tired her head, and looked out at the window. 
2KI.9.31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master's murderer? 
2KI.9.32	And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. 
2KI.9.33	And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot. 
2KI.9.34	And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter. 
2KI.9.35	And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the 
2KI.9.37	and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
2KI.10.1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up 
2KI.10.2	And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; 
2KI.10.3	look ye out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. 
2KI.10.4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? 
2KI.10.5	And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up 
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up. 
2KI.10.7	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
2KI.10.9	And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who smote all these? 
2KI.10.10	Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. 
2KI.10.12	And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house of the shepherds in the way, 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen. 
2KI.10.14	And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
2KI.10.15	And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of the 
2KI.10.18	And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much. 
2KI.10.19	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice 
2KI.10.20	And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another. 
2KI.10.22	And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments. 
2KI.10.23	And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the 
2KI.10.24	And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, 
2KI.10.25	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made as end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. 
2KI.10.26	And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them. 
2KI.10.27	And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house, unto this day. 
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2KI.10.29	Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, 
2KI.10.30	And the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	from Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.10.36	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
2KI.11.1	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, 
2KI.11.3	And he was with her hid in the house of the 
2KI.11.4	And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds, of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the 
2KI.11.5	And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house; 
2KI.11.6	And a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier. 
2KI.11.7	And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of the 
2KI.11.8	And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in. 
2KI.11.9	And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David's, which were in the house of the 
2KI.11.11	And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about. 
2KI.11.12	Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and 
2KI.11.13	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard 
2KI.11.14	and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason. 
2KI.11.15	And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword: for the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the 
2KI.11.16	So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house: and there was she slain.
2KI.11.17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down: his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the 
2KI.11.19	And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the 
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword at the king's house. 
2KI.11.21	Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
2KI.12.2	And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.12.3	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2KI.12.4	And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.5	let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance: and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. 
2KI.12.6	But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 
2KI.12.7	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the 
2KI.12.8	And the priests consented that they should take no 
2KI.12.9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the 
2KI.12.10	And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the 
2KI.12.11	And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the 
2KI.12.13	But there were not made for the house of the 
2KI.12.14	for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of the 
2KI.12.15	Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work: for they dealt faithfully. 
2KI.12.16	The money for the guilt offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.12.19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, 
2KI.12.21	For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in hin stead.
2KI.13.1	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.13.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.3	And the anger of the 
2KI.13.4	And Jehoahaz besought the 
2KI.13.5	(And the 
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.) 
2KI.13.7	For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing. 
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

2KI.13.13	And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 
2KI.13.14	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! 
2KI.13.15	And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows: and he took unto him bow and arrows. 
2KI.13.16	And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow: and he put his hand 
2KI.13.17	And he said, Open the window eastward: and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot: and he shot. And he said, The 
2KI.13.18	And he said, Take the arrows: and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground: and he smote thrice, and stayed. 
2KI.13.19	And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
2KI.13.20	And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the hands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
2KI.13.21	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. 
2KI.13.22	And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	And Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.13.25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him; and recovered the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign. 
2KI.14.2	He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.14.4	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 
2KI.14.5	And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father: 
2KI.14.6	but the children of the murderers he put not to death: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the 
2KI.14.7	He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 
2KI.14.9	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. 
2KI.14.10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to 
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 
2KI.14.12	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. 
2KI.14.13	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubists. 
2KI.14.14	And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the

2KI.14.19	And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 
2KI.14.20	And they brought him upon horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
2KI.14.21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.

2KI.16.16	Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
2KI.16.17	And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone. 
2KI.16.18	And the covered way for the sabbath, that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he unto the house of the 
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, 
2KI.17.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him presents. 
2KI.17.4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor, 
2KI.17.7	And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom the 
2KI.17.9	And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against the 
2KI.17.10	and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree: 
2KI.17.11	and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom the 
2KI.17.12	and they served idols, whereof the 
2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in the 
2KI.17.15	And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified unto them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and 
2KI.17.16	And they forsook all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.18	Therefore the 
2KI.17.19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the 
2KI.17.20	And the 
2KI.17.21	For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the 
2KI.17.22	And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. 
2KI.17.25	And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the 
2KI.17.26	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 
2KI.17.30	And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	So they feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the 
2KI.17.35	with whom the 
2KI.17.36	but the 
2KI.17.37	and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods: 
2KI.17.38	and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods: 
2KI.17.39	but the 
2KI.17.40	Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. 
2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the 
2KI.18.1	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.18.2	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: And he brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan. 
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	For he clave to the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
2KI.18.9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. 
2KI.18.10	And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 
2KI.18.11	And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and in Habor, 
2KI.18.12	because they obeyed not the voice of the 
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. 
2KI.18.14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	And Hezekiah gave 
2KI.18.16	At that time did Hezekiah cut off 
2KI.18.17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field. 
2KI.18.18	And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. 
2KI.18.19	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? 
2KI.18.20	Thou sayest, but they are but vain words, 
2KI.18.21	Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. 
2KI.18.22	But if ye say unto me, We trust in the 
2KI.18.23	Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
2KI.18.24	How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	Am I now come up without the 
2KI.18.26	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. 
2KI.18.27	But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? 
2KI.18.28	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.29	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand: 
2KI.18.30	neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
2KI.18.31	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 
2KI.18.32	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The 
2KI.18.33	Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the 
2KI.18.36	But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
2KI.18.37	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah, with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
2KI.19.1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 
2KI.19.4	It may be the 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
2KI.19.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
2KI.19.8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Edom which were in Telassar? 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? 
2KI.19.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	Incline thine ear, O 
2KI.19.17	Of a truth, 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	Now therefore, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the 
2KI.19.22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? 
2KI.19.23	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field. 
2KI.19.24	I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt. 
2KI.19.25	Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. 
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. 
2KI.19.27	But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me. 
2KI.19.28	Because of thy raging against me, and for that thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 
2KI.19.29	And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 
2KI.19.30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of the 
2KI.19.32	Therefore thus saith the 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the 
2KI.19.34	For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
2KI.19.35	And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.20.1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the 
2KI.20.3	Remember now, O 
2KI.20.4	And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of the 
2KI.20.5	Turn again, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 
2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. 
2KI.20.8	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the 
2KI.20.9	And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from the 
2KI.20.10	And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps. 
2KI.20.11	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah shewed them not. 
2KI.20.14	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon. 
2KI.20.15	And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. 
2KI.20.16	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the 
2KI.20.18	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
2KI.20.19	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the 
2KI.20.20	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hephzi-bah. 
2KI.21.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
2KI.21.4	And he built altars in the house of the 
2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.21.6	And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.7	And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which the 
2KI.21.8	neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. 
2KI.21.9	But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations, whom the 
2KI.21.10	And the 
2KI.21.11	Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 
2KI.21.12	therefore thus saith the 
2KI.21.13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 
2KI.21.15	because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. 
2KI.21.16	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 
2KI.21.22	and he forsook the 
2KI.21.23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house. 
2KI.21.24	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.22.3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the 
2KI.22.4	Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of the 
2KI.22.5	and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.6	unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons; and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 
2KI.22.7	Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully. 
2KI.22.8	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2KI.22.9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.10	And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2KI.22.11	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying, 
2KI.22.13	Go ye, inquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they communed with her. 
2KI.22.15	And she said unto them, Thus saith the 
2KI.22.16	Thus saith the 
2KI.22.17	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched. 
2KI.22.18	But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2KI.22.19	because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before the 
2KI.22.20	Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
2KI.23.1	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	And the king went up to the house of the 
2KI.23.3	And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before the 
2KI.23.4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the 
2KI.23.5	And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. 
2KI.23.6	And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the 
2KI.23.7	And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of the 
2KI.23.8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 
2KI.23.11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the 
2KI.23.12	And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.23.13	And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. 
2KI.23.14	And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men. 
2KI.23.15	Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and stamped it small to powder, and burned the Asherah. 
2KI.23.16	And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el. 
2KI.23.18	And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke 
2KI.23.20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.21	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the 
2KI.23.22	Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 
2KI.23.23	but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to the 
2KI.23.24	Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the 
2KI.23.25	And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Notwithstanding the 
2KI.23.27	And the 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
2KI.23.30	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.23.33	And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 
2KI.23.34	And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there. 
2KI.23.35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh. 
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. 
2KI.24.2	And the 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the commandment of the 
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.24.7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 
2KI.24.11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it; 
2KI.24.12	and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 
2KI.24.13	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.24.14	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
2KI.24.15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 
2KI.24.17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.20	For through the anger of the 
2KI.25.1	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. 
2KI.25.2	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.3	On the ninth day of the 
2KI.25.4	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war 
2KI.25.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgement upon him. 
2KI.25.7	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: 
2KI.25.9	And he burnt the house of the 
2KI.25.10	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were 
2KI.25.11	And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. 
2KI.25.13	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the 
2KI.25.14	And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 
2KI.25.15	And the firepans, and the basons; that which was of gold, in gold; and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. 
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of the 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a chapiter of brass was upon it: and the height of the chapiter was three cubits; with network and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network. 
2KI.25.18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
2KI.25.19	and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king's face, which were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, which mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
2KI.25.22	And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor. 
2KI.25.23	Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 
2KI.25.24	And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 
2KI.25.25	But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. 
2KI.25.27	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 
2KI.25.28	and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, 
2KI.25.29	and he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life, 
2KI.25.30	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.

1CH.8.27	and Jaareshiah, and Elijah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham. 
1CH.8.28	These were heads of fathers' 
1CH.8.29	And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of Gibeon, 
1CH.8.30	and his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab; 
1CH.8.31	and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zecher. 
1CH.8.32	And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And they also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against their brethren.
1CH.8.33	And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 
1CH.8.34	And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal begat Micah. 
1CH.8.35	And the sons of Micah; Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz. 
1CH.8.36	And Ahaz begat Jehoaddah; and Jehoaddah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza: 
1CH.8.37	And Moza begat Binea; Raphah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son: 
1CH.8.38	And Azel had six sons, whose names are these; Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel. 
1CH.8.39	And the sons of Eshek his brother; Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third. 
1CH.8.40	And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty. All these were of the sons of Benjamin.
1CH.9.1	So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel: and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their transgression. 
1CH.9.2	Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim. 
1CH.9.3	And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh; 
1CH.9.4	Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah.

1CH.9.13	and their brethren, heads of their fathers' houses, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.
1CH.9.14	And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 
1CH.9.15	and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

1CH.9.17	And the porters; Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief; 
1CH.9.18	who hitherto 
1CH.9.19	And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of his father's house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers had been over the camp of the 
1CH.9.20	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, 
1CH.9.21	Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tent of meeting. 
1CH.9.22	All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office. 
1CH.9.23	So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the 
1CH.9.24	On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
1CH.9.25	And their brethren, and their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them: 
1CH.9.26	for the four chief porters, who were Levites, were in a set office, and were over the chambers and over the treasuries in the house of God. 
1CH.9.27	And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge 
1CH.9.28	And certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by tale were they brought in and by tale were they taken out. 
1CH.9.29	Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices: 
1CH.9.30	And some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices. 
1CH.9.31	And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were baked in pans. 
1CH.9.32	And some of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath. 
1CH.9.33	And these are the singers, heads of fathers' 
1CH.9.34	These were heads of fathers' 
1CH.9.35	And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's name was Maacah: 
1CH.9.36	and his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab; 
1CH.9.37	and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
1CH.9.38	And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against their brethren. 
1CH.9.39	And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 
1CH.9.40	And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal begat Micah. 
1CH.9.41	And the sons of Micah; Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, 
1CH.9.42	And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza: 
1CH.9.43	and Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son: 
1CH.9.44	And Azel had six sons, whose names are these; Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.
1CH.10.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 
1CH.10.2	And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. 
1CH.10.3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers. 
1CH.10.4	Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith: lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it. 
1CH.10.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died. 
1CH.10.6	So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together. 
1CH.10.7	And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1CH.10.8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 
1CH.10.9	And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people. 
1CH.10.10	And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. 
1CH.10.11	And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1CH.10.12	all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
1CH.10.13	So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against the 
1CH.10.14	and inquired not of the 
1CH.11.1	Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
1CH.11.2	In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the 
1CH.11.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the 
1CH.11.4	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 
1CH.11.5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 
1CH.11.6	And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. 
1CH.11.7	And David dwelt in the strong hold; therefore they called it the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
1CH.11.9	And David waxed greater and greater; for the 
1CH.11.10	Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who shewed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the 
1CH.11.11	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time. 
1CH.11.12	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. 
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
1CH.11.14	And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the 
1CH.11.15	And three of the thirty chief went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	And David was then in the hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. 
1CH.11.17	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate! 
1CH.11.18	And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the 
1CH.11.19	and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with 
1CH.11.20	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. 
1CH.11.21	Of the three, he was more honourable than the two and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the 
1CH.11.22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two 
1CH.11.23	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
1CH.11.24	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. 
1CH.11.25	Behold, he was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the 
1CH.11.26	Also the mighty men of the armies; Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; 
1CH.11.27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite; 
1CH.11.28	Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite; 
1CH.11.29	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite; 
1CH.11.30	Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite; 
1CH.11.31	Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite; 
1CH.11.32	Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite; 
1CH.11.33	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite; 
1CH.11.34	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite; 
1CH.11.35	Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur; 
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite; 
1CH.11.37	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai; 
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri; 
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah; 
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; 
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai; 
1CH.11.42	Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him; 
1CH.11.43	Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite; 
1CH.11.44	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite; 
1CH.11.45	Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite; 
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 
1CH.11.47	Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
1CH.12.1	Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war. 
1CH.12.2	They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow; they were of Saul's brethren of Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite; 
1CH.12.4	and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite; 
1CH.12.5	Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; 
1CH.12.7	and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
1CH.12.8	And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David to the hold in the wilderness, mighty men of valour, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 
1CH.12.9	Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third; 
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah the fourth; Jeremiah the fifth; 
1CH.12.11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh; 
1CH.12.12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth; 
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. 
1CH.12.14	These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host: he that was least was equal to an hundred, and the greatest to a thousand. 
1CH.12.15	These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west. 
1CH.12.16	And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David. 
1CH.12.17	And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if 
1CH.12.18	Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, 
1CH.12.19	Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads. 
1CH.12.20	As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	And they helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host. 
1CH.12.22	For from day to day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.
1CH.12.23	And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, which came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the 
1CH.12.24	The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war. 
1CH.12.25	Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. 
1CH.12.26	Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 
1CH.12.27	And Jehoiada was the leader of 
1CH.12.28	and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains. 
1CH.12.29	And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. 
1CH.12.30	And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous men in their fathers' houses. 
1CH.12.31	And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king. 
1CH.12.32	And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment. 
1CH.12.33	Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand; and that could order 
1CH.12.34	And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 
1CH.12.35	And of the Danites that could set the battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 
1CH.12.36	And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand. 
1CH.12.37	And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand. 
1CH.12.38	All these, being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had made preparation for them. 
1CH.12.40	Moreover they that were nigh unto them, 
1CH.13.1	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. 
1CH.13.2	And David said unto, all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of the 
1CH.13.3	and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul. 
1CH.13.4	And all the assembly said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel together, from Shihor 
1CH.13.6	And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, 
1CH.13.7	And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, 
1CH.13.8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might: even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
1CH.13.9	And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	And the anger of the 
1CH.13.11	And David was displeased, because the 
1CH.13.12	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? 
1CH.13.13	So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and the 
1CH.14.1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him an house. 
1CH.14.2	And David perceived that the 
1CH.14.3	And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	And these are the names of the children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon; 
1CH.14.5	and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet; 
1CH.14.6	and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia; 
1CH.14.7	and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the 
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by mine hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 
1CH.14.12	And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. 
1CH.14.13	And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. 
1CH.14.14	And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 
1CH.14.15	And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines; 
1CH.14.16	And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	And the fame of David went out unto all lands; and the 
1CH.15.1	And 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the 
1CH.15.3	And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.4	And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: 
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 
1CH.15.8	of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 
1CH.15.9	of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. 
1CH.15.11	And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
1CH.15.12	and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers' 
1CH.15.13	For because ye 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the 
1CH.15.16	And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy. 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
1CH.15.18	and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. 
1CH.15.19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, 
1CH.15.20	and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth; 
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead. 
1CH.15.22	And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful. 
1CH.15.23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.26	And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.1	And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion 
1CH.16.4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 
1CH.16.6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.8	O give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.9	Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; talk ye of all his marvelous works. 
1CH.16.10	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek ye the 
1CH.16.12	Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth; 
1CH.16.13	O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.15	Remember his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; 
1CH.16.16	 which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 
1CH.16.17	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 
1CH.16.18	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 
1CH.16.19	When ye were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and sojourners in it; 
1CH.16.20	And they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people. 
1CH.16.21	He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 
1CH.16.22	, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm. 
1CH.16.23	Sing unto the 
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 
1CH.16.25	For great is the 
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols: but the 
1CH.16.27	Honour and majesty are before him: strength and gladness are in his place. 
1CH.16.28	Give unto the 
1CH.16.29	Give unto the 
1CH.16.30	Tremble before him, all the earth: the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved. 
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; and let them say among the nations, The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar and the fulness thereof; let the field exult, and all that is therein; 
1CH.16.33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before the 
1CH.16.34	O give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.35	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the 
1CH.16.37	So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.38	and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers: 
1CH.16.39	and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings unto the 
1CH.16.41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	and with them Heman and Jeduthun 
1CH.16.43	And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
1CH.17.1	And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.17.2	And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee. 
1CH.17.3	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the 
1CH.17.5	for I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from 
1CH.17.6	In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedar? 
1CH.17.7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the 
1CH.17.8	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. 
1CH.17.9	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, 
1CH.17.10	and 
1CH.17.11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: 
1CH.17.14	but I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for ever. 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1CH.17.16	Then David the king went in, and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O 
1CH.17.18	What can David 
1CH.17.19	O 
1CH.17.20	O 
1CH.17.21	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, which thou redeemedst out of Egypt? 
1CH.17.22	For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, 
1CH.17.23	And now, O 
1CH.17.24	And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, The 
1CH.17.25	For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore hath thy servant found 
1CH.17.26	And now, O 
1CH.17.27	and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O 
1CH.18.1	And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
1CH.18.2	And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. 
1CH.18.3	And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
1CH.18.4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. 
1CH.18.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
1CH.18.6	Then David put 
1CH.18.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1CH.18.9	And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer had wars with Tou; and 
1CH.18.11	These also did king David dedicate unto the 
1CH.18.12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand. 
1CH.18.13	And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the 
1CH.18.14	And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed judgement and justice unto all his people. 
1CH.18.15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder, 
1CH.18.16	and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
1CH.18.17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
1CH.19.1	And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
1CH.19.2	And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
1CH.19.6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cites, and came to battle. 
1CH.19.8	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
1CH.19.9	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
1CH.19.10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
1CH.19.11	And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
1CH.19.12	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 
1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.19.16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head. 
1CH.19.17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him: 
1CH.19.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians 
1CH.19.19	And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
1CH.20.1	And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out 
1CH.20.2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. 
1CH.20.3	And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut 
1CH.20.4	And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant: and they were subdued. 
1CH.20.5	And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
1CH.20.6	And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six 
1CH.20.7	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. 
1CH.20.8	These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. 
1CH.21.2	And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them. 
1CH.21.3	And Joab said, The 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword; 
1CH.21.6	But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
1CH.21.7	And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. 
1CH.21.8	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
1CH.21.9	And the 
1CH.21.10	Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1CH.21.12	either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the 
1CH.21.13	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, the 
1CH.21.16	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O 
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
1CH.21.21	And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto the 
1CH.21.23	And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give 
1CH.21.24	And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the 
1CH.21.25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
1CH.21.26	And David built there an altar unto the 
1CH.21.27	And the 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, This is the house of the 
1CH.22.2	And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 
1CH.22.3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
1CH.22.4	and cedar trees without number: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David. 
1CH.22.5	And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the 
1CH.22.7	And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build an house unto the name of the 
1CH.22.8	But the word of the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days: 
1CH.22.10	he shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, the 
1CH.22.12	Only the 
1CH.22.13	Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the judgements which the 
1CH.22.14	Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are cunning in any manner of work; 
1CH.22.16	of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number; arise and be doing, and the 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, 
1CH.22.18	Is not the 
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek after the 
1CH.23.1	Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
1CH.23.3	And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
1CH.23.4	Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the 
1CH.23.5	and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised the 
1CH.23.6	And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
1CH.23.7	Of the Gershonites; Ladan and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan; Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei; Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' 
1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shimei; Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 
1CH.23.11	And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning. 
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before the 
1CH.23.14	But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses; Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The sons of Gershom; Shebuel the chief. 
1CH.23.17	And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
1CH.23.18	The sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. 
1CH.23.19	The sons of Hebron; Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
1CH.23.20	The sons of Uzziel; Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. 
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari; Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' 
1CH.23.25	For David said, The 
1CH.23.26	and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof. 
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward. 
1CH.23.28	For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the 
1CH.23.29	for the shewbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size; 
1CH.23.30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise the 
1CH.23.31	and to offer all burnt offerings unto the 
1CH.23.32	and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of the 
1CH.24.1	And the courses of the sons of Aaron 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest office. 
1CH.24.3	And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. 
1CH.24.4	And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and 
1CH.24.5	Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
1CH.24.6	And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' 
1CH.24.7	Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah; 
1CH.24.8	the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim; 
1CH.24.9	the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin; 
1CH.24.10	the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah; 
1CH.24.11	the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah; 
1CH.24.12	the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim; 
1CH.24.13	the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab; 
1CH.24.14	the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer; 
1CH.24.15	the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez; 
1CH.24.16	the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel; 
1CH.24.17	the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul; 
1CH.24.18	the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. 
1CH.24.19	This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of the

1CH.24.30	And the sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers' houses. 
1CH.24.31	These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' 
1CH.25.1	Moreover David and the captains of the host separated for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of them that did the work according to their service was:

1CH.26.12	Of these were the courses of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having charges like as their brethren, to minister in the house of the

1CH.26.28	And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brethren.

1CH.26.32	And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred, heads of fathers'

1CH.27.7	The fourth 
1CH.27.8	The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

1CH.27.10	The seventh 
1CH.27.11	The eighth 
1CH.27.12	The ninth 
1CH.27.13	The tenth 
1CH.27.14	The eleventh 
1CH.27.15	The twelfth

1CH.27.17	of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of Aaron, Zadok:

1CH.27.22	of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. 
1CH.27.23	But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the 
1CH.27.24	Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but finished not; and there came wrath for this upon Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David; 
1CH.27.25	And over the king's treasuries was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasuries in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah: 
1CH.27.26	And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 
1CH.27.27	and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:

1CH.27.30	and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 
1CH.27.31	and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's. 
1CH.27.32	Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons: 
1CH.27.33	And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend: 
1CH.27.34	and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's host was Joab.
1CH.28.1	And David assembled all the prices of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that served the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valour, unto Jerusalem. 
1CH.28.2	Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.3	But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood. 
1CH.28.4	Howbeit the 
1CH.28.5	And of all my sons, (for the 
1CH.28.6	And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
1CH.28.7	And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgements, as at this day. 
1CH.28.8	Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the 
1CH.28.9	And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the 
1CH.28.10	Take heed now; for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch 
1CH.28.12	and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, for the courts of the house of the 
1CH.28.13	also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the 
1CH.28.14	of gold by weight for the 
1CH.28.15	by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof, and for the candlesticks of silver, 
1CH.28.16	and the gold by weight for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver: 
1CH.28.17	and the fleshhooks, and the basons, and the cups, of pure gold: and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl: 
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight: and gold for the pattern of the chariot, 
1CH.28.19	All this, 
1CH.28.20	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the 
1CH.28.21	And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
1CH.29.1	And David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the 
1CH.29.2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the 
1CH.29.3	Moreover also, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house; 
1CH.29.4	even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal: 
1CH.29.5	of gold for the 
1CH.29.6	Then the princes of the fathers' 
1CH.29.7	and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents. 
1CH.29.8	And they with whom 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to the 
1CH.29.10	Wherefore David blessed the 
1CH.29.11	Thine, O 
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. 
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
1CH.29.14	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. 
1CH.29.15	For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. 
1CH.29.16	O 
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness, As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee. 
1CH.29.18	O 
1CH.29.19	and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision. 
1CH.29.20	And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the 
1CH.29.21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the 
1CH.29.22	and did eat and drink before the 
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. 
1CH.29.25	And the 
1CH.29.26	Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three 
1CH.29.28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer; 
1CH.29.30	with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.1.1	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the 
2CH.1.2	And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' 
2CH.1.3	So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the 
2CH.1.4	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to 
2CH.1.5	Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the 
2CH.1.7	In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. 
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great kindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead. 
2CH.1.9	Now, O 
2CH.1.10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 
2CH.1.11	And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee; neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
2CH.1.13	So Solomon came 
2CH.1.14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. 
2CH.1.16	And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price. 
2CH.1.17	And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred 
2CH.2.1	Now Solomon purposed to build an house for the name of the 
2CH.2.2	And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. 
2CH.2.3	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, 
2CH.2.4	Behold, I build an house for the name of the 
2CH.2.5	And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods. 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn incense before him? 
2CH.2.7	Now therefore send me a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave 
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 
2CH.2.9	even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great. 
2CH.2.10	And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2CH.2.11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the 
2CH.2.12	Huram said moreover, Blessed be the 
2CH.2.13	And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's, 
2CH.2.14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device: that there may be 
2CH.2.15	Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 
2CH.2.16	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem. 
2CH.2.17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred. 
2CH.2.18	And he set threescore, and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people awork.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the 
2CH.3.2	And he began to build in the second 
2CH.3.3	Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 
2CH.3.4	And the porch that was before 
2CH.3.5	And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm trees and chains: 
2CH.3.6	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls. 
2CH.3.8	And he made the most holy house; the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. 
2CH.3.9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
2CH.3.10	And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one 
2CH.3.12	And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house. 
2CH.3.14	And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon. 
2CH.3.15	Also he made before the house two pillars, of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. 
2CH.3.16	And he made chains in the oracle, and put 
2CH.3.17	And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
2CH.4.1	Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. 
2CH.4.2	Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about. 
2CH.4.3	And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 
2CH.4.4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. 
2CH.4.5	And it was an handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths. 
2CH.4.6	He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them: but the sea was for the priests to wash in. 
2CH.4.7	And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 
2CH.4.8	He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. 
2CH.4.9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. 
2CH.4.10	And he set the sea on the right side 
2CH.4.11	And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God: 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two chapiters which were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars; 
2CH.4.13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars. 
2CH.4.14	He made also the bases, and the layers made he upon the bases; 
2CH.4.15	one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. 
2CH.4.16	The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of the 
2CH.4.17	In the Plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out. 
2CH.4.19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the shewbread; 
2CH.4.20	and the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold; 
2CH.4.21	and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold; 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, 
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.3	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was 
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark, 
2CH.5.5	and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up. 
2CH.5.6	And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
2CH.5.7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above: 
2CH.5.9	And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is, unto this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when the 
2CH.5.11	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses; 
2CH.5.12	also the Levites which were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 
2CH.5.13	it came even to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the 
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	Then spake Solomon, The 
2CH.6.2	But I have built thee an house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever. 
2CH.6.3	And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. 
2CH.6.4	And he said, Blessed be the 
2CH.6.5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel: 
2CH.6.6	but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. 
2CH.6.10	And the 
2CH.6.11	And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of the 
2CH.6.12	And he stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	(for Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:) 
2CH.6.14	and he said, O 
2CH.6.15	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. 
2CH.6.16	Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.17	Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.18	But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded! 
2CH.6.19	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O 
2CH.6.20	that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. 
2CH.6.21	And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive. 
2CH.6.22	If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come 
2CH.6.23	then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. 
2CH.6.24	And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house: 
2CH.6.25	then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. 
2CH.6.26	When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them: 
2CH.6.27	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 
2CH.6.28	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpiller; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be; 
2CH.6.29	what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house: 
2CH.6.30	then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;) 
2CH.6.31	that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 
2CH.6.32	Moreover concerning the stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; when they shall come and pay toward this house: 
2CH.6.33	then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built, is called by thy name. 
2CH.6.34	If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 
2CH.6.35	then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 
2CH.6.36	If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near; 
2CH.6.37	yet if they shall bethink themselves, in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly; 
2CH.6.38	if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: 
2CH.6.39	then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause; and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. 
2CH.6.40	Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place. 
2CH.6.41	Now therefore arise, O 
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.7.1	Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the 
2CH.7.3	And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of the 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the 
2CH.7.5	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
2CH.7.6	And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of the 
2CH.7.7	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
2CH.7.8	So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
2CH.7.10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh mouth he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the 
2CH.7.12	And the 
2CH.7.13	If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 
2CH.7.14	if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place. 
2CH.7.16	For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 
2CH.7.17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgements; 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. 
2CH.7.19	But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them: 
2CH.7.20	then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
2CH.7.21	And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath the 
2CH.7.22	And they shall answer, Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the 
2CH.8.2	that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwelt there. 
2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it. 
2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 
2CH.8.6	and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
2CH.8.7	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel; 
2CH.8.8	of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy 
2CH.8.9	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. 
2CH.8.10	And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people, 
2CH.8.11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the 
2CH.8.13	even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, 
2CH.8.14	And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded. 
2CH.8.15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. 
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the 
2CH.8.17	Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the sea shore in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
2CH.9.1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
2CH.9.2	And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was not any thing hid from Solomon which he told her not. 
2CH.9.3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 
2CH.9.4	and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants; and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the 
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. 
2CH.9.6	Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard. 
2CH.9.7	Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 
2CH.9.10	And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir; brought algum trees and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	And the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of the 
2CH.9.12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 
2CH.9.14	beside that which the chapmen and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
2CH.9.15	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred 
2CH.9.16	And 
2CH.9.17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays. 
2CH.9.19	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 
2CH.9.21	For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
2CH.9.22	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	And they brought very man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
2CH.9.25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. 
2CH.9.28	And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands. 
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.10.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying, 
2CH.10.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 
2CH.10.5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed. 
2CH.10.6	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people? 
2CH.10.7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever. 
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. 
2CH.10.9	And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter? 
2CH.10.10	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. 
2CH.10.11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 
2CH.10.14	and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.15	So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that the 
2CH.10.16	And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
2CH.10.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the levy; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this day.
2CH.11.1	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
2CH.11.4	Thus saith the 
2CH.11.5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fenced cities. 
2CH.11.11	And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and oil and wine. 
2CH.11.12	And in every several city 
2CH.11.13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border. 
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office unto the 
2CH.11.15	and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made. 
2CH.11.16	And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon. 
2CH.11.18	And Rehoboam took him a wife; Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, 
2CH.11.19	and she bare him sons; Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.) 
2CH.11.22	And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, 
2CH.11.23	And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he sought 
2CH.12.1	And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of the 
2CH.12.2	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against the 
2CH.12.3	with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. 
2CH.12.4	And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the 
2CH.12.6	Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The 
2CH.12.7	And when the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. 
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.12.10	And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king's house. 
2CH.12.11	And it was so, that as oft as the king entered into the house of the 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
2CH.12.14	And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour. 
2CH.13.4	And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel; 
2CH.13.5	Ought ye not to know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. 
2CH.13.7	And there were gathered unto him vain men, sons of Belial, which strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them. 
2CH.13.8	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Have ye not driven out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	and they burn unto the 
2CH.13.12	And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them: and they cried unto the 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the 
2CH.13.19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof. 
2CH.13.20	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years. 
2CH.14.2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the 
2CH.14.3	for he took away the strange altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim; 
2CH.14.4	and commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
2CH.14.6	And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years; because the 
2CH.14.7	For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought the 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: an these were mighty men of valour.
2CH.14.9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	And Asa cried unto the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the 
2CH.14.14	And they smote all the cities round shout Gerar; for the fear of the 
2CH.14.15	They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	And the spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the 
2CH.15.3	Now for long seasons Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law: 
2CH.15.4	But when in their distress they turned unto the 
2CH.15.5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands. 
2CH.15.6	And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city: for God did vex them with all adversity. 
2CH.15.7	But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack: for your work shall be rewarded.
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of the 
2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.15.11	And they sacrificed unto the 
2CH.15.12	And they entered into the covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	and that whosoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	And they sware unto the 
2CH.15.15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the 
2CH.15.16	And also Maacah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
2CH.15.18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
2CH.16.1	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.16.3	 a league between me and thee, as 
2CH.16.4	And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease. 
2CH.16.6	Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on the 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on the 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time. 
2CH.16.11	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the 
2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds 
2CH.17.1	And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 
2CH.17.3	And the 
2CH.17.4	but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the 
2CH.17.6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
2CH.17.8	and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. 
2CH.17.9	And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the 
2CH.17.10	And the fear of the 
2CH.17.11	And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats. 
2CH.17.12	And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store. 
2CH.17.13	And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses: of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand: 
2CH.17.15	and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand: 
2CH.17.16	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the 
2CH.17.17	And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield: 
2CH.17.18	and next to him Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war. 
2CH.17.19	These were they that waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab. 
2CH.18.2	And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up 
2CH.18.3	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and 
2CH.18.4	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel; Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
2CH.18.5	When the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here besides a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the 
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. 
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they sat in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 
2CH.18.10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the 
2CH.18.12	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets 
2CH.18.13	And Micaiah said, As the 
2CH.18.14	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand. 
2CH.18.15	And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the 
2CH.18.17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? 
2CH.18.18	And he said, Therefore hear ye the word of the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.20	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the 
2CH.18.21	And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so. 
2CH.18.22	Now therefore, behold, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the 
2CH.18.24	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
2CH.18.25	And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
2CH.18.26	and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. 
2CH.18.27	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
2CH.18.31	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the 
2CH.18.32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded. 
2CH.18.34	And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.
2CH.19.1	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thine heart to seek God. 
2CH.19.4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto the 
2CH.19.5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, 
2CH.19.6	and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the 
2CH.19.7	Now therefore let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers' 
2CH.19.9	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgements, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards the 
2CH.19.11	And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the 
2CH.20.1	And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 
2CH.20.2	Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi). 
2CH.20.3	And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto the 
2CH.20.4	And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek 
2CH.20.5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the 
2CH.20.6	and he said, O 
2CH.20.7	Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever? 
2CH.20.8	And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	If evil come upon us, the sword, judgement, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save. 
2CH.20.10	And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not; 
2CH.20.11	behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. 
2CH.20.12	O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. 
2CH.20.13	And all Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: thus saith the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	Ye shall not need to fight in this 
2CH.20.18	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the 
2CH.20.19	And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the 
2CH.20.21	And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto the 
2CH.20.22	And when they began to sing and to praise, the 
2CH.20.23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. 
2CH.20.24	And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped. 
2CH.20.25	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking of the spoil, it was so much. 
2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed the 
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the 
2CH.20.28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the 
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that the 
2CH.20.30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
2CH.20.31	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.20.33	Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel. 
2CH.20.35	And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly: 
2CH.20.36	and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
2CH.21.2	And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
2CH.21.3	And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn. 
2CH.21.4	Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.21.7	Howbeit the 
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots. 
2CH.21.10	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand: because he had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, and led Judah astray.
2CH.21.12	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the 
2CH.21.13	but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like as the house of Ahab did; and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself: 
2CH.21.14	behold, the 
2CH.21.15	and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day. 
2CH.21.16	And the 
2CH.21.17	and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. 
2CH.21.18	And after all this the 
2CH.21.19	And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 
2CH.21.20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 
2CH.22.2	Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2CH.22.6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. 
2CH.22.7	Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgement upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them. 
2CH.22.9	And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him, (now he was hiding in Samaria,) and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said; He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the 
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. 
2CH.22.12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. 
2CH.23.2	And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers' 
2CH.23.3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors; 
2CH.23.5	and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the 
2CH.23.6	But let none come into the house of the 
2CH.23.7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out. 
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. 
2CH.23.9	And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God. 
2CH.23.10	And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and 
2CH.23.12	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the 
2CH.23.13	and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets; the singers also 
2CH.23.14	And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the 
2CH.23.15	So they made way for her; and she went to the entry of the horse gate to the king's house: and they slew her there. 
2CH.23.16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be the 
2CH.23.17	And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
2CH.23.18	And Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the 
2CH.23.19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the 
2CH.23.20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
2CH.24.2	And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.24.3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters. 
2CH.24.4	And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of the 
2CH.24.5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. 
2CH.24.6	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of the 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the 
2CH.24.8	So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the 
2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for the 
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. 
2CH.24.11	And it was so, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 
2CH.24.12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. 
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house. 
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. 
2CH.24.18	And they forsook the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the 
2CH.24.20	And the spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the 
2CH.24.21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The 
2CH.24.23	And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and the 
2CH.24.25	And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
2CH.24.26	And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens 
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.25.3	Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants which had killed the king his father. 
2CH.25.4	But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as the 
2CH.25.5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. 
2CH.25.6	He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the 
2CH.25.8	But if thou wilt go, do 
2CH.25.9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The 
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah separated them, 
2CH.25.11	And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. 
2CH.25.12	And 
2CH.25.13	But the men of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.
2CH.25.14	Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. 
2CH.25.15	Wherefore the anger of the 
2CH.25.16	And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that 
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 
2CH.25.18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon; and trode down the thistle. 
2CH.25.19	Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to 
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand 
2CH.25.21	So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
2CH.25.24	And 
2CH.25.25	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the 
2CH.25.28	And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
2CH.26.3	Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.26.5	And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought the 
2CH.26.6	And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in 
2CH.26.7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim. 
2CH.26.8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong. 
2CH.26.9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning 
2CH.26.10	And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: 
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning, made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains. 
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the heads of fathers' 
2CH.26.13	And under their hand was a trained army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging. 
2CH.26.15	And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the 
2CH.26.17	And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the 
2CH.26.18	and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of the 
2CH.26.20	And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the 
2CH.26.21	And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. 
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.27.3	He built the upper gate of the house of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 
2CH.27.5	He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third. 
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.28.2	but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim. 
2CH.28.3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the 
2CH.28.4	And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
2CH.28.5	Wherefore the 
2CH.28.6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken the 
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. 
2CH.28.8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the 
2CH.28.12	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, 
2CH.28.13	and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against the 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 
2CH.28.15	And the men which have been expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. 
2CH.28.17	For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there. 
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. 
2CH.28.21	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the 
2CH.28.22	And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the 
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, 
2CH.28.24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the 
2CH.28.25	And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.3	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the door of the house of the 
2CH.29.4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east, 
2CH.29.5	and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.29.7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Wherefore the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
2CH.29.10	Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, be not now negligent: for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel: and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: 
2CH.29.13	and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel: and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah: 
2CH.29.14	and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the 
2CH.29.16	And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began on the first 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within 
2CH.29.19	Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of the 
2CH.29.20	Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of the 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bullocks; and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar. 
2CH.29.23	And they brought near the he-goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: 
2CH.29.24	and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded 
2CH.29.25	And he set the Levites in the house of the 
2CH.29.26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 
2CH.29.27	And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar, And when the burnt offering began, the song of the 
2CH.29.28	And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this 
2CH.29.29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped. 
2CH.29.30	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the 
2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 
2CH.29.35	And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the 
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
2CH.30.1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the 
2CH.30.2	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the congregation. 
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the 
2CH.30.6	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the 
2CH.30.7	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the 
2CH.30.8	Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto the 
2CH.30.9	For if ye turn again unto the 
2CH.30.10	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	Also in Judah was the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the 
2CH.30.13	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 
2CH.30.14	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. 
2CH.30.15	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth 
2CH.30.16	And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, 
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good 
2CH.30.19	that setteth his heart to seek God, the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that were well skilled 
2CH.30.23	And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept 
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
2CH.30.25	And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. 
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the 
2CH.31.3	 also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, 
2CH.31.4	Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of the 
2CH.31.5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly. 
2CH.31.6	And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto the 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the 
2CH.31.12	And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second. 
2CH.31.13	And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. 
2CH.31.14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east 
2CH.31.15	And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small: 
2CH.31.16	beside them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of the 
2CH.31.17	and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; 
2CH.31.18	and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness: 
2CH.31.19	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city; there were men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites. 
2CH.31.20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before the 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
2CH.32.1	After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water? 
2CH.32.5	And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo 
2CH.32.6	And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, 
2CH.32.7	Be strong and of a good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there is a greater with us than with him: 
2CH.32.8	with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the 
2CH.32.9	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying, 
2CH.32.10	Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The 
2CH.32.12	Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense? 
2CH.32.13	Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands any ways able to deliver their land out of mine hand? 
2CH.32.14	Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither believe ye him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? 
2CH.32.16	And his servants spake yet more against the 
2CH.32.17	He wrote also letters, to rail on the 
2CH.32.18	And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 
2CH.32.19	And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands. 
2CH.32.20	And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven. 
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	Thus the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts unto the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.26	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the 
2CH.32.27	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels; 
2CH.32.28	storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds. 
2CH.32.29	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him very much substance. 
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 
2CH.32.31	Howbeit in 
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem, 
2CH.33.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
2CH.33.4	And he built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2CH.33.6	He also made his Children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.7	And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
2CH.33.8	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers; if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. 
2CH.33.9	And Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, so that they did evil more than did the nations, whom the 
2CH.33.10	And the 
2CH.33.11	Wherefore the 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in distress, he besought the 
2CH.33.13	And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate; and he compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fenced cities of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the 
2CH.33.16	And he built up the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, but only unto the 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and how 
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.23	And he humbled not himself before the 
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images. 
2CH.34.4	And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images, that were on high above them, he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves 
2CH.34.5	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	And 
2CH.34.7	And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the 
2CH.34.9	And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the door, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the 
2CH.34.11	even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. 
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward: and 
2CH.34.13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2CH.34.16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought the king word again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it. 
2CH.34.17	And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king. 
2CH.34.19	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying, 
2CH.34.21	Go ye, inquire of the 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah, and they whom the king 
2CH.34.23	And she said unto them, Thus saith the 
2CH.34.24	Thus saith the 
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched. 
2CH.34.26	But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2CH.34.27	because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the 
2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought the king word again.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up to the house of the 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand 
2CH.34.33	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the 
2CH.35.1	And Josiah kept a passover unto the 
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the 
2CH.35.3	And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the 
2CH.35.4	And prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. 
2CH.35.5	And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brethren the children of the people, and 
2CH.35.6	And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of the 
2CH.35.7	And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance. 
2CH.35.8	And his princes gave for a freewill offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand 
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king's commandment. 
2CH.35.11	And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled 
2CH.35.12	And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to offer unto the 
2CH.35.13	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. 
2CH.35.14	And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron 
2CH.35.15	And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. 
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
2CH.35.18	And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him. 
2CH.35.21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? 
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco, from the month of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. 
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations, unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations. 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of the 
2CH.35.27	and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.2	Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three mouths in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and amerced the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. 
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.10	And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: 
2CH.36.12	and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the 
2CH.36.14	Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the heathen; and they polluted the house of the 
2CH.36.15	And the 
2CH.36.16	but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of the 
2CH.36.17	Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man or ancient: he gave them all into his hand. 
2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.36.19	And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. 
2CH.36.20	And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: 
2CH.36.21	to fulfill the word of the 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
2CH.36.23	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the 
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
EZR.1.2	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the 
EZR.1.3	Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the 
EZR.1.4	And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
EZR.1.5	Then rose up the heads of fathers' 
EZR.1.6	And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. 
EZR.1.7	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the 
EZR.1.8	even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives; 
EZR.1.10	thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. 
EZR.1.11	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

EZR.2.58	All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two. 
EZR.2.59	And these were they which went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, 
EZR.2.60	the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. 
EZR.2.61	And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 
EZR.2.62	These sought their register 
EZR.2.63	And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 
EZR.2.65	beside their menservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. 
EZR.2.66	Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 
EZR.2.67	their camels, four hundred thirty and five; 
EZR.2.68	And some of the heads of fathers' 
EZR.2.69	they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests' garments. 
EZR.2.70	So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
EZR.3.1	And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the 
EZR.3.4	And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and 
EZR.3.5	and afterward the continual burnt offering, and 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the 
EZR.3.7	They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of the 
EZR.3.9	Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. 
EZR.3.10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
EZR.3.11	And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' 
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
EZR.4.1	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded a temple unto the 
EZR.4.2	then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers' 
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, 
EZR.4.5	and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 
EZR.4.9	then 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest 
EZR.4.11	This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men beyond the river, and so forth. 
EZR.4.12	Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will endamage the kings. 
EZR.4.14	Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; 
EZR.4.15	that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city laid waste. 
EZR.4.16	We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the river.
EZR.4.18	The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 
EZR.4.19	And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. 
EZR.4.20	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all 
EZR.4.21	Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me. 
EZR.4.22	And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? 
EZR.4.23	Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. 
EZR.4.24	Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel 
EZR.5.2	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
EZR.5.3	At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the river, and Shethar-bonzenai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall? 
EZR.5.4	Then spake we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? 
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it. 
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were beyond the river, sent unto Darius the king: 
EZR.5.7	they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace. 
EZR.5.8	Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall? 
EZR.5.10	We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them. 
EZR.5.11	And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished. 
EZR.5.12	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God. 
EZR.5.14	And the gold and sliver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 
EZR.5.15	and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place. 
EZR.5.16	Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed. 
EZR.5.17	Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
EZR.6.1	Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record. 
EZR.6.3	In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree; Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 
EZR.6.4	with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: 
EZR.6.5	And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and thou shalt put them in the house of God. 
EZR.6.6	Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: 
EZR.6.7	let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place. 
EZR.6.8	Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered. 
EZR.6.9	And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 
EZR.6.10	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savour unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
EZR.6.11	Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this: 
EZR.6.12	and the God that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples, that shall put forth their hand to alter 
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the river; Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence. 
EZR.6.14	And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. 
EZR.6.16	And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	And they offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. 
EZR.6.19	And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	And the children of Israel, which were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the 
EZR.6.22	and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the 
EZR.7.7	And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
EZR.7.8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	For upon the first 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the 
EZR.7.11	Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of the 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth, 
EZR.7.13	I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee. 
EZR.7.14	Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; 
EZR.7.15	and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem; 
EZR.7.17	therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. 
EZR.7.21	And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence, 
EZR.7.22	unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. 
EZR.7.23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
EZR.7.24	Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them. 
EZR.7.25	And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand, appoint magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not. 
EZR.7.26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgement be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	Now these are the heads of their fathers' 
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel: of the sons of David, Hattush. 
EZR.8.3	Of the sons of Shecaniah; of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. 
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males. 
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males. 
EZR.8.6	And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males. 
EZR.8.7	And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males. 
EZR.8.8	And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males. 
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 
EZR.8.10	And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him an hundred and threescore males. 
EZR.8.11	And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males. 
EZR.8.12	And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him an hundred and ten males. 
EZR.8.13	And of the sons of Adonikam, 
EZR.8.14	And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males. 
EZR.8.15	And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. 
EZR.8.16	Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, which were teachers. 
EZR.8.17	And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, 
EZR.8.18	And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 
EZR.8.19	and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; 
EZR.8.20	and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were expressed by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way, for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
EZR.8.24	Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 
EZR.8.25	and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered: 
EZR.8.26	I even weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents; of gold an hundred talents; 
EZR.8.27	and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold. 
EZR.8.28	And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the 
EZR.8.29	Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth 
EZR.8.32	And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. 
EZR.8.33	And on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites; 
EZR.8.34	the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time. 
EZR.8.35	The children of the captivity, which were come out of exile, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the 
EZR.8.36	And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the river: and they furthered the people and the house of God.
EZR.9.1	Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons; so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. 
EZR.9.3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. 
EZR.9.4	Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat astonied until the evening oblation.
EZR.9.5	And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my mantle rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the 
EZR.9.6	and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to spoiling, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. 
EZR.9.8	And now for a little moment grace hath been shewed from the 
EZR.9.9	For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. 
EZR.9.10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness, 
EZR.9.12	now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. 
EZR.9.13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant, 
EZR.9.14	shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? 
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	Now while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore. 
EZR.10.2	And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married strange women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing. 
EZR.10.3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. 
EZR.10.4	Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it. 
EZR.10.5	Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and 
EZR.10.7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 
EZR.10.8	and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of the captivity. 
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth 
EZR.10.10	And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married strange women, to increase the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now therefore make confession unto the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, as thou hast said concerning us, so must we do. 
EZR.10.13	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. 
EZR.10.14	Let now our princes be appointed for all the congregation, and let all them that are in our cities which have married strange women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this 
EZR.10.16	And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, 
EZR.10.17	And they made an end with all the men that had married strange women by the first day of the first month. 
EZR.10.18	And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married strange women: 
EZR.10.19	And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, 
EZR.10.20	And of the sons of Immer; Hanani and Zebadiah. 
EZR.10.21	And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah. 
EZR.10.22	And of the sons of Pashhur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah. 
EZR.10.23	And of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 
EZR.10.24	And of the singers; Eliashib; and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. 
EZR.10.25	And of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.26	And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah. 
EZR.10.27	And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza. 
EZR.10.28	And of the sons of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai. 
EZR.10.29	And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, Jeremoth. 
EZR.10.30	And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh. 
EZR.10.31	And 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah. 
EZR.10.33	Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei. 
EZR.10.34	Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel; 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi; 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib; 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu; 
EZR.10.38	and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei; 
EZR.10.39	and Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah; 
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai; 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah; 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, Joseph. 
EZR.10.43	Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah. 
EZR.10.44	All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
NEH.1.2	that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. 
NEH.1.4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,
NEH.1.5	and said, I beseech thee, O 
NEH.1.6	Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: yea, I and my father's house have sinned, 
NEH.1.7	we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgements, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples: 
NEH.1.9	but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there. 
NEH.1.10	Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. (Now I was cupbearer to the king.)
NEH.2.1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been 
NEH.2.2	And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid. 
NEH.2.3	And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? 
NEH.2.4	Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it. 
NEH.2.6	And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 
NEH.2.7	Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah; 
NEH.2.8	and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen. 
NEH.2.10	And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. 
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 
NEH.2.12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. 
NEH.2.13	And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the dragon's well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. 
NEH.2.15	Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. 
NEH.2.16	And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. 
NEH.2.17	Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach. 
NEH.2.18	And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also of the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king? 
NEH.2.20	Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri. 
NEH.3.3	And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. 
NEH.3.4	And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. 
NEH.3.5	And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord. 
NEH.3.6	And the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. 
NEH.3.7	And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, 
NEH.3.8	Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem even unto the broad wall. 
NEH.3.9	And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem. 
NEH.3.10	And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah. 
NEH.3.11	Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces. 
NEH.3.12	And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. 
NEH.3.13	The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate. 
NEH.3.14	And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. 
NEH.3.15	And the fountain gate repaired Shallum the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. 
NEH.3.16	After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men. 
NEH.3.17	After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district. 
NEH.3.18	After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah. 
NEH.3.19	And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the going up to the armoury at the turning 
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning 
NEH.3.21	After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib. 
NEH.3.22	And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain. 
NEH.3.23	After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house. 
NEH.3.24	After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the turning 
NEH.3.25	Palal the son of Uzai 
NEH.3.26	(Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.) 
NEH.3.27	After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel. 
NEH.3.28	Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house. 
NEH.3.29	After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate. 
NEH.3.30	After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. 
NEH.3.31	After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner. 
NEH.3.32	And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
NEH.4.1	But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 
NEH.4.2	And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned? 
NEH.4.3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall. 
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up to spoiling in a land of captivity: 
NEH.4.5	and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked 
NEH.4.6	So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half 
NEH.4.7	But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, 
NEH.4.8	and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein. 
NEH.4.9	But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. 
NEH.4.10	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. 
NEH.4.11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. 
NEH.4.12	And it came to pass that, when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us. 
NEH.4.13	Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, In the open places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
NEH.4.14	And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses. 
NEH.4.15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
NEH.4.16	And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. 
NEH.4.17	They that builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon; 
NEH.4.18	and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. 
NEH.4.19	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another: 
NEH.4.20	in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God shall fight for us. 
NEH.4.21	So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. 
NEH.4.22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day. 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one 
NEH.5.1	Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 
NEH.5.2	For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get corn, that we may eat and live. 
NEH.5.3	Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get corn, because of the dearth. 
NEH.5.4	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute 
NEH.5.5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage 
NEH.5.6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them. 
NEH.5.8	And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word. 
NEH.5.9	Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? 
NEH.5.10	And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and corn on usury. I pray you, let us leave off this usury. 
NEH.5.11	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. 
NEH.5.12	Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. 
NEH.5.13	Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. 
NEH.5.16	Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. 
NEH.5.17	Moreover there were at my table of the Jews and the rulers an hundred and fifty men, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that were round about us. 
NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 
NEH.5.19	Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;) 
NEH.6.2	that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in 
NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? 
NEH.6.4	And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 
NEH.6.5	Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
NEH.6.6	wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words. 
NEH.6.7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. 
NEH.6.8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
NEH.6.9	For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, 
NEH.6.10	And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. 
NEH.6.11	And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. 
NEH.6.12	And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him: but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 
NEH.6.14	Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth 
NEH.6.16	And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard 
NEH.6.17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and 
NEH.6.18	For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife. 
NEH.6.19	Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. 
NEH.7.1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
NEH.7.2	that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 
NEH.7.3	And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand 
NEH.7.4	Now the city was wide and large: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
NEH.7.5	And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and I found written therein: 
NEH.7.6	These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

NEH.7.32	The men of Beth-el and Ai, an hundred twenty and three. 
NEH.7.33	The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two. 
NEH.7.34	The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four. 
NEH.7.35	The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty. 
NEH.7.36	The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five. 
NEH.7.37	The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one. 
NEH.7.38	The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty. 
NEH.7.39	The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three. 
NEH.7.40	The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

NEH.7.45	The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight. 
NEH.7.46	The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth; 
NEH.7.47	the children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon; 
NEH.7.48	the children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Salmai; 
NEH.7.49	the children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar; 
NEH.7.50	the children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda; 
NEH.7.51	the children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah; 
NEH.7.52	The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephushesim; 
NEH.7.53	the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur; 
NEH.7.54	the children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha; 
NEH.7.55	the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah; 
NEH.7.56	the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha. 
NEH.7.57	The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida; 
NEH.7.58	the children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel; 
NEH.7.59	the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon. 
NEH.7.60	All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two. 
NEH.7.61	And these were they which went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their fathers' houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel: 
NEH.7.62	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. 
NEH.7.63	And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 
NEH.7.64	These sought their register 
NEH.7.65	And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. 
NEH.7.66	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 
NEH.7.67	beside their menservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven, and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. 
NEH.7.68	Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 
NEH.7.69	 camels, four hundred thirty and five; 
NEH.7.70	And some from among the heads of fathers' 
NEH.7.71	And some of the heads of fathers' 
NEH.7.72	And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments. 
NEH.7.73	So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.
NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the 
NEH.8.2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 
NEH.8.3	And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were 
NEH.8.4	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, 
NEH.8.5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: 
NEH.8.6	and Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people 
NEH.8.8	And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.
NEH.8.9	And Nehemiah, which was the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the 
NEH.8.10	Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of the 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. 
NEH.8.12	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
NEH.8.13	And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' 
NEH.8.14	And they found written in the law, how that the 
NEH.8.15	and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. 
NEH.8.16	So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim. 
NEH.8.17	And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. 
NEH.8.18	Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the ordinance.
NEH.9.1	Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them. 
NEH.9.2	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 
NEH.9.3	And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the 
NEH.9.4	Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.9.6	Thou art the 
NEH.9.7	Then art the 
NEH.9.8	and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous. 
NEH.9.9	And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; 
NEH.9.10	and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them; and didst get thee a name, as it is this day. 
NEH.9.11	And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	Moreover thou leddest them in a pillar of cloud by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. 
NEH.9.13	Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgements and true laws, good statutes and commandments: 
NEH.9.14	and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 
NEH.9.15	and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst lifted up thine hand to give them. 
NEH.9.16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments, 
NEH.9.17	and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and forsookest them not. 
NEH.9.18	Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 
NEH.9.19	yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. 
NEH.9.20	Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, 
NEH.9.22	Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
NEH.9.23	Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. 
NEH.9.24	So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. 
NEH.9.25	And they took fenced cities, and a fat land and possessed houses full of good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. 
NEH.9.26	Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations. 
NEH.9.27	Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries. 
NEH.9.28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; 
NEH.9.29	and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgements, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. 
NEH.9.30	Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. 
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. 
NEH.9.32	Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers; and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. 
NEH.9.33	Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly: 
NEH.9.34	neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. 
NEH.9.35	For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. 
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it. 
NEH.9.37	And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. 
NEH.9.38	And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, 
NEH.10.1	Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah the Tirshatha, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah; 
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah; 
NEH.10.3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah; 
NEH.10.4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch; 
NEH.10.5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah; 
NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch; 
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin; 
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests. 
NEH.10.9	And the Levites: namely, Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel; 
NEH.10.10	and their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan; 
NEH.10.11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah; 
NEH.10.12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah; 
NEH.10.13	Hodiah, Bani, Beninu. 
NEH.10.14	The chiefs of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani; 
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai; 
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin; 
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur; 
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai; 
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nobai; 
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir; 
NEH.10.21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua; 
NEH.10.22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah; 
NEH.10.23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub; 
NEH.10.24	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek; 
NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah; 
NEH.10.26	and Ahiah, Hanan, Anan; 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, Baanah. 
NEH.10.28	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one that had knowledge and understanding; 
NEH.10.29	They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and to do all the commandments of the 
NEH.10.30	and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons: 
NEH.10.31	and if the peoples of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day: and that we would forgo the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
NEH.10.32	Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; 
NEH.10.33	for the shewbread, and for the continual meal offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 
NEH.10.34	And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the 
NEH.10.35	and to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, unto the house of the 
NEH.10.36	also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God: 
NEH.10.37	and that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our heave offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. 
NEH.10.38	And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house. 
NEH.10.39	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave offering of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the 
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem. 
NEH.11.3	Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, 
NEH.11.4	And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. 
NEH.11.6	All the sons of Perez that dwelt in Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men. 
NEH.11.7	And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah. 
NEH.11.8	And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight. 
NEH.11.9	And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city. 
NEH.11.10	Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God, 
NEH.11.12	and their brethren that did the work of the house, eight hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, 
NEH.11.13	and his brethren, chiefs of fathers' 
NEH.11.14	and their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim. 
NEH.11.15	And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 
NEH.11.16	and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God; 
NEH.11.17	and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four. 
NEH.11.19	Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.
NEH.11.20	And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance. 
NEH.11.21	But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim. 
NEH.11.22	The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God. 
NEH.11.23	For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required. 
NEH.11.24	And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people. 
NEH.11.25	And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof; 
NEH.11.26	and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet; 
NEH.11.27	and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof; 
NEH.11.28	and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns thereof; 
NEH.11.29	and in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth; 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom. 
NEH.11.31	The children of Benjamin also 
NEH.11.32	at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah; 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim; 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat; 
NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 
NEH.11.36	And of the Levites, certain courses in Judah 
NEH.12.1	Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra; 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush; 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth; 
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah; 
NEH.12.5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah; 
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah; 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua. 
NEH.12.8	Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, 
NEH.12.9	Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brethren, were over against them in wards. 
NEH.12.10	And Jeshua begat Joiakim, and Joiakim begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	and Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua. 
NEH.12.12	And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers' 
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Gennethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
NEH.12.19	and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
NEH.12.20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. 
NEH.12.22	The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded heads of fathers' 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, heads of fathers' 
NEH.12.24	And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward against ward. 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the storehouses of the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
NEH.12.27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication, with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
NEH.12.28	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites; 
NEH.12.29	also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. 
NEH.12.31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; 
NEH.12.32	and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; 
NEH.12.36	and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them: 
NEH.12.37	And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. 
NEH.12.38	And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall; 
NEH.12.39	and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard. 
NEH.12.40	So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 
NEH.12.41	and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
NEH.12.42	and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. 
NEH.12.43	And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
NEH.12.44	And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. 
NEH.12.45	And they kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, and 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 
NEH.12.47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they sanctified for the Levites; and the Levites sanctified for the sons of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever; 
NEH.13.2	because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. 
NEH.13.4	Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah, 
NEH.13.5	had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave offerings for the priests. 
NEH.13.6	But in all this 
NEH.13.7	and I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal offerings and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. 
NEH.13.11	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
NEH.13.12	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the wine and the oil unto the treasuries. 
NEH.13.13	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren. 
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.
NEH.13.15	In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses 
NEH.13.16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. 
NEH.13.19	And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. 
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
NEH.13.23	In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, 
NEH.13.24	and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. 
NEH.13.25	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, 
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did strange women cause to sin. 
NEH.13.27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying strange women? 
NEH.13.28	And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. 
NEH.13.30	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed wards for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work; 
NEH.13.31	and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
EST.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) 
EST.1.2	that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, 
EST.1.3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: 
EST.1.4	when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. 
EST.1.5	And when these days were fulfilled, he king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; 
EST.1.6	 white 
EST.1.7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king. 
EST.1.8	And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure. 
EST.1.9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 
EST.1.11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the peoples and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. 
EST.1.12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. 
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgement; 
EST.1.14	and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom:) 
EST.1.15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? 
EST.1.16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.17	For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. 
EST.1.18	And this day shall the princesses of Persia and Media which have heard of the deed of the queen say 
EST.1.19	If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. 
EST.1.20	And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. 
EST.1.21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: 
EST.1.22	for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should publish it according to the language of his people.
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: 
EST.2.3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that young virgins unto Shushan the palace, they may gather together all the fair to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: 
EST.2.4	and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so. 
EST.2.5	There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 
EST.2.6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar he king of Babylon had carried away. 
EST.2.7	And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter. 
EST.2.8	So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 
EST.2.9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women. 
EST.2.10	Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. 
EST.2.11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. 
EST.2.12	Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women, twelve months, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, 
EST.2.13	then in this wise came the maiden unto the king, whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name. 
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
EST.2.17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king. 
EST.2.19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. 
EST.2.20	Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. 
EST.2.22	And the thing was known to Mordecai, who shewed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king 
EST.2.23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
EST.3.1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. 
EST.3.2	And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence. 
EST.3.3	Then the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment? 
EST.3.4	Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
EST.3.5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. 
EST.3.6	But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
EST.3.7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, 
EST.3.8	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from 
EST.3.9	If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the 
EST.3.10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy. 
EST.3.11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. 
EST.3.12	Then were the king's scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's ring. 
EST.3.13	And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth 
EST.3.14	A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day. 
EST.3.15	The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace: and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
EST.4.1	Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry: 
EST.4.2	and he came even before the king's gate: for none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. 
EST.4.4	And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him: but he received it not.
EST.4.5	Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was. 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate. 
EST.4.7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. 
EST.4.8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her; and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people. 
EST.4.9	And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai, 
EST.4.11	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. 
EST.4.12	And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. 
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house shall perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this? 
EST.4.15	Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house. 
EST.5.2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. 
EST.5.3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom. 
EST.5.4	And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. 
EST.5.5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall he granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. 
EST.5.7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 
EST.5.8	if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said.
EST.5.9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife. 
EST.5.11	And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 
EST.5.12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow also am I invited by her together with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate. 
EST.5.14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
EST.6.1	On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king. 
EST.6.2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those that kept the door, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. 
EST.6.3	And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
EST.6.4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 
EST.6.5	And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself? 
EST.6.7	And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 
EST.6.8	let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set: 
EST.6.9	and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. 
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. 
EST.6.11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.
EST.6.12	And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered. 
EST.6.13	And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. 
EST.6.14	While they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 
EST.7.2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall he granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. 
EST.7.3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: 
EST.7.4	for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage. 
EST.7.5	Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? 
EST.7.6	And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
EST.7.7	And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine 
EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 
EST.7.9	Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon. 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
EST.8.1	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. 
EST.8.2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king. 
EST.8.5	And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces: 
EST.8.6	for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? 
EST.8.7	Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. 
EST.8.8	Write ye also to the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. 
EST.8.9	Then were the king's scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month, Sivan, on the three and twentieth 
EST.8.10	And he wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service, bred of the stud: 
EST.8.11	wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, 
EST.8.12	upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, 
EST.8.13	A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
EST.8.14	So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king's service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.
EST.8.15	And Mordecai went forth front the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad. 
EST.8.16	The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honour. 
EST.8.17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them; 
EST.9.2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples. 
EST.9.3	And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them. 
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces: for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. 
EST.9.5	And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them. 
EST.9.6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 
EST.9.7	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. 
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. 
EST.9.12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done. 
EST.9.13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. 
EST.9.14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. 
EST.9.15	And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. 
EST.9.16	And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. 
EST.9.17	 on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.18	But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth 
EST.9.19	Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar 
EST.9.20	And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, 
EST.9.21	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 
EST.9.22	as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. 
EST.9.23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; 
EST.9.24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; 
EST.9.25	but when 
EST.9.26	Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; 
EST.9.28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed. 
EST.9.29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
EST.9.30	And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, 
EST.9.31	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry. 
EST.9.32	And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. 
EST.10.2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren; seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
JOB.1.2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east 
JOB.1.4	And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burn offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said. It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	And the 
JOB.1.8	And the 
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face. 
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.13	And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, 
JOB.1.14	that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
JOB.1.15	and the Sabeans fell 
JOB.1.16	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and : I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
JOB.1.17	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and :
JOB.1.17	I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
JOB.1.18	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
JOB.1.19	and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and : I only am escaped alone to tell thee 
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; 
JOB.1.21	and he said, Naked came : I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall : I return thither: The 
JOB.1.22	: In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God with foolishness.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.3	And the 
JOB.2.4	And Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face. 
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So Satan went forth from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat among the ashes. 
JOB.2.9	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die. 
JOB.2.10	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: And they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: For they saw that his grief was very great.
JOB.3.1	After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
JOB.3.2	And Job answered and said:
JOB.3.3	Let the day perish wherein I was born,
JOB.3.3	And the night which said, There is a man child conceived
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness;
JOB.3.4	Let not God regard it from above,
JOB.3.4	Neither let the light shine upon it
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;
JOB.3.5	Let a cloud dwell upon it;
JOB.3.5	Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it:
JOB.3.6	Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;
JOB.3.6	Let it not come into the number of the months
JOB.3.7	Lo, let that night be barren;
JOB.3.7	Let no joyful voice come therein
JOB.3.8	Let them curse it that curse the day,
JOB.3.8	Who are ready to rouse up leviathan
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:
JOB.3.9	Let it look for light, but have none;
JOB.3.9	Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:
JOB.3.10	Because it shut not up the doors of my 
JOB.3.10	Nor hid trouble from mine eyes
JOB.3.11	Why died I not from the womb?
JOB.3.11	Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me?
JOB.3.12	or why the breasts, that I should suck?
JOB.3.13	For now should I have lain down and been quiet;
JOB.3.13	I should have slept; then had I been at rest:
JOB.3.14	With kings and counsellors of the earth,
JOB.3.14	Which built up waste places for themselves;
JOB.3.15	Or with princes that had gold,
JOB.3.15	Who filled their houses with silver:
JOB.3.16	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;
JOB.3.16	As infants which never saw light
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from troubling;
JOB.3.17	And there the weary be at rest
JOB.3.18	There the prisoners are at ease together;
JOB.3.18	They hear not the voice of the taskmaster
JOB.3.19	The small and great are there;
JOB.3.19	And the servant is free from his master
JOB.3.20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
JOB.3.20	And life unto the bitter in soul;
JOB.3.21	Which long for death, but it cometh not;
JOB.3.21	And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
JOB.3.22	Which rejoice exceedingly,
JOB.3.22	And are glad, when they can find the grave?
JOB.3.23	And whom God hath hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing cometh before I eat,
JOB.3.24	And my roarings are poured out like water
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I fear cometh upon me,
JOB.3.25	And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;
JOB.3.26	But trouble cometh.
JOB.4.1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
JOB.4.2	If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?
JOB.4.2	But who can withhold himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, thou hast instructed many,
JOB.4.3	And thou hast strengthened the weak hands
JOB.4.4	Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
JOB.4.4	And thou hast confirmed the feeble knees
JOB.4.5	But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest;
JOB.4.5	It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled
JOB.4.6	Is not thy fear 
JOB.4.7	Remember, I pray thee, who 
JOB.4.7	Or where were the upright cut off?
JOB.4.8	According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
JOB.4.8	And sow trouble, reap the same
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish,
JOB.4.9	And by the blast of his anger are they consumed
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
JOB.4.10	And the teeth of the young lions, are broken
JOB.4.11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad
JOB.4.12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
JOB.4.12	And mine ear received a whisper thereof
JOB.4.13	In thoughts from the visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	When deep sleep falleth on men,
JOB.4.14	Fear came upon me, and trembling,
JOB.4.14	Which made all my bones to shake
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face;
JOB.4.15	The hair of my flesh stood up
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;
JOB.4.16	A form was before mine eyes:
JOB.4.17	Shall mortal man be more just than God?
JOB.4.17	Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
JOB.4.18	Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants;
JOB.4.18	And his angels he chargeth with folly:
JOB.4.19	How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,
JOB.4.19	Whose foundation is in the dust,
JOB.4.19	Which are crushed before the moth!
JOB.4.20	Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed:
JOB.4.20	They perish for ever without any regarding it
JOB.4.21	Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
JOB.4.21	They die, and that without wisdom.
JOB.5.1	Call now; is there any that will answer thee?
JOB.5.1	And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
JOB.5.2	For vexation killeth the foolish man,
JOB.5.2	And jealousy slayeth the silly one.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root:
JOB.5.3	But suddenly I cursed his habitation.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety,
JOB.5.4	And they are crushed in the gate,
JOB.5.4	Neither is there any to deliver them.
JOB.5.5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
JOB.5.5	And taketh it even out of the thorns,
JOB.5.5	And the snare gapeth for their substance
JOB.5.6	For affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
JOB.5.6	Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
JOB.5.7	But man is born unto trouble,
JOB.5.7	As the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	But as for me, I would seek unto God,
JOB.5.8	And unto God would I commit my cause:
JOB.5.9	Which doeth great things and unsearchable;
JOB.5.9	Marvelous things without number:
JOB.5.10	Who giveth rain upon the earth,
JOB.5.10	And sendeth waters upon the fields:
JOB.5.11	So that he setteth up on high those that be low;
JOB.5.11	And those which mourn are exalted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,
JOB.5.12	So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
JOB.5.13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:
JOB.5.13	And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime,
JOB.5.14	And grope at noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saveth from the sword of their mouth,
JOB.5.15	Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the poor hath hope,
JOB.5.16	And iniquity stoppeth her mouth
JOB.5.17	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:
JOB.5.17	Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For he maketh sore, and bindeth up;
JOB.5.18	He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He shall deliver thee in six troubles;
JOB.5.19	Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
JOB.5.20	In famine he shall redeem thee from death;
JOB.5.20	And in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;
JOB.5.21	Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
JOB.5.22	At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh;
JOB.5.22	Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
JOB.5.23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;
JOB.5.23	And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
JOB.5.24	And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;
JOB.5.24	And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.
JOB.5.25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
JOB.5.25	And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,
JOB.5.26	Like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.
JOB.5.27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;
JOB.5.27	Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.6.2	Oh that my vexation were but weighed,
JOB.6.2	And my calamity laid in the balances together!
JOB.6.3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas:
JOB.6.3	Therefore have my words been rash.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
JOB.6.4	The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up:
JOB.6.4	The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
JOB.6.5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
JOB.6.5	Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt?
JOB.6.6	Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	My soul refuseth to touch 
JOB.6.7	They are as loathsome meat to me
JOB.6.8	Oh that I might have my request;
JOB.6.8	And that God would grant 
JOB.6.9	Even that it would please God to crush me;
JOB.6.9	That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	Then should I yet have comfort;
JOB.6.10	Yea, I would exult in pain that spareth not:
JOB.6.10	For I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should wait?
JOB.6.11	And what is mine end, at I should be patient?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones?
JOB.6.12	Or is my flesh of brass?
JOB.6.13	Is it not that I have no help in me,
JOB.6.13	And that effectual working is driven quite from me?
JOB.6.14	To him that is ready to faint kindness 
JOB.6.14	Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
JOB.6.15	As the channel of brooks that pass away;
JOB.6.16	Which are black by reason of the ice,
JOB.6.17	What time they wax warm, they vanish:
JOB.6.17	When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
JOB.6.18	The caravans 
JOB.6.18	They go up into the waste, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema looked,
JOB.6.19	The companies of Sheba waited for them.
JOB.6.20	They were ashamed because they had hoped;
JOB.6.20	They came thither, and were confounded.
JOB.6.21	For now ye are nothing;
JOB.6.21	Ye see a terror, and are afraid
JOB.6.22	Did I say, Give unto me?
JOB.6.22	Or, offer a present for me of your substance?
JOB.6.23	Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand?
JOB.6.23	Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will hold my peace:
JOB.6.24	And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forcible are words of uprightness!
JOB.6.25	But what doth your arguing reprove?
JOB.6.26	Do ye imagine to reprove words?
JOB.6.26	Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind.
JOB.6.27	Yea, ye would cast 
JOB.6.27	And make merchandise of your friend.
JOB.6.28	Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;
JOB.6.28	For surely I shall not lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice;
JOB.6.29	Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice on my tongue?
JOB.6.30	Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
JOB.7.1	Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?
JOB.7.1	And are not his days like the days of an hireling?
JOB.7.2	As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow,
JOB.7.2	And as an hireling that looketh for his wages:
JOB.7.3	So am I made to possess months of vanity,
JOB.7.3	And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say,
JOB.7.4	When shall I arise? but the night is long;
JOB.7.4	And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
JOB.7.5	My skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
JOB.7.6	And are spent without hope
JOB.7.7	Oh remember that my life is wind:
JOB.7.7	Mine eye shall no more see good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more:
JOB.7.8	Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.
JOB.7.9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,
JOB.7.9	So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.
JOB.7.10	He shall return no more to his house,
JOB.7.10	Neither shall his place know him any more.
JOB.7.11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,
JOB.7.12	That thou settest a watch over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
JOB.7.13	My couch shall ease my complaint;
JOB.7.14	Then thou scarest me with dreams,
JOB.7.14	And terrifiest me through visions:
JOB.7.15	So that my soul chooseth strangling,
JOB.7.15	And death rather than 
JOB.7.16	I loathe 
JOB.7.16	Let me alone; for my days are vanity
JOB.7.17	What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him,
JOB.7.17	And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him,
JOB.7.18	And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,
JOB.7.18	And try him every moment?
JOB.7.19	How long wilt thou not look away from me,
JOB.7.19	Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men?
JOB.7.20	Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,
JOB.7.20	So that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?
JOB.7.21	For now shall I lie down in the dust;
JOB.7.21	And thou shall seek me diligently, but I shall not be.
JOB.8.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.8.2	How long wilt thou speak these things?
JOB.8.2	And 
JOB.8.3	Doth God pervert judgement?
JOB.8.3	Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
JOB.8.4	If thy children have sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	And he have delivered them into the hand of their transgression:
JOB.8.5	If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God,
JOB.8.5	And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
JOB.8.6	If thou wert pure and upright;
JOB.8.6	Surely now he would awake for thee,
JOB.8.6	And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
JOB.8.7	And though thy beginning was small,
JOB.8.7	Yet thy latter end should greatly increase
JOB.8.8	For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
JOB.8.8	And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:
JOB.8.9	(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
JOB.8.9	Because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
JOB.8.10	Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
JOB.8.10	And utter words out of their heart?
JOB.8.11	Can the rush grow up without mire?
JOB.8.11	Can the flag grow without water?
JOB.8.12	Whilst it is yet in its greenness, 
JOB.8.12	It withereth before any 
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all that forget God;
JOB.8.13	And the hope of the godless man shall perish:
JOB.8.14	Whose confidence shall break in sunder,
JOB.8.14	And whose trust is a spider's web.
JOB.8.15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
JOB.8.15	He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
JOB.8.16	He is green before the sun,
JOB.8.16	And his shoots go forth over his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots are wrapped about the heap,
JOB.8.17	He beholdeth the place of stones.
JOB.8.18	If he be destroyed from his place,
JOB.8.18	Then it shall deny him, 
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of his way,
JOB.8.19	And out of the earth shall others spring
JOB.8.20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
JOB.8.20	Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter,
JOB.8.21	And thy lips with shouting.
JOB.8.22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;
JOB.8.22	And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.9.2	Of a truth I know that it is so:
JOB.9.2	But how can man be just with God?
JOB.9.3	If he be pleased to contend with him,
JOB.9.3	He cannot answer him one of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?
JOB.9.5	Which removeth the mountains, and they know it not,
JOB.9.5	When he overturneth them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	Which shaketh the earth out of her place,
JOB.9.6	And the pillars thereof tremble.
JOB.9.7	Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not;
JOB.9.7	And sealeth up the stars.
JOB.9.8	Which alone stretcheth out the heavens,
JOB.9.8	And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	Which maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
JOB.9.9	And the chambers of the south.
JOB.9.10	Which doeth great things past finding out;
JOB.9.10	Yea, marvelous things without number.
JOB.9.11	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
JOB.9.11	He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
JOB.9.12	Behold, he seizeth 
JOB.9.12	Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
JOB.9.13	God will not withdraw his anger;
JOB.9.13	The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him
JOB.9.14	How much less shall I answer him,
JOB.9.14	And choose out my words 
JOB.9.15	Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;
JOB.9.15	I would make supplication to mine adversary.
JOB.9.16	If I had called, and he had answered me;
JOB.9.16	Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.
JOB.9.17	For he breaketh me with a tempest,
JOB.9.17	And multiplieth my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not suffer me to take my breath,
JOB.9.18	But filleth me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If 
JOB.9.19	And if of judgement, who will appoint me a time?
JOB.9.20	Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me:
JOB.9.20	Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.
JOB.9.21	I am perfect; I regard not myself;
JOB.9.21	I despise my life
JOB.9.22	It is all one; therefore I say,
JOB.9.22	He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
JOB.9.23	If the scourge slay suddenly,
JOB.9.23	He will mock at the trial of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
JOB.9.24	He covereth the faces of the judges thereof;
JOB.9.24	If 
JOB.9.25	Now my days are swifter than a post:
JOB.9.25	They flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They are passed away as the swift ships:
JOB.9.26	As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will put off my 
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sorrows,
JOB.9.28	I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
JOB.9.29	I shall be condemned;
JOB.9.29	Why then do I labour in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow water,
JOB.9.30	And make my hands never so clean;
JOB.9.31	Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch,
JOB.9.31	And mine own clothes shall abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
JOB.9.32	That we should come together in judgement.
JOB.9.33	There is no daysman betwixt us,
JOB.9.33	That might lay his hand upon us both.
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me,
JOB.9.34	And let not his terror make me afraid:
JOB.9.35	Then would I speak, and not fear him;
JOB.9.35	For I am not so in myself.
JOB.10.1	My soul is weary of my life;
JOB.10.1	I will give free course to my complaint;
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;
JOB.10.2	Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
JOB.10.3	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress,
JOB.10.3	That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands,
JOB.10.3	And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Hast thou eyes of flesh,
JOB.10.4	Or seest thou as man seeth?
JOB.10.5	Are thy days as the days of man,
JOB.10.5	Or thy years as man's days,
JOB.10.6	That thou inquirest after mine iniquity,
JOB.10.6	And searchest after my sin,
JOB.10.7	Although thou knowest that I am not wicked;
JOB.10.7	And there is none that can deliver out of thine hand?
JOB.10.8	Thine hands have framed me and fashioned me
JOB.10.8	Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay;
JOB.10.9	And wilt thou bring me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
JOB.10.10	And curdled me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	And knit me together with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	Thou hast granted me life and favour,
JOB.10.12	And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	Yet these things thou didst hide in thine heart;
JOB.10.13	I know that this is with thee:
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then thou markest me,
JOB.10.14	And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
JOB.10.15	If I be wicked, woe unto me;
JOB.10.15	And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head;
JOB.10.15	Being filled with ignominy
JOB.10.15	And looking upon mine affliction.
JOB.10.16	And if 
JOB.10.16	And again thou shewest thyself marvelous upon me.
JOB.10.17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me,
JOB.10.17	And increasest thine indignation upon me;
JOB.10.17	Changes and warfare are with me.
JOB.10.18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been;
JOB.10.19	I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Are not my days few? cease then,
JOB.10.20	And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
JOB.10.21	Before I go whence I shall not return,
JOB.10.22	A land of thick darkness, as darkness 
JOB.10.22	And where the light is as darkness.
JOB.11.1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
JOB.11.2	Should not the multitude of words be answered?
JOB.11.2	And should a man full of talk be justified?
JOB.11.3	Should thy boastings make men hold their peace?
JOB.11.3	And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
JOB.11.4	For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure,
JOB.11.4	And I am clean in thine eyes.
JOB.11.5	But Oh that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	And open his lips against thee;
JOB.11.6	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	That it is manifold in effectual working!
JOB.11.6	Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth
JOB.11.7	Canst thou by searching find out God?
JOB.11.7	Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
JOB.11.8	It is high as heaven; what canst thou do?
JOB.11.8	Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?
JOB.11.9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
JOB.11.9	And broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he pass through, and shut up,
JOB.11.10	And call unto judgement, then who can hinder him?
JOB.11.11	For he knoweth vain men:
JOB.11.11	He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.
JOB.11.12	But vain man is void of understanding,
JOB.11.12	Yea, man is born as a wild ass's colt
JOB.11.13	If thou set thine heart aright,
JOB.11.13	And stretch out thine hands toward him;
JOB.11.14	If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,
JOB.11.14	And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents;
JOB.11.15	Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
JOB.11.15	Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
JOB.11.16	For thou shalt forget thy misery;
JOB.11.16	Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away:
JOB.11.17	And 
JOB.11.17	Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
JOB.11.18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	Yea, thou shalt search 
JOB.11.19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
JOB.11.19	Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
JOB.11.20	And they shall have no way to flee,
JOB.11.20	And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
JOB.12.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.12.2	No doubt but ye are the people,
JOB.12.2	And wisdom shall die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you;
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you:
JOB.12.3	Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
JOB.12.4	I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour,
JOB.12.4	The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.
JOB.12.5	In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune;
JOB.12.5	It is ready for them whose foot slippeth
JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers prosper,
JOB.12.6	And they that provoke God are secure;
JOB.12.6	Into whose hand God bringeth 
JOB.12.7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
JOB.12.7	And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;
JOB.12.8	And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
JOB.12.9	Who knoweth not in all these,
JOB.12.9	That the hand of 
JOB.12.10	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
JOB.12.10	And the breath of all mankind.
JOB.12.11	Doth not the ear try words,
JOB.12.11	Even as the palate tasteth its meat?
JOB.12.12	With aged men is wisdom,
JOB.12.12	And in length of days understanding.
JOB.12.13	With him is wisdom and might;
JOB.12.13	He hath counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again;
JOB.12.14	He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
JOB.12.15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up;
JOB.12.15	Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
JOB.12.16	With him is strength and effectual working;
JOB.12.16	The deceived and the deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,
JOB.12.17	And judges maketh he fools.
JOB.12.18	He looseth the bond of kings,
JOB.12.18	And bindeth their loins with a girdle.
JOB.12.19	He leadeth priests away spoiled,
JOB.12.19	And overthroweth the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He removeth the speech of the trusty,
JOB.12.20	And taketh away the understanding of the elders.
JOB.12.21	He poureth contempt upon princes,
JOB.12.21	And looseth the belt of the strong.
JOB.12.22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
JOB.12.22	And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
JOB.12.23	He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them:
JOB.12.23	He spreadeth the nations abroad, and bringeth them in.
JOB.12.24	He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth,
JOB.12.24	And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light,
JOB.12.25	And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
JOB.13.1	Lo, mine eye hath seen all 
JOB.13.1	Mine ear hath heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What ye know, 
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior unto you.
JOB.13.3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
JOB.13.3	And I desire to reason with God.
JOB.13.4	But ye are forgers of lies,
JOB.13.4	Ye are all physicians of no value.
JOB.13.5	Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!
JOB.13.5	And it should be your wisdom.
JOB.13.6	Hear now my reasoning,
JOB.13.6	And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will ye speak unrighteously for God,
JOB.13.7	And talk deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Will ye respect his person?
JOB.13.8	Will ye contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Is it good that he should search you out?
JOB.13.9	Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprove you,
JOB.13.10	If ye do secretly respect persons.
JOB.13.11	Shall not his excellency make you afraid,
JOB.13.11	And his dread fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your memorable sayings 
JOB.13.12	Your defences 
JOB.13.13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak,
JOB.13.13	And let come on me what wilt.
JOB.13.14	Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth,
JOB.13.14	And put my life in mine hand?
JOB.13.15	Though he slay me, yet will I wait for him:
JOB.13.15	Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.
JOB.13.16	This also shall be my salvation;
JOB.13.16	For a godless man shall not come before him.
JOB.13.17	Hear diligently my speech,
JOB.13.17	And let my declaration be in your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold now, I have ordered my cause;
JOB.13.18	I know that I am righteous.
JOB.13.19	Who is he that will contend with me?
JOB.13.19	For now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost.
JOB.13.20	Only do not two things unto me,
JOB.13.20	Then will I not hide myself from thy face:
JOB.13.21	Withdraw thine hand far from me;
JOB.13.21	And let not thy terror make me afraid.
JOB.13.22	Then call thou, and I will answer;
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak, and answer thou me
JOB.13.23	How many are mine iniquities and sins?
JOB.13.23	Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
JOB.13.24	And holdest me for thine enemy?
JOB.13.25	Wilt thou harass a driven leaf?
JOB.13.25	And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	For thou writest bitter things against me,
JOB.13.26	And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:
JOB.13.27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and markest all my paths;
JOB.13.27	Thou drawest thee a line about the soles of my feet:
JOB.13.28	Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,
JOB.13.28	Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	Man that is born of a woman
JOB.14.1	Is of few days, and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
JOB.14.2	He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
JOB.14.3	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
JOB.14.3	And bringest me into judgement with thee?
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
JOB.14.5	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with thee,
JOB.14.5	And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
JOB.14.6	Look away from him, that he may rest,
JOB.14.6	Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day
JOB.14.7	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
JOB.14.8	And the stock thereof die in the ground;
JOB.14.9	Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
JOB.14.9	And put forth boughs like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dieth, and wasteth away:
JOB.14.10	Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	And the river decayeth and drieth up;
JOB.14.12	So man lieth down and riseth not:
JOB.14.12	Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
JOB.14.12	Nor be roused out of their sleep.
JOB.14.13	Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol,
JOB.14.13	That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
JOB.14.13	That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man die, shall he live 
JOB.14.14	All the days of my warfare would I wait,
JOB.14.14	Till my release should come.
JOB.14.15	Thou shouldest call, and I would answer thee:
JOB.14.15	Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thine hands
JOB.14.16	But now thou numberest my steps:
JOB.14.16	Dost thou not watch over my sin?
JOB.14.17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.
JOB.14.18	And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought,
JOB.14.18	And the rock is removed out of its place;
JOB.14.19	The waters wear the stones;
JOB.14.19	The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth:
JOB.14.19	And thou destroyest the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;
JOB.14.20	Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
JOB.14.21	And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
JOB.14.22	But his flesh upon him hath pain,
JOB.14.22	And his soul within him mourneth.
JOB.15.1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
JOB.15.2	Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge,
JOB.15.2	And fill his belly with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
JOB.15.3	Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	Yea, thou doest away with fear,
JOB.15.4	And restrainest devotion before God.
JOB.15.5	For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth,
JOB.15.5	And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;
JOB.15.6	Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
JOB.15.7	Art thou the first man that was born?
JOB.15.7	Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God?
JOB.15.8	And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
JOB.15.9	What knowest thou, that we know not?
JOB.15.9	What understandest thou, which is not in us?
JOB.15.10	With us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men,
JOB.15.10	Much elder than thy father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God too small for thee,
JOB.15.11	And the word 
JOB.15.12	Why doth thine heart carry thee away?
JOB.15.12	And why do thine eyes wink?
JOB.15.13	That thou turnest thy spirit against God,
JOB.15.13	And lettest 
JOB.15.14	What is man, that he should be clean?
JOB.15.14	And he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
JOB.15.15	Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones;
JOB.15.15	Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
JOB.15.16	How much less one that is abominable and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	A man that drinketh iniquity like water!
JOB.15.17	I will shew thee, hear thou me;
JOB.15.17	And that which I have seen I will declare:
JOB.15.18	(Which wise men have told
JOB.15.18	From their fathers, and have not hid it;
JOB.15.19	Unto whom alone the land was given,
JOB.15.19	And no stranger passed among them:)
JOB.15.20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,
JOB.15.20	Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
JOB.15.21	A sound of terrors is in his ears;
JOB.15.21	In prosperity the spoiler shall come upon him:
JOB.15.22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
JOB.15.22	And he is waited for of the sword:
JOB.15.23	He wandereth abroad for bread, 
JOB.15.23	He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand:
JOB.15.24	Distress and anguish make him afraid;
JOB.15.24	They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle:
JOB.15.25	Because he hath stretched out his hand against God,
JOB.15.25	And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;
JOB.15.26	He runneth upon him with a 
JOB.15.26	With the thick bosses of his bucklers:
JOB.15.27	Because he hath covered his face with his fatness,
JOB.15.27	And made collops of fat on his flanks;
JOB.15.28	And he hath dwelt in desolate cities,
JOB.15.28	In houses which no man inhabited,
JOB.15.28	Which were ready to become heaps.
JOB.15.29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
JOB.15.29	Neither shall their produce bend to the earth.
JOB.15.30	He shall not depart out of darkness;
JOB.15.30	The flame shall dry up his branches,
JOB.15.30	And by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
JOB.15.31	Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself:
JOB.15.31	For vanity shall be his recompence.
JOB.15.32	It shall be accomplished before his time,
JOB.15.32	And his branch shall not be green.
JOB.15.33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
JOB.15.33	And shall cast off his flower as the olive.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless shall be barren,
JOB.15.34	And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity,
JOB.15.35	And their belly prepareth deceit.
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.16.2	I have heard many such things:
JOB.16.2	Miserable comforters are ye all.
JOB.16.3	Shall vain words have an end?
JOB.16.3	Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as ye do;
JOB.16.4	If your soul were in my soul's stead,
JOB.16.4	I could join words together against you,
JOB.16.4	And shake mine head at you.
JOB.16.5	And the solace of my lips should assuage 
JOB.16.6	Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged:
JOB.16.6	And though I forbear, what am I eased?
JOB.16.7	But now he hath made me weary:
JOB.16.7	Thou hast made desolate all my company.
JOB.16.8	And thou hast laid fast hold on me, 
JOB.16.8	And my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.
JOB.16.9	He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me;
JOB.16.9	He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth:
JOB.16.9	Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
JOB.16.10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
JOB.16.10	They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully:
JOB.16.10	They gather themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God delivereth me to the ungodly,
JOB.16.11	And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;
JOB.16.12	Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:
JOB.16.12	He hath also set me up for his mark.
JOB.16.13	His archers compass me round about,
JOB.16.13	He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
JOB.16.13	He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach;
JOB.16.14	He runneth upon me like a giant.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
JOB.16.15	And have laid my horn in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is foul with weeping,
JOB.16.16	And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
JOB.16.17	Although there is no violence in mine hands,
JOB.16.17	And my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	O earth, cover not thou my blood,
JOB.16.18	And let my cry have no 
JOB.16.19	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
JOB.16.19	And he that coucheth for me is on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me:
JOB.16.21	That he would maintain the right of a man with God,
JOB.16.21	And of a son of man with his neighbour!
JOB.16.22	For when a few years are come,
JOB.16.22	I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
JOB.17.1	My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,
JOB.17.1	The grave is 
JOB.17.2	Surely there are mockers with me,
JOB.17.2	And mine eye abideth in their provocation.
JOB.17.3	Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself;
JOB.17.3	Who is there that will strike hands with me?
JOB.17.4	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
JOB.17.4	Therefore shalt thou not exalt 
JOB.17.5	He that denounceth his friends for a prey,
JOB.17.5	Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
JOB.17.6	He hath made me also a byword of the people;
JOB.17.6	And I am become an open abhorring.
JOB.17.7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
JOB.17.7	And all my members are as a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Upright men shall be astonied at this,
JOB.17.8	And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
JOB.17.9	Yet shall the righteous hold on his way,
JOB.17.9	And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger
JOB.17.10	But return ye, all of you, and come now:
JOB.17.10	And I shall not find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
JOB.17.11	Even the droughts of my heart.
JOB.17.12	They change the night into a day:
JOB.17.12	The fight, 
JOB.17.13	If I look for Sheol as mine house;
JOB.17.13	If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
JOB.17.14	If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father;
JOB.17.14	To the worm, 
JOB.17.15	Where then is my hope?
JOB.17.15	And as for my hope, who shall see it?
JOB.17.16	It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,
JOB.17.16	When once there is rest in the dust.
JOB.18.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.18.2	How long will ye lay snares for words?
JOB.18.2	Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
JOB.18.4	Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger,
JOB.18.4	Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
JOB.18.4	Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
JOB.18.5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
JOB.18.5	And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light shall be dark in his tent,
JOB.18.6	And his lamp above him shall be put out.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
JOB.18.7	And his own counsel shall cast him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
JOB.18.8	And he walketh upon the toils.
JOB.18.9	A gin shall take 
JOB.18.10	A noose is hid for him in the ground,
JOB.18.10	And a trap for him in the way
JOB.18.11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
JOB.18.11	And shall chase him at his heels.
JOB.18.12	His strength shall be hunger-bitten
JOB.18.12	And calamity shall be ready for his halting.
JOB.18.13	It shall devour the members of his body,
JOB.18.14	He shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth;
JOB.18.14	And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his:
JOB.18.15	Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots shall be dried up beneath,
JOB.18.16	And above shall his branch be cut off.
JOB.18.17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
JOB.18.17	And he shall have no name in the street.
JOB.18.18	He shall be driven from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	And chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He shall have neither son nor son's son among his people,
JOB.18.19	Nor any remaining where he sojourned.
JOB.18.20	They that come after shall be astonied at his day,
JOB.18.20	As they that went before were affrighted.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous,
JOB.18.21	And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.19.2	How long will ye vex my soul
JOB.19.2	And break me in pieces with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times have ye reproached me:
JOB.19.3	Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.
JOB.19.4	And be it indeed that I have erred,
JOB.19.4	Mine error remaineth with myself.
JOB.19.5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
JOB.19.5	And plead against me my reproach:
JOB.19.6	Know now that God hath subverted me 
JOB.19.6	And hath compassed me with his net.
JOB.19.7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
JOB.19.7	I cry for help, but there is no judgement
JOB.19.8	He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
JOB.19.8	And hath set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He hath stripped me of my glory,
JOB.19.9	And taken the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone:
JOB.19.10	And mine hope hath he plucked up like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
JOB.19.11	And he counteth me unto him as 
JOB.19.12	His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me,
JOB.19.12	And encamp round about my tent.
JOB.19.13	He hath put my brethren far from me,
JOB.19.13	And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My kinsfolk have failed,
JOB.19.14	And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger:
JOB.19.15	I am an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer,
JOB.19.17	My breath is strange to my wife,
JOB.19.17	And my supplication to the children of my 
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me;
JOB.19.18	If I arise, they speak against me.
JOB.19.19	All my inward friends abhor me:
JOB.19.19	And they whom I loved are turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
JOB.19.20	And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
JOB.19.21	For the hand of God hath touched me.
JOB.19.22	Why do ye persecute me as God,
JOB.19.22	And are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	Oh that my words were now written!
JOB.19.23	Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That with an iron pen and lead
JOB.19.24	They were graven in the rock for ever!
JOB.19.25	But I know that my redeemer liveth,
JOB.19.25	And that he shall stand up at the last upon the earth:
JOB.19.26	And after my skin hath been thus destroyed,
JOB.19.26	Yet from my flesh shall I see God:
JOB.19.27	Whom I shall see for myself,
JOB.19.27	And mine eyes shall behold, and not another.
JOB.19.27	My reins are consumed within me.
JOB.19.28	If ye say, How we will persecute him!
JOB.19.28	Seeing that the root of the matter is found in me;
JOB.19.29	Be ye afraid of the sword:
JOB.19.29	For wrath 
JOB.19.29	That ye may know there is a judgement.
JOB.20.1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
JOB.20.2	Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,
JOB.20.2	Even by reason of my haste that is in me.
JOB.20.3	I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame,
JOB.20.3	And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.
JOB.20.4	Knowest thou 
JOB.20.4	Since man was placed upon earth,
JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	And the joy of the godless but for a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
JOB.20.6	And his head reach unto the clouds;
JOB.20.7	Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:
JOB.20.7	They which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
JOB.20.8	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
JOB.20.8	Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye which saw him shall see him no more;
JOB.20.9	Neither shall his place any more behold him
JOB.20.10	His children shall seek the favour of the poor,
JOB.20.10	And his hands shall give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of his youth,
JOB.20.11	But it shall lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
JOB.20.12	Though he hide it under his tongue;
JOB.20.13	Though he spare it, and will not let it go,
JOB.20.13	But keep it still within his mouth;
JOB.20.14	Yet his meat in his bowels is turned,
JOB.20.14	It is the gall of asps within him.
JOB.20.15	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:
JOB.20.15	God shall cast them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He shall suck the poison of asps:
JOB.20.16	The viper's tongue shall slay him.
JOB.20.17	He shall not look upon the rivers,
JOB.20.17	The flowing streams of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down;
JOB.20.18	According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.
JOB.20.19	For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor;
JOB.20.19	He hath violently taken away an house, and he shall not build it up.
JOB.20.20	Because he knew no quietness within him,
JOB.20.20	He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.
JOB.20.21	There was nothing left that he devoured not;
JOB.20.21	Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
JOB.20.22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
JOB.20.22	The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him
JOB.20.23	When he is about to fill his belly,
JOB.20.23	And shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
JOB.20.24	He shall flee from the iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	And the bow of brass shall strike him through.
JOB.20.25	He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body:
JOB.20.25	Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall;
JOB.20.25	Terrors are upon him.
JOB.20.26	All darkness is laid up for his treasures:
JOB.20.26	A fire not blown 
JOB.20.26	It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,
JOB.20.27	And the earth shall rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house shall depart,
JOB.20.29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
JOB.20.29	And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.21.2	Hear diligently my speech;
JOB.21.2	And let this be your consolations.
JOB.21.3	Suffer me, and I also will speak;
JOB.21.3	And after that I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint to man?
JOB.21.4	And why should I not be impatient?
JOB.21.5	Mark me, and be astonished,
JOB.21.5	And lay your hand upon your mouth.
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember I am troubled,
JOB.21.6	And horror taketh hold on my flesh
JOB.21.7	Wherefore do the wicked live,
JOB.21.7	Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their seed is established with them in their sight,
JOB.21.8	And their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear,
JOB.21.9	Neither is the rod of God upon them.
JOB.21.10	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
JOB.21.10	Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock,
JOB.21.11	And their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the timbrel and harp,
JOB.21.12	And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity,
JOB.21.13	And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
JOB.21.14	Yet they said unto God, Depart from us;
JOB.21.14	For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
JOB.21.15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
JOB.21.15	And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
JOB.21.16	Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand:
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me
JOB.21.17	How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?
JOB.21.17	That their calamity cometh upon them?
JOB.21.17	That 
JOB.21.18	That they are as stubble before the wind,
JOB.21.18	And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?
JOB.21.19	Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.
JOB.21.20	Let his own eyes see his destruction,
JOB.21.20	And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him,
JOB.21.21	When the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
JOB.21.22	Shall any teach God knowledge?
JOB.21.22	Seeing he judgeth those that are high.
JOB.21.23	One dieth in his full strength,
JOB.21.23	Being wholly at ease and quiet:
JOB.21.24	His breasts are full of milk,
JOB.21.24	And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
JOB.21.25	And another dieth in bitterness of soul,
JOB.21.25	And never tasteth of good.
JOB.21.26	They lie down alike in the dust,
JOB.21.26	And the worm covereth them
JOB.21.27	Behold, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
JOB.21.28	For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?
JOB.21.28	And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
JOB.21.29	Have ye not asked them that go by the way?
JOB.21.29	And do ye not know their tokens?
JOB.21.30	That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?
JOB.21.30	That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
JOB.21.31	Who shall declare his way to his face?
JOB.21.31	And who shall repay him what he hath done?
JOB.21.32	Yet shall he be borne to the grave,
JOB.21.32	And shall keep watch over the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
JOB.21.33	And all men shall draw after him,
JOB.21.33	As there were innumerable before him.
JOB.21.34	How then comfort ye me in vain,
JOB.21.34	Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?
JOB.22.1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
JOB.22.2	Can a man be profitable unto God?
JOB.22.2	Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure to the
JOB.22.3	Almighty, that thou art righteous?
JOB.22.3	Or is it gain 
JOB.22.4	Is it for thy fear 
JOB.22.4	That he entereth with thee into judgement?
JOB.22.5	Is not thy wickedness great?
JOB.22.5	Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
JOB.22.6	For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,
JOB.22.6	And stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
JOB.22.7	And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
JOB.22.8	And the honourable man, he dwelt in it.
JOB.22.9	Thou hast sent widows away empty,
JOB.22.9	And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares are round about thee,
JOB.22.10	And sudden fear troubleth thee,
JOB.22.11	Or darkness, that thou canst not see,
JOB.22.11	And abundance of waters cover thee.
JOB.22.12	Is not God in the height of heaven?
JOB.22.12	And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	And thou sayest, What doth God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge through the thick darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not;
JOB.22.14	And he walketh in the circuit of heaven
JOB.22.15	Wilt thou keep the old way which
JOB.22.15	Wicked men have trodden?
JOB.22.16	Who were snatched away before their time,
JOB.22.16	Whose foundation was poured out as a stream:
JOB.22.17	Who said unto God, Depart from us;
JOB.22.17	And, What can the Almighty do for us?
JOB.22.18	Yet he fired their houses with good things:
JOB.22.18	But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see it, and are glad;
JOB.22.19	And the innocent laugh them to scorn:
JOB.22.20	And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed
JOB.22.21	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:
JOB.22.21	Thereby good shall come unto thee.
JOB.22.22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	And lay up his words in thine heart.
JOB.22.23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up;
JOB.22.23	If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.
JOB.22.24	And lay thou 
JOB.22.24	And 
JOB.22.25	And the Almighty shall be thy treasure,
JOB.22.25	And precious silver unto thee.
JOB.22.26	For then shalt thou delight thyself in the
JOB.22.26	Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
JOB.22.27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee;
JOB.22.27	And thou shalt pay thy vows.
JOB.22.28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee;
JOB.22.28	And light shall shine upon thy ways.
JOB.22.29	When they cast 
JOB.22.29	And the humble person he shall save.
JOB.22.30	He shall deliver 
JOB.22.30	Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thine hands.
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.23.2	Even today is my complaint rebellious:
JOB.23.2	My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh that I knew where I might find him,
JOB.23.3	That I might come even to his seat!
JOB.23.4	I would order my cause before him,
JOB.23.4	And fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would know the words which he would answer me,
JOB.23.5	And understand what he would say unto me.
JOB.23.6	Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
JOB.23.6	Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
JOB.23.7	There the upright might reason with him;
JOB.23.7	So should I be delivered for ever from my judge
JOB.23.8	Behold, I go forward, but he is not 
JOB.23.8	And backward, but I cannot perceive him:
JOB.23.9	On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
JOB.23.9	He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
JOB.23.10	But he knoweth the way that I take;
JOB.23.10	When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
JOB.23.11	My foot hath held fast to his steps;
JOB.23.11	His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food
JOB.23.13	But he is in one 
JOB.23.13	And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
JOB.23.14	For he performeth that which is appointed for me:
JOB.23.14	And many such things are with him.
JOB.23.15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence;
JOB.23.15	When I consider, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	For God hath made my heart faint, and the
JOB.23.16	Almighty hath troubled me:
JOB.23.17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
JOB.23.17	Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
JOB.24.1	Why are times not laid up by the Almighty?
JOB.24.1	And why do not they which know him see his days?
JOB.24.2	There are that remove the landmarks;
JOB.24.2	They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
JOB.24.3	They take the widow's ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy out of the way:
JOB.24.4	The poor of the earth hide themselves together.
JOB.24.5	Behold, as wild asses in the desert
JOB.24.5	They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for meat;
JOB.24.5	The wilderness 
JOB.24.6	They cut their provender in the field;
JOB.24.6	And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They lie all night naked without clothing,
JOB.24.7	And have no covering in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
JOB.24.8	And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
JOB.24.9	There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast,
JOB.24.9	And take a pledge of the poor:
JOB.24.10	And being an-hungred they carry the sheaves;
JOB.24.11	They make oil within the walls of these men;
JOB.24.11	They tread 
JOB.24.12	From out of the populous city men groan,
JOB.24.12	And the soul of the wounded crieth out:
JOB.24.12	Yet God imputeth it not for folly
JOB.24.13	These are of them that rebel against the light;
JOB.24.13	They know not the ways thereof,
JOB.24.13	Nor abide in the paths thereof.
JOB.24.14	The murderer riseth with the light, he killeth the poor and needy;
JOB.24.14	And in the night he is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	Saying, No eye shall see me:
JOB.24.15	And he disguiseth his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses:
JOB.24.16	They shut themselves up in the daytime;
JOB.24.16	They know not the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is to all of them as the shadow of death;
JOB.24.17	For they know the terrors of the shadow of death
JOB.24.18	He is swift upon the face of the waters;
JOB.24.18	Their portion is cursed in the earth:
JOB.24.18	He turneth not by the way of the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
JOB.24.20	The womb shall forget him;
JOB.24.20	The worm shall feed sweetly on him;
JOB.24.20	He shall be no more remembered:
JOB.24.20	And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
JOB.24.21	He devoureth the barren that beareth not;
JOB.24.21	And doeth not good to the widow.
JOB.24.22	He draweth away the mighty also by his power:
JOB.24.22	He riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
JOB.24.23	And his eyes are upon their ways.
JOB.24.24	They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone;
JOB.24.24	Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all other,
JOB.24.24	And are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
JOB.24.25	And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,
JOB.24.25	And make my speech nothing worth?
JOB.25.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.25.2	Dominion and fear are with him;
JOB.25.2	He maketh peace in his high places.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number of his armies?
JOB.25.3	And upon whom doth not his light arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be just with God?
JOB.25.4	Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
JOB.25.5	Behold, even the moon hath no brightness,
JOB.25.5	And the stars are not pure in his sight:
JOB.25.6	How much less man, that is a worm!
JOB.25.6	And the son of man, which is a worm!
JOB.26.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.26.2	How hast thou helped him that is without power!
JOB.26.2	How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
JOB.26.3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,
JOB.26.3	And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
JOB.26.4	To whom hast thou uttered words?
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit came forth from thee?
JOB.26.5	They that are deceased tremble
JOB.26.5	Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
JOB.26.6	Sheol is naked before him,
JOB.26.6	And Abaddon hath no covering.
JOB.26.7	He stretcheth out the north over empty space,
JOB.26.7	And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
JOB.26.8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
JOB.26.8	And the cloud is not rent under them.
JOB.26.9	He closeth in the face of his throne,
JOB.26.9	And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
JOB.26.10	He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters,
JOB.26.10	Unto the confines of light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble
JOB.26.11	And are astonished at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	He stirreth up the sea with his power,
JOB.26.12	And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
JOB.26.13	By his spirit the heavens are garnished;
JOB.26.13	His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.
JOB.26.14	Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways:
JOB.26.14	And how small a whisper do we hear of him!
JOB.26.14	But the thunder of his power who can understand?
JOB.27.1	And Job again took up his parable, and said,
JOB.27.2	As God liveth, who hath taken away my right;
JOB.27.2	And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
JOB.27.3	(For my life is yet whole in me,
JOB.27.3	And the spirit of God is in my nostrils;)
JOB.27.4	Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,
JOB.27.4	Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	God forbid that I should justify you:
JOB.27.5	Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:
JOB.27.6	My heart shall not reproach 
JOB.27.7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
JOB.27.7	And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain,
JOB.27.8	When God taketh away his soul?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry,
JOB.27.9	When trouble cometh upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the
JOB.27.10	Almighty, and call upon God at all times?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you concerning the hand of God;
JOB.27.11	That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
JOB.27.12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
JOB.27.12	Why then are ye become altogether vain?
JOB.27.13	This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
JOB.27.13	And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword;
JOB.27.14	And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death,
JOB.27.15	And his widows shall make no lamentation.
JOB.27.16	Though he heap up silver as the dust,
JOB.27.16	And prepare raiment as the clay;
JOB.27.17	He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
JOB.27.17	And the innocent shall divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He buildeth his house as the moth,
JOB.27.18	And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
JOB.27.19	He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered;
JOB.27.19	He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like waters;
JOB.27.20	A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth;
JOB.27.21	And it sweepeth him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For 
JOB.27.22	He would fain flee out of his hand.
JOB.27.23	Men shall clap their hands at him,
JOB.27.23	And shall hiss him out of his place.
JOB.28.1	Surely there is a mine for silver,
JOB.28.1	And a place for gold which they refine.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth,
JOB.28.2	And brass is molten out of the stone.
JOB.28.3	And searcheth out to the furthest bound
JOB.28.3	The stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death.
JOB.28.4	He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn;
JOB.28.4	They are forgotten of the foot 
JOB.28.4	They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
JOB.28.5	As for the earth, out of it cometh bread:
JOB.28.5	And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
JOB.28.6	The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,
JOB.28.6	And it hath dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	That path no bird of prey knoweth,
JOB.28.7	Neither hath the falcon's eye seen it:
JOB.28.8	The proud beasts have not trodden it,
JOB.28.8	Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.
JOB.28.9	He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock;
JOB.28.9	He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cutteth out channels among the rocks;
JOB.28.10	And his eye seeth every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;
JOB.28.11	And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
JOB.28.12	But where shall wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man knoweth not the price thereof;
JOB.28.13	Neither is it found in the land of the living
JOB.28.14	The deep saith, It is not in me:
JOB.28.14	And the sea saith, It is not with me.
JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for gold,
JOB.28.15	Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
JOB.28.17	Gold and glass cannot equal it:
JOB.28.17	Neither shall the exchange thereof be jewels of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal:
JOB.28.18	Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
JOB.28.19	Neither shall it be valued with pure gold
JOB.28.20	Whence then cometh wisdom?
JOB.28.20	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
JOB.28.21	And kept close from the fowls of the air.
JOB.28.22	Destruction and Death say,
JOB.28.22	We have heard a rumour thereof with our ears.
JOB.28.23	God understandeth the way thereof,
JOB.28.23	And he knoweth the place thereof.
JOB.28.24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
JOB.28.24	And seeth under the whole heaven;
JOB.28.25	To make a weight for the wind;
JOB.28.25	Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.
JOB.28.26	When he made a decree for the rain,
JOB.28.26	And a way for the lightning of the thunder:
JOB.28.27	Then did he see it, and declare it;
JOB.28.27	He established it, yea, and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And unto man he said,
JOB.28.28	Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
JOB.28.28	And to depart from evil is understanding.
JOB.29.1	And Job again took up his parable, and said,
JOB.29.2	Oh that I were as in the months of old,
JOB.29.2	As in the days when God watched over me;
JOB.29.3	When his lamp shined upon my head,
JOB.29.3	And by his light I walked through darkness;
JOB.29.4	As I was in the ripeness of my days,
JOB.29.4	When the secret of God was upon my tent;
JOB.29.5	When the Almighty was yet with me,
JOB.29.5	And my children were about me;
JOB.29.6	When my steps were washed with butter,
JOB.29.6	And the rock poured me out rivers of oil!
JOB.29.7	When I went forth to the gate unto the city,
JOB.29.7	When I prepared my seat in the street,
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me and hid themselves,
JOB.29.8	And the aged rose up and stood;
JOB.29.9	The princes refrained talking,
JOB.29.9	And laid their hand on their mouth;
JOB.29.10	The voice of the nobles was hushed,
JOB.29.10	And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	For when the ear heard 
JOB.29.11	And when the eye saw 
JOB.29.12	Because I delivered the poor that cried,
JOB.29.12	The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
JOB.29.13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
JOB.29.13	And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
JOB.29.14	My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind,
JOB.29.15	And feet was I to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy:
JOB.29.16	And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
JOB.29.17	And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous,
JOB.29.17	And plucked the prey out of his teeth
JOB.29.18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
JOB.29.18	And I shall multiply my days as the sand:
JOB.29.19	My root is spread out to the waters,
JOB.29.19	And the dew lieth all night upon my branch:
JOB.29.20	My glory is fresh in me,
JOB.29.20	And my bow is renewed in my hand.
JOB.29.21	Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
JOB.29.21	And kept silence for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they spake not again;
JOB.29.22	And my speech dropped upon them.
JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the rain;
JOB.29.23	And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
JOB.29.24	If I laughed on them, they believed 
JOB.29.24	And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
JOB.29.25	I chose out their way, and sat 
JOB.29.25	And dwelt as a king in the army,
JOB.29.25	As one that comforteth the mourners.
JOB.30.1	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
JOB.30.1	Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me?
JOB.30.2	Men in whom ripe age is perished.
JOB.30.3	They are gaunt with want and famine;
JOB.30.3	They gnaw the dry ground; in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
JOB.30.4	They pluck salt-wort by the bushes;
JOB.30.4	And the roots of the broom 
JOB.30.5	They are driven forth from the midst 
JOB.30.5	They cry after them as after a thief.
JOB.30.6	In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell,
JOB.30.6	In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they bray;
JOB.30.7	Under the nettles they are gathered together.
JOB.30.8	They were scourged out of the land.
JOB.30.9	And now I am become their song,
JOB.30.9	Yea, I am a byword unto them.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,
JOB.30.10	And spare not to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me,
JOB.30.11	And they have cast off the bridle before me.
JOB.30.12	Upon my right hand rise the rabble;
JOB.30.12	They thrust aside my feet,
JOB.30.12	And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
JOB.30.13	They mar my path,
JOB.30.13	They set forward my calamity,
JOB.30.14	As through a wide breach they come
JOB.30.14	In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves 
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me,
JOB.30.15	They chase mine honour as the wind;
JOB.30.15	And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.
JOB.30.16	And now my soul is poured out within me;
JOB.30.16	Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
JOB.30.17	In the night season my bones are pierced in me,
JOB.30.17	And the 
JOB.30.18	By the great force 
JOB.30.18	It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He hath cast me into the mire,
JOB.30.19	And I am become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me:
JOB.30.20	I stand up, and thou lookest at me.
JOB.30.21	Thou art turned to be cruel to me:
JOB.30.21	With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.
JOB.30.22	Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride 
JOB.30.22	And thou dissolvest me in the storm.
JOB.30.23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
JOB.30.23	And to the house appointed for all living.
JOB.30.24	Surely against a ruinous heap he will not put forth his hand;
JOB.30.24	Though 
JOB.30.25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
JOB.30.25	Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	When I looked for good, then evil came;
JOB.30.26	And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
JOB.30.27	My bowels boil, and rest not;
JOB.30.27	Days of affliction are come upon me.
JOB.30.28	I go mourning without the sun:
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	I am a brother to jackals,
JOB.30.29	And a companion to ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin is black, 
JOB.30.30	And my bones are burned with heat.
JOB.30.31	Therefore is my harp 
JOB.30.31	And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
JOB.31.1	I made a covenant with mine eyes;
JOB.31.1	how then should I look upon a maid?
JOB.31.2	For what 
JOB.31.2	And the heritage of the Almighty from on high?
JOB.31.3	Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
JOB.31.3	And disaster to the workers of iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Doth not he see my ways,
JOB.31.4	And number all my steps?
JOB.31.5	If I have walked with vanity,
JOB.31.5	And my foot hath hasted to deceit;
JOB.31.6	(Let me be weighed in an even balance,
JOB.31.6	That God may know mine integrity;)
JOB.31.7	If my step hath turned out of the way,
JOB.31.7	And mine heart walked after mine eyes,
JOB.31.7	And if any spot hath cleaved to mine hands:
JOB.31.8	Then let me sow, and let another eat;
JOB.31.8	Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out
JOB.31.9	If mine heart have been enticed unto a woman,
JOB.31.9	And I have laid wait at my neighbour's door:
JOB.31.10	Then let my wife grind unto another,
JOB.31.10	And let others bow down upon her.
JOB.31.11	For that were an heinous crime;
JOB.31.11	Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:
JOB.31.12	For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction,
JOB.31.12	And would root out all mine increase.
JOB.31.13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant,
JOB.31.13	When they contended with me:
JOB.31.14	What then shall I do when God riseth up?
JOB.31.14	And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
JOB.31.15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
JOB.31.15	And did not one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	If I have withheld the poor from 
JOB.31.16	Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
JOB.31.17	Or have eaten my morsel alone,
JOB.31.17	And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
JOB.31.18	(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
JOB.31.18	And I have been her guide from my mother's womb;)
JOB.31.19	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
JOB.31.19	Or that the needy had no covering;
JOB.31.20	If his loins have not blessed me,
JOB.31.20	And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
JOB.31.21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
JOB.31.21	Because I saw my help in the gate:
JOB.31.22	Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,
JOB.31.22	And mine arm be broken from the bone.
JOB.31.23	For calamity from God was a terror to me,
JOB.31.23	And by reason of his excellency I could do nothing
JOB.31.24	If I have made gold my hope,
JOB.31.24	And have said to the fine gold, 
JOB.31.25	If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,
JOB.31.25	And because mine hand had gotten much;
JOB.31.26	If I beheld the sun when it shined,
JOB.31.26	Or the moon walking in brightness;
JOB.31.27	And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	And my mouth hath kissed my hand:
JOB.31.28	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:
JOB.31.28	For I should have lied to God that is above.
JOB.31.29	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
JOB.31.29	Or lifted up myself when evil found him;
JOB.31.30	(Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	By asking his life with a curse;)
JOB.31.31	If the men of my tent said not,
JOB.31.31	Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his flesh?
JOB.31.32	The stranger did not lodge in the street;
JOB.31.32	But I opened my doors to the traveller;
JOB.31.33	If like Adam I covered my transgressions,
JOB.31.33	By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom;
JOB.31.34	Because I feared the great multitude,
JOB.31.34	And the contempt of families terrified me,
JOB.31.34	So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door--
JOB.31.35	Oh that I had one to hear me!
JOB.31.35	(Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me;)
JOB.31.35	And 
JOB.31.36	Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;
JOB.31.36	I would bind it unto me as a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
JOB.31.37	As a prince would I go near unto him.
JOB.31.38	If my land cry out against me,
JOB.31.38	And the furrows thereof weep together;
JOB.31.39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
JOB.31.39	Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
JOB.31.40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	And cockle instead of barley.
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: Against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he. 
JOB.32.5	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled
JOB.32.6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,
JOB.32.6	I am young, and ye are very old;
JOB.32.6	Wherefore I held back, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
JOB.32.7	I said, Days should speak,
JOB.32.7	And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But there is a spirit in man,
JOB.32.8	And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
JOB.32.9	It is not the great that are wise,
JOB.32.9	Nor the aged that understand judgement.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
JOB.32.10	I also will shew mine opinion.
JOB.32.11	Behold, I waited for your words,
JOB.32.11	I listened for your reasons,
JOB.32.11	Whilst ye searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	Yea, I attended unto you,
JOB.32.12	And, behold, there was none that convinced Job,
JOB.32.12	Or that answered his words, among you.
JOB.32.13	Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	God may vanquish him, not man:
JOB.32.14	For he hath not directed his words against me;
JOB.32.14	Neither will I answer him with your speeches
JOB.32.15	They are amazed, they answer no more:
JOB.32.15	They have not a word to say.
JOB.32.16	And shall I wait, because they speak not,
JOB.32.16	Because they stand still, and answer no more?
JOB.32.17	I also will answer my part,
JOB.32.17	I also will shew mine opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words;
JOB.32.18	The spirit within me constraineth me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent;
JOB.32.19	Like new bottles it is ready to burst.
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed;
JOB.32.20	I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person;
JOB.32.21	Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.
JOB.32.22	For I know not to give flattering titles;
JOB.33.1	Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech,
JOB.33.1	And hearken to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Behold now, I have opened my mouth,
JOB.33.2	My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My words 
JOB.33.3	And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
JOB.33.4	The spirit of God hath made me,
JOB.33.4	And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.
JOB.33.5	If thou canst, answer thou me;
JOB.33.5	Set 
JOB.33.6	Behold, I am toward God even as thou art:
JOB.33.6	I also am formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
JOB.33.7	Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee
JOB.33.8	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
JOB.33.8	And I have heard the voice of 
JOB.33.9	I am clean, without transgression;
JOB.33.9	I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:
JOB.33.10	Behold, he findeth occasions against me,
JOB.33.10	He counteth me for his enemy;
JOB.33.11	He putteth my feet in the stocks,
JOB.33.11	He marketh all my paths.
JOB.33.12	Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just;
JOB.33.12	For God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why dost thou strive against him?
JOB.33.13	For he giveth not account of any of his matters
JOB.33.14	For God speaketh once,
JOB.33.14	Yea twice, 
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	When deep sleep falleth upon men,
JOB.33.15	In slumberings upon the bed;
JOB.33.16	Then he openeth the ears of men,
JOB.33.16	And sealeth their instruction,
JOB.33.17	That he may withdraw man 
JOB.33.17	And hide pride from man;
JOB.33.18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.18	And his life from perishing by the sword
JOB.33.19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
JOB.33.19	And with continual strife in his bones:
JOB.33.20	So that his life abhorreth bread,
JOB.33.20	And his soul dainty meat.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
JOB.33.21	And his bones that were not seen stick out.
JOB.33.22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit,
JOB.33.22	And his life to the destroyers.
JOB.33.23	If there be with him an angel,
JOB.33.23	An interpreter, one among a thousand,
JOB.33.23	To shew unto man what is right for him;
JOB.33.24	Then he is gracious unto him, and saith,
JOB.33.24	Deliver him from going down to the pit,
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom.
JOB.33.25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's;
JOB.33.25	He returneth to the days of his youth:
JOB.33.26	He prayeth unto God, and he is favourable unto him;
JOB.33.26	So that he seeth his face with joy:
JOB.33.26	And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.
JOB.33.27	He singeth before men, and saith,
JOB.33.27	I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
JOB.33.27	And it profited me not:
JOB.33.28	He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit,
JOB.33.28	And my life shall behold the light
JOB.33.29	Lo, all these things doth God work,
JOB.33.29	Twice, 
JOB.33.30	To bring back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.30	That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:
JOB.33.31	Hold thy peace, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If thou hast any thing to say, answer me:
JOB.33.32	Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
JOB.33.33	If not, hearken thou unto me:
JOB.33.33	Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
JOB.34.1	Moreover Elihu answered and said,
JOB.34.2	Hear my words, ye wise men;
JOB.34.2	And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear trieth words,
JOB.34.3	As the palate tasteth meat.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose for us that which is right:
JOB.34.4	Let us know among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job hath said, I am righteous,
JOB.34.5	And God hath taken away my right:
JOB.34.6	Notwithstanding my right I am 
JOB.34.6	My wound is incurable, 
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job,
JOB.34.7	Who drinketh up scorning like water?
JOB.34.8	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
JOB.34.8	And walketh with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	For he hath said, it profiteth a man nothing
JOB.34.9	That he should delight himself with God
JOB.34.10	Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
JOB.34.10	Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness;
JOB.34.10	And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
JOB.34.11	For the work of a man shall he render unto him,
JOB.34.11	And cause every man to find according to his ways.
JOB.34.12	Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,
JOB.34.12	Neither will the Almighty pervert judgement.
JOB.34.13	Who gave him a charge over the earth?
JOB.34.13	Or who hath disposed the whole world?
JOB.34.14	If he set his heart upon man,
JOB.34.15	All flesh shall perish together,
JOB.34.15	And man shall turn again unto dust
JOB.34.16	If now 
JOB.34.16	Hearken to the voice of my words.
JOB.34.17	Shall even one that hateth right govern?
JOB.34.17	And wilt thou condemn him that is just 
JOB.34.18	Is it 
JOB.34.19	Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?
JOB.34.19	For they all are the work of his hands.
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die, even at midnight;
JOB.34.20	The people are shaken and pass away,
JOB.34.20	And the mighty are taken away without hand.
JOB.34.21	For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,
JOB.34.21	And he seeth all his goings.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,
JOB.34.22	Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For he needeth not further to consider a man,
JOB.34.23	That he should go before God in judgement.
JOB.34.24	He breaketh in pieces mighty men 
JOB.34.24	And setteth others in their stead.
JOB.34.25	Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;
JOB.34.25	And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
JOB.34.26	He striketh them as wicked men
JOB.34.26	In the open sight of others;
JOB.34.27	Because they turned aside from following him,
JOB.34.27	And would not have regard to any of his ways:
JOB.34.28	So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him,
JOB.34.28	And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn?
JOB.34.29	And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
JOB.34.29	Whether 
JOB.34.30	That the godless man reign not,
JOB.34.30	That there be none to ensnare the people
JOB.34.31	For hath any said unto God, I have borne 
JOB.34.31	I will not offend 
JOB.34.32	That which I see not teach thou me
JOB.34.32	If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
JOB.34.33	Shall his recompence be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it?
JOB.34.33	For thou must choose, and not I:
JOB.34.33	Therefore speak what thou knowest.
JOB.34.34	Men of understanding will say unto me,
JOB.34.34	Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
JOB.34.35	Job speaketh without knowledge,
JOB.34.35	And his words are without wisdom.
JOB.34.36	Would that Job were tried unto the end,
JOB.34.36	Because of his answering like wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,
JOB.34.37	He clappeth his hands among us,
JOB.34.37	And multiplieth his words against God.
JOB.35.1	Moreover Elihu answered and said,
JOB.35.2	Thinkest thou this to be 
JOB.35.3	That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee?
JOB.35.4	I will answer thee,
JOB.35.4	And thy companions with thee.
JOB.35.5	Look unto the heavens, and see;
JOB.35.5	And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
JOB.35.6	If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him?
JOB.35.6	And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him.
JOB.35.7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?
JOB.35.7	Or what receiveth he of thine hand?
JOB.35.8	Thy wickedness 
JOB.35.8	And thy righteousness 
JOB.35.9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
JOB.35.9	They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But none saith, Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	Who giveth songs in the night;
JOB.35.11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
JOB.35.11	And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
JOB.35.12	There they cry, but none giveth answer,
JOB.35.12	Because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not hear vanity,
JOB.35.13	Neither will the Almighty regard it
JOB.35.14	How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not,
JOB.35.14	The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!
JOB.35.15	But now, because he hath not visited in his anger,
JOB.35.15	Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;
JOB.35.16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity;
JOB.35.16	He multiplieth words without knowledge.
JOB.36.1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
JOB.36.2	Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee:
JOB.36.2	For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
JOB.36.3	And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words are not false:
JOB.36.4	One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee
JOB.36.5	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:
JOB.36.5	He is mighty in strength of understanding.
JOB.36.6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
JOB.36.6	But giveth to the afflicted 
JOB.36.7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
JOB.36.7	But with kings upon the throne
JOB.36.7	He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if they be bound in fetters,
JOB.36.8	And be taken in the cords of affliction;
JOB.36.9	Then he sheweth them their work,
JOB.36.9	And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
JOB.36.10	He openeth also their ear to instruction,
JOB.36.10	And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they hearken and serve 
JOB.36.11	They shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
JOB.36.12	But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword,
JOB.36.12	And they shall die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But they that are godless in heart lay up anger:
JOB.36.13	They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth,
JOB.36.14	And their life 
JOB.36.15	He delivereth the afflicted by his affliction,
JOB.36.15	And openeth their ear in oppression.
JOB.36.16	Yea, he would have led thee away out of distress
JOB.36.16	Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
JOB.36.16	And that which is set on thy table should be full of fatness.
JOB.36.17	But thou art full of the judgement of the wicked:
JOB.36.17	Judgement and justice take hold 
JOB.36.18	Because there is wrath, beware lest thou be led away by 
JOB.36.18	Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
JOB.36.19	Will thy riches suffice, 
JOB.36.19	Or all the forces of 
JOB.36.20	Desire not the night,
JOB.36.20	When peoples are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, regard not iniquity:
JOB.36.21	For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God doeth loftily in his power:
JOB.36.22	Who is a teacher like unto him?
JOB.36.23	Who hath enjoined him his way?
JOB.36.23	Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?
JOB.36.24	Remember that thou magnify his work,
JOB.36.24	Whereof men have sung.
JOB.36.25	All men have looked thereon;
JOB.36.25	Man beholdeth it afar off.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not;
JOB.36.26	The number of his years is unsearchable.
JOB.36.27	For he draweth up the drops of water,
JOB.36.27	Which distil in rain from his vapour:
JOB.36.28	Which the skies pour down
JOB.36.28	And drop upon man abundantly.
JOB.36.29	Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
JOB.36.29	The thunderings of his pavilion?
JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreadeth his light around him;
JOB.36.30	And he covereth the bottom of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by these he judgeth the peoples;
JOB.36.31	He giveth meat in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covereth his hands with the lightning;
JOB.36.32	And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
JOB.36.33	The noise thereof telleth concerning him,
JOB.36.33	The cattle also concerning 
JOB.37.1	At this also my heart trembleth,
JOB.37.1	And is moved out of its place.
JOB.37.2	Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice,
JOB.37.2	And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,
JOB.37.3	And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it a voice roareth;
JOB.37.4	He thundereth with the voice of his majesty:
JOB.37.4	And he stayeth them not when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thundereth marvelously with his voice;
JOB.37.5	Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend
JOB.37.6	For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth;
JOB.37.6	Likewise to the shower of rain,
JOB.37.6	And to the showers of his mighty rain.
JOB.37.7	He sealeth up the hand of every man;
JOB.37.7	That all men whom he hath made may know 
JOB.37.8	Then the beasts go into coverts,
JOB.37.8	And remain in their dens.
JOB.37.9	Out of the chamber 
JOB.37.9	And cold out of the north.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God ice is given:
JOB.37.10	And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
JOB.37.11	Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture;
JOB.37.11	He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
JOB.37.12	And it is turned round about by his guidance,
JOB.37.12	That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
JOB.37.12	Upon the face of the habitable world.
JOB.37.13	Whether it be for correction, or for his land,
JOB.37.13	Or for mercy, that he cause it to come
JOB.37.14	Hearken unto this, O Job:
JOB.37.14	Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
JOB.37.15	Dost thou know how God layeth 
JOB.37.15	And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
JOB.37.16	The wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
JOB.37.17	How thy garments are warm,
JOB.37.17	When the earth is still by reason of the south 
JOB.37.18	Canst thou with him spread out the sky,
JOB.37.18	Which is strong as a molten mirror?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we shall say unto him;
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told him that I would speak?
JOB.37.20	Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
JOB.37.21	And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies:
JOB.37.21	But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
JOB.37.22	Out of the north cometh golden splendour:
JOB.37.22	God hath upon him terrible majesty.
JOB.37.23	And in judgement and plenteous justice he will not afflict.
JOB.37.24	Men do therefore fear him:
JOB.37.24	He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	Who is this that darkeneth counsel
JOB.38.2	By words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Gird up now thy loins like a man;
JOB.38.3	For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me
JOB.38.4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Declare, if thou hast understanding.
JOB.38.5	Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
JOB.38.5	Or who stretched the line upon it?
JOB.38.6	Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?
JOB.38.6	Or who laid the corner stone thereof;
JOB.38.7	When the morning stars sang together,
JOB.38.7	And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	When it brake forth, 
JOB.38.9	When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
JOB.38.9	And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
JOB.38.10	And prescribed for it my decree,
JOB.38.10	And set bars and doors,
JOB.38.11	And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;
JOB.38.11	And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
JOB.38.12	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days 
JOB.38.13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
JOB.38.13	And the wicked be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is changed as clay under the seal;
JOB.38.14	And 
JOB.38.15	And from the wicked their light is withholden,
JOB.38.15	And the high arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
JOB.38.16	Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee?
JOB.38.17	Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
JOB.38.18	Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Declare, if thou knowest it all.
JOB.38.19	Where is the way to the dwelling of light,
JOB.38.19	And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;
JOB.38.20	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
JOB.38.20	And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?
JOB.38.21	And the number of thy days is great!
JOB.38.22	Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,
JOB.38.22	Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,
JOB.38.23	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	Against the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	By what way is the light parted,
JOB.38.24	Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood,
JOB.38.25	Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;
JOB.38.26	To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;
JOB.38.26	On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
JOB.38.27	To satisfy the waste and desolate 
JOB.38.27	And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
JOB.38.28	Hath the rain a father?
JOB.38.28	Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Out of whose womb came the ice?
JOB.38.29	And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
JOB.38.30	The waters are hidden as 
JOB.38.30	And the face of the deep is frozen.
JOB.38.31	Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades,
JOB.38.31	Or loose the bands of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season?
JOB.38.32	Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?
JOB.38.33	Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?
JOB.38.33	Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
JOB.38.34	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
JOB.38.34	That abundance of waters may cover thee?
JOB.38.35	Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go,
JOB.38.35	And say unto thee, Here we are?
JOB.38.36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
JOB.38.36	Or who hath given understanding to the mind?
JOB.38.37	Who can number the clouds by wisdom?
JOB.38.37	Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
JOB.38.38	When the dust runneth into a mass,
JOB.38.38	And the clods cleave fast together?
JOB.38.39	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness?
JOB.38.39	Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	When they couch in their dens,
JOB.38.41	Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God,
JOB.39.1	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
JOB.39.2	Canst thou number the months that they fulfill?
JOB.39.2	Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
JOB.39.3	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,
JOB.39.3	They cast out their sorrows.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up in the open field;
JOB.39.4	They go forth, and return not again,
JOB.39.5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
JOB.39.5	Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
JOB.39.6	Whose house I have made the wilderness,
JOB.39.6	And the salt land his dwelling place.
JOB.39.7	He scorneth the tumult of the city,
JOB.39.7	Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.
JOB.39.8	The range of the mountains is his pasture,
JOB.39.8	And he searcheth after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee?
JOB.39.9	Or will he abide by thy crib?
JOB.39.10	Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow?
JOB.39.10	Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
JOB.39.11	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
JOB.39.11	Or wilt thou leave to him thy labour?
JOB.39.12	Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed,
JOB.39.12	And gather 
JOB.39.13	The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth,
JOB.39.14	For she leaveth her eggs on the earth,
JOB.39.14	And warmeth them in the dust,
JOB.39.15	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	Or that the wild beast may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers:
JOB.39.16	Though her labour be in vain, 
JOB.39.17	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
JOB.39.17	Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
JOB.39.18	What time she lifteth up herself on high,
JOB.39.18	She scorneth the horse and his rider
JOB.39.19	Hast thou given the horse 
JOB.39.19	Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
JOB.39.20	Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?
JOB.39.20	The glory of his snorting is terrible.
JOB.39.21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
JOB.39.21	He goeth out to meet the armed men.
JOB.39.22	He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed;
JOB.39.22	Neither turneth he back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattleth against him,
JOB.39.23	The flashing spear and the javelin.
JOB.39.24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage;
JOB.39.24	Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.
JOB.39.25	As oft as the trumpet 
JOB.39.25	And he smelleth the battle afar off,
JOB.39.25	The thunder of the captains, and the shouting
JOB.39.26	Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom,
JOB.39.27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
JOB.39.27	And make her nest on high?
JOB.39.28	She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging 
JOB.39.28	Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong hold.
JOB.39.29	From thence she spieth out the prey;
JOB.39.29	Her eyes behold it afar off.
JOB.39.30	Her young ones also suck up blood:
JOB.39.30	And where the slain are, there is she.
JOB.40.1	Moreover the 
JOB.40.2	Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty?
JOB.40.2	He that argueth with God, let him answer it.
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee?
JOB.40.4	I lay mine hand upon my mouth.
JOB.40.5	Once have I spoken, and I will not answer;
JOB.40.5	Yea twice, but I will proceed no further
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	Gird up thy loins now like a man:
JOB.40.7	I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
JOB.40.8	Wilt thou even disannul my judgement?
JOB.40.8	Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?
JOB.40.9	Or hast thou an arm like God?
JOB.40.9	And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
JOB.40.10	Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity;
JOB.40.10	And array thyself with honour and majesty.
JOB.40.11	Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger:
JOB.40.11	And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.
JOB.40.12	Look on every one that is proud, 
JOB.40.12	And tread down the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together;
JOB.40.13	Bind their faces in the hidden 
JOB.40.14	Then wilt I also confess of thee
JOB.40.14	That thine own right hand can save thee
JOB.40.15	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;
JOB.40.15	He eateth grass as all ox.
JOB.40.16	Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
JOB.40.16	And his force is in the muscles of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He moveth his tail like a cedar:
JOB.40.17	The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are as tubes of brass;
JOB.40.18	His limbs are like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	He is the chief of the ways of God:
JOB.40.19	He 
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food;
JOB.40.20	Where all the beasts of the field do play.
JOB.40.21	He lieth under the lotus trees,
JOB.40.21	In the covert of the reed, and the fen.
JOB.40.22	The lotus trees cover him with their shadow;
JOB.40.22	The willows of the brook compass him about.
JOB.40.23	Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not:
JOB.40.23	He is confident, though Jordan swell even to his mouth.
JOB.40.24	Shall any take him when he is on the watch,
JOB.40.24	Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
JOB.41.1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish hook?
JOB.41.1	Or press down his tongue with a cord?
JOB.41.2	Canst thou put a rope into his nose?
JOB.41.2	Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications unto thee?
JOB.41.3	Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with thee,
JOB.41.4	That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?
JOB.41.5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
JOB.41.5	Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
JOB.41.6	Shall the bands 
JOB.41.6	Shall they part him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons,
JOB.41.7	Or his head with fish spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay thine hand upon him;
JOB.41.8	Remember the battle, and do so no more.
JOB.41.9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
JOB.41.9	Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
JOB.41.10	None is so fierce that he dare stir him up:
JOB.41.10	Who then is he that can stand before me?
JOB.41.11	Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?
JOB.41.12	I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
JOB.41.12	Nor his mighty strength, nor his comely proportion.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off his outer garment?
JOB.41.13	Who shall come within his double bridle?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face?
JOB.41.14	Round about his teeth is terror.
JOB.41.15	Shut up together 
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another,
JOB.41.16	That no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another;
JOB.41.17	They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
JOB.41.18	His neesings flash forth light,
JOB.41.18	And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning torches,
JOB.41.19	And sparks of fire leap forth.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth,
JOB.41.20	As of a seething pot and 
JOB.41.21	His breath kindleth coals,
JOB.41.21	And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck abideth strength,
JOB.41.22	And terror danceth before him.
JOB.41.23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together:
JOB.41.23	They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as firm as a stone;
JOB.41.24	Yea, firm as the nether millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid:
JOB.41.25	By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.
JOB.41.26	If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail;
JOB.41.26	Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
JOB.41.27	He counteth iron as straw,
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee:
JOB.41.28	Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
JOB.41.29	Clubs are counted as stubble:
JOB.41.29	He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
JOB.41.30	His underparts are 
JOB.41.30	He spreadeth 
JOB.41.31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
JOB.41.31	He maketh the sea like ointment.
JOB.41.32	He maketh a path to shine after him;
JOB.41.32	One would think the deep to be hoary.
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like,
JOB.41.33	That is made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He beholdeth every thing that is high:
JOB.41.34	He is king over all the sons of pride.
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	I know that thou canst do all things,
JOB.42.2	And that no purpose of thine can be restrained.
JOB.42.3	Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?
JOB.42.3	Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not,
JOB.42.3	Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
JOB.42.4	Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
JOB.42.5	I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear;
JOB.42.5	But now mine eye seeth thee,
JOB.42.6	Wherefore I abhor 
JOB.42.6	In dust and ashes.
JOB.42.7	And it was so, that after the 
JOB.42.8	Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the 
JOB.42.10	And the 
JOB.42.11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: And they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. 
JOB.42.15	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: And their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
JOB.42.16	And after this Job lived an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, 
JOB.42.17	So Job died, being old and full of days.
PSA.1.1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,
PSA.1.1	Nor standeth in the way of sinners,
PSA.1.1	Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
PSA.1.2	But his delight is in the law of the 
PSA.1.2	And in his law doth he meditate day and night
PSA.1.3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
PSA.1.3	That bringeth forth its fruit in its season,
PSA.1.3	Whose leaf also doth not wither;
PSA.1.3	And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
PSA.1.4	The wicked are not so;
PSA.1.4	But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgement,
PSA.1.5	Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.1.6	But the way of the wicked shall perish.
PSA.2.1	Why do the nations rage,
PSA.2.1	And the peoples imagine a vain thing?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth set themselves,
PSA.2.2	And the rulers take counsel together,
PSA.2.2	Against the 
PSA.2.3	Let us break their bands asunder,
PSA.2.3	And cast away their cords from us.
PSA.2.4	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
PSA.2.4	The Lord shall have them in derision.
PSA.2.5	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,
PSA.2.5	And vex them in his sore displeasure:
PSA.2.6	Yet I have set my king
PSA.2.6	Upon my holy hill of Zion.
PSA.2.7	I will tell of the decree:
PSA.2.7	The 
PSA.2.7	This day have I begotten thee.
PSA.2.8	Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
PSA.2.8	And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
PSA.2.9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
PSA.2.9	Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
PSA.2.10	Now therefore be wise, O ye kings:
PSA.2.10	Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	And rejoice with trembling.
PSA.2.12	Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way,
PSA.2.12	For his wrath will soon be kindled.
PSA.2.12	Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
PSA.3.1	Many are they that rise up against me.
PSA.3.2	Many there be which say of my soul,
PSA.3.2	There is no help for him in God. 
PSA.3.3	But thou, O 
PSA.3.3	My glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
PSA.3.4	I cry unto the 
PSA.3.4	And he answereth me out of his holy hill. 
PSA.3.5	I laid me down and slept;
PSA.3.5	I awaked; for the 
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people,
PSA.3.6	That have set themselves against me round about.
PSA.3.7	Arise, O 
PSA.3.7	For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone;
PSA.3.7	Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
PSA.3.8	Salvation belongeth unto the 
PSA.3.8	Thy blessing be upon thy people. 
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness;
PSA.4.1	Thou hast set me at large 
PSA.4.1	Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonour?
PSA.4.2	And seek after falsehood? 
PSA.4.3	But know that the 
PSA.4.3	The 
PSA.4.4	Stand in awe, and sin not:
PSA.4.4	Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. 
PSA.4.5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
PSA.4.5	And put your trust in the 
PSA.4.6	Many there be that say, Who will shew us 
PSA.4.7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
PSA.4.7	More than 
PSA.4.8	In peace will I both lay me down and sleep:
PSA.4.8	For thou, 
PSA.5.1	Give ear to my words, O 
PSA.5.1	Consider my meditation.
PSA.5.2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God:
PSA.5.2	For unto thee do I pray.
PSA.5.3	O 
PSA.5.3	In the morning will I order 
PSA.5.4	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
PSA.5.4	Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
PSA.5.5	The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight:
PSA.5.5	Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
PSA.5.6	Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies:
PSA.5.6	The 
PSA.5.7	But as for me, in the multitude of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house:
PSA.5.7	In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
PSA.5.8	Lead me, O 
PSA.5.8	Make thy way plain before my face.
PSA.5.9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
PSA.5.9	Their inward part is very wickedness:
PSA.5.9	Their throat is an open sepulchre;
PSA.5.9	They flatter with their tongue.
PSA.5.10	Hold them guilty, O God;
PSA.5.10	Let them fall by their own counsels:
PSA.5.10	Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions;
PSA.5.10	For they have rebelled against thee.
PSA.5.11	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice,
PSA.5.11	Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:
PSA.5.11	Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
PSA.5.12	For thou wilt bless the righteous;
PSA.5.12	O 
PSA.6.1	O 
PSA.6.1	Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
PSA.6.2	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.6.2	O 
PSA.6.3	My soul also is sore vexed:
PSA.6.3	And thou, O 
PSA.6.4	Return, O 
PSA.6.4	Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake.
PSA.6.5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee:
PSA.6.5	In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning;
PSA.6.6	Every night make I my bed to swim;
PSA.6.6	I water my couch with my tears.
PSA.6.7	Mine eye wasteth away because of grief;
PSA.6.7	It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.
PSA.6.8	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
PSA.6.8	For the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.10	All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed:
PSA.6.10	They shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
PSA.7.1	O 
PSA.7.1	Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me:
PSA.7.2	Lest he tear my soul like a lion,
PSA.7.2	Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
PSA.7.3	O 
PSA.7.3	If there be iniquity in my hands;
PSA.7.4	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
PSA.7.4	(yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary:)
PSA.7.5	Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;
PSA.7.5	Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth,
PSA.7.5	And lay my glory in the dust. 
PSA.7.6	Arise, O 
PSA.7.6	Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries:
PSA.7.6	And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgement.
PSA.7.7	And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about:
PSA.7.7	And over them return thou on high.
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.8	Judge me, O 
PSA.7.9	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous:
PSA.7.9	For the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
PSA.7.10	My shield is with God,
PSA.7.10	Which saveth the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge,
PSA.7.11	Yea, a God that hath indignation every day.
PSA.7.12	If a man turn not, he will whet his sword;
PSA.7.12	He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
PSA.7.13	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
PSA.7.13	He maketh his arrows fiery 
PSA.7.14	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity;
PSA.7.14	Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
PSA.7.15	He hath made a pit, and digged it,
PSA.7.15	And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
PSA.7.16	His mischief shall return upon his own head,
PSA.7.16	And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
PSA.7.17	I will give thanks unto the 
PSA.7.17	And will sing praise to the name of the 
PSA.8.1	O 
PSA.8.1	How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
PSA.8.1	Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens.
PSA.8.2	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength,
PSA.8.2	Because of thine adversaries,
PSA.8.2	That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
PSA.8.3	The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
PSA.8.4	What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
PSA.8.4	And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
PSA.8.5	For thou hast made him but little lower than God,
PSA.8.5	And crownest him with glory and honour.
PSA.8.6	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
PSA.8.6	Thou hast put all things under his feet:
PSA.8.7	All sheep and oxen,
PSA.8.7	Yea, and the beasts of the field;
PSA.8.8	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
PSA.8.8	Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.8.9	How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
PSA.9.1	I will give thanks unto the 
PSA.9.1	I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and exult in thee:
PSA.9.2	I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.
PSA.9.3	When mine enemies turn back,
PSA.9.3	They stumble and perish at thy presence.
PSA.9.4	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
PSA.9.4	Thou satest in the throne judging righteously.
PSA.9.5	Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
PSA.9.5	Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
PSA.9.6	The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever;
PSA.9.6	And the cities which thou hast overthrown,
PSA.9.6	Their very memorial is perished.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.7	He hath prepared his throne for judgement.
PSA.9.8	And he shall judge the world in righteousness,
PSA.9.8	He shall minister judgement to the peoples in uprightness.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	A high tower in times of trouble;
PSA.9.10	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee;
PSA.9.10	For thou, 
PSA.9.11	Sing praises to the 
PSA.9.11	Declare among the people his doings.
PSA.9.12	For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them:
PSA.9.12	He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.9.13	Behold my affliction 
PSA.9.13	Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;
PSA.9.14	That I may shew forth all thy praise:
PSA.9.14	In the gates of the daughter of Zion,
PSA.9.14	I will rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.9.15	The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made:
PSA.9.15	In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall return to Sheol,
PSA.9.17	Even all the nations that forget God.
PSA.9.18	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten,
PSA.9.18	Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.
PSA.9.19	Arise, O 
PSA.9.19	Let the nations be judged in thy sight.
PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, O 
PSA.9.20	Let the nations know themselves to be but men. 
PSA.10.1	Why standest thou afar off, O 
PSA.10.1	Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
PSA.10.2	In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued;
PSA.10.2	Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
PSA.10.3	And the covetous renounceth, 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, 
PSA.10.4	All his thoughts are, There is no God.
PSA.10.5	His ways are firm at all times;
PSA.10.5	Thy judgements are far above out of his sight:
PSA.10.5	As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
PSA.10.6	He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved:
PSA.10.6	To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression:
PSA.10.7	Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
PSA.10.8	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages:
PSA.10.8	In the covert places doth he murder the innocent:
PSA.10.8	His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
PSA.10.9	He lurketh in the covert as a lion in his den:
PSA.10.9	He lieth in wait to catch the poor:
PSA.10.9	He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
PSA.10.10	He croucheth, he boweth down,
PSA.10.10	And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
PSA.10.11	He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten:
PSA.10.11	He hideth his face; he will never see it.
PSA.10.12	Arise, O 
PSA.10.12	Forget not the poor.
PSA.10.13	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God,
PSA.10.13	And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require 
PSA.10.14	Thon hast seen 
PSA.10.14	The helpless committeth 
PSA.10.14	Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break thou the arm of the wicked;
PSA.10.15	And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	The nations are perished out of his land.
PSA.10.17	Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
PSA.10.18	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
PSA.10.18	That man which is of the earth may be terrible no more.
PSA.11.1	In the 
PSA.11.1	How say ye to my soul,
PSA.11.1	Flee as a bird to your mountain?
PSA.11.2	For, lo, the wicked bend the bow,
PSA.11.2	They make ready their arrow upon the string,
PSA.11.2	That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	If the foundations be destroyed,
PSA.11.3	What can the righteous do?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
PSA.11.6	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares;
PSA.11.6	Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
PSA.11.7	For the 
PSA.11.7	The upright shall behold his face.
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.1	For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
PSA.12.2	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour:
PSA.12.2	With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
PSA.12.3	The 
PSA.12.3	The tongue that speaketh great things:
PSA.12.4	Who have said, with our tongue will we prevail;
PSA.12.4	Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
PSA.12.5	For the spoiling of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
PSA.12.5	Now will I arise, saith the 
PSA.12.5	I will set him in safety at whom they puff.
PSA.12.6	The words of the 
PSA.12.6	As silver tried in a furnace on the earth,
PSA.12.6	Purified seven times.
PSA.12.7	Thou shalt keep them, O 
PSA.12.7	Thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
PSA.12.8	The wicked walk on every side,
PSA.12.8	When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
PSA.13.1	How long, O 
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
PSA.13.2	Having sorrow in my heart all the day?
PSA.13.2	How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
PSA.13.3	Consider 
PSA.13.3	Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the 
PSA.13.4	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him;
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in thy mercy;
PSA.13.5	My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation:
PSA.13.6	I will sing unto the 
PSA.13.6	Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
PSA.14.1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt, they have done abominable works;
PSA.14.1	there is none that doeth good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	To see if there were any that did understand,
PSA.14.2	That did seek after God.
PSA.14.3	They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy;
PSA.14.3	There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
PSA.14.4	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
PSA.14.4	Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
PSA.14.4	And call not upon the 
PSA.14.5	There were they in great fear:
PSA.14.5	For God is in the generation of the righteous.
PSA.14.6	Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor,
PSA.14.6	Because the 
PSA.14.7	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	Then shall Jacob rejoice, 
PSA.15.1	Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
PSA.15.2	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,
PSA.15.2	And speaketh truth in his heart.
PSA.15.3	He that slandereth not with his tongue,
PSA.15.3	Nor doeth evil to his friend,
PSA.15.3	Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
PSA.15.4	In whose eyes a reprobate is despised;
PSA.15.4	But he honoureth them that fear the 
PSA.15.4	He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
PSA.15.5	He that putteth not out his money to usury,
PSA.15.5	Nor taketh reward against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
PSA.16.2	I have said unto the 
PSA.16.2	I have no good beyond thee.
PSA.16.3	As for the saints that are in the earth,
PSA.16.3	They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
PSA.16.4	Their sorrows shall be multiplied that exchange 
PSA.16.4	Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer,
PSA.16.4	Nor take their names upon my lips.
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.5	Thou maintainest my lot.
PSA.16.6	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
PSA.16.6	Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.7	Yea, my reins instruct me in the night seasons.
PSA.16.8	I have set the 
PSA.16.8	Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
PSA.16.9	My flesh also shall dwell in safety.
PSA.16.10	For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol;
PSA.16.10	Neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
PSA.16.11	Thou wilt shew me the path of life:
PSA.16.11	In thy presence is fulness of joy;
PSA.16.11	In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
PSA.17.1	Hear the right, O 
PSA.17.1	Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
PSA.17.2	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
PSA.17.2	Let thine eyes look upon equity.
PSA.17.3	Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
PSA.17.3	Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing;
PSA.17.3	I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
PSA.17.4	As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips
PSA.17.4	I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
PSA.17.5	My steps have held fast to thy paths,
PSA.17.5	My feet have not slipped.
PSA.17.6	I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God:
PSA.17.6	Incline thine ear unto me, 
PSA.17.7	Shew thy marvelous lovingkindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust 
PSA.17.7	From those that rise up 
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of the eye,
PSA.17.8	Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
PSA.17.9	From the wicked that spoil me,
PSA.17.9	My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
PSA.17.10	They are enclosed in their own fat:
PSA.17.10	With their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They have now compassed us in our steps:
PSA.17.11	They set their eyes to cast 
PSA.17.12	He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,
PSA.17.12	And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.13	Confront him, cast him down:
PSA.17.13	Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;
PSA.17.14	From men, by thy hand, O 
PSA.17.14	From men of the world, whose portion is in 
PSA.17.14	And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure:
PSA.17.14	They are satisfied with children,
PSA.17.14	And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
PSA.17.15	As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness:
PSA.17.15	I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
PSA.18.1	I love thee, O 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	My God, my strong rock, in him will I trust;
PSA.18.2	My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
PSA.18.3	I will call upon the 
PSA.18.3	So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
PSA.18.4	The cords of death compassed me,
PSA.18.4	And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
PSA.18.5	The cords of Sheol were round about me:
PSA.18.5	The snares of death came on me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the 
PSA.18.6	And cried unto my God:
PSA.18.6	He heard my voice out of his temple,
PSA.18.6	And my cry before him came into his ears.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and trembled,
PSA.18.7	The foundations also of the mountains moved
PSA.18.7	And were shaken, because he was wroth.
PSA.18.8	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
PSA.18.8	And fire out of his mouth devoured:
PSA.18.8	Coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
PSA.18.9	And thick darkness was under his feet.
PSA.18.10	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
PSA.18.10	Yea, he flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion round about him;
PSA.18.11	Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
PSA.18.12	At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
PSA.18.12	Hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	And the Most High uttered his voice;
PSA.18.13	Hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.14	And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
PSA.18.14	Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of waters appeared,
PSA.18.15	And the foundations of the world were laid bare,
PSA.18.15	At thy rebuke, O 
PSA.18.15	At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
PSA.18.16	He sent from on high, he took me;
PSA.18.16	He drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	And from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
PSA.18.18	They came upon me in the day of my calamity:
PSA.18.18	But the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth also into a large place;
PSA.18.19	He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	And have not wickedly departed from my God.
PSA.18.22	For all his judgements were before me,
PSA.18.22	And I put not away his statutes from me.
PSA.18.23	I was also perfect with him,
PSA.18.23	And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
PSA.18.24	Therefore hath the 
PSA.18.24	According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
PSA.18.25	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful;
PSA.18.25	With the perfect man thou wilt shew thyself perfect;
PSA.18.26	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
PSA.18.26	And with the perverse thou wilt shew thyself froward.
PSA.18.27	For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
PSA.18.27	But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.
PSA.18.28	For thou wilt light my lamp:
PSA.18.28	The 
PSA.18.29	For by thee I run upon a troop;
PSA.18.29	And by my God do I leap over a wall.
PSA.18.30	As for God, his way is perfect:
PSA.18.30	The word of the 
PSA.18.30	He is a shield unto all them that trust in him.
PSA.18.31	For who is God, save the 
PSA.18.31	And who is a rock, beside our God?
PSA.18.32	The God that girdeth me with strength,
PSA.18.32	And maketh my way perfect.
PSA.18.33	He maketh my feet like hinds' 
PSA.18.33	And setteth me upon my high places.
PSA.18.34	He teacheth my hands to war;
PSA.18.34	So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
PSA.18.35	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
PSA.18.35	And thy right hand hath holden me up,
PSA.18.35	And thy gentleness hath made me great.
PSA.18.36	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
PSA.18.36	And my feet have not slipped.
PSA.18.37	I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them:
PSA.18.37	Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.
PSA.18.38	I will smite them through that they shall not be able to rise:
PSA.18.38	They shall fall under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:
PSA.18.39	Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
PSA.18.40	Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,
PSA.18.40	That I might cut off them that hate me.
PSA.18.41	They cried, but there was none to save:
PSA.18.41	Even unto the 
PSA.18.42	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
PSA.18.42	I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
PSA.18.43	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;
PSA.18.43	Thou hast made me the head of the nations:
PSA.18.43	A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me:
PSA.18.44	The strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
PSA.18.45	The strangers shall fade away,
PSA.18.45	And shall come trembling out of their close places.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	And exalted be the God of my salvation:
PSA.18.47	Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,
PSA.18.47	And subdueth peoples under me.
PSA.18.48	He rescueth me from mine enemies:
PSA.18.48	Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me:
PSA.18.48	Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
PSA.18.49	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O 
PSA.18.49	And will sing praises unto thy name.
PSA.18.50	Great deliverance giveth he to his king;
PSA.18.50	And sheweth lovingkindness to his anointed,
PSA.18.50	To David and to his seed, for evermore.
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God;
PSA.19.1	And the firmament sheweth his handywork.
PSA.19.2	Day unto day uttereth speech,
PSA.19.2	And night unto night sheweth knowledge.
PSA.19.3	There is no speech nor language;
PSA.19.3	Their voice cannot be heard.
PSA.19.4	Their line is gone out through all the earth,
PSA.19.4	And their words to the end of the world.
PSA.19.4	In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
PSA.19.5	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
PSA.19.5	And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.
PSA.19.6	His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
PSA.19.6	And his circuit unto the ends of it:
PSA.19.6	And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
PSA.19.7	The law of the 
PSA.19.7	The testimony of the 
PSA.19.8	The precepts of the 
PSA.19.8	The commandment of the 
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.9	The judgements of the 
PSA.19.10	More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
PSA.19.10	Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
PSA.19.11	In keeping of them there is great reward.
PSA.19.12	Who can discern 
PSA.19.12	Clear thou me from hidden 
PSA.19.13	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous 
PSA.19.13	Let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be perfect,
PSA.19.13	And I shall be clear from great transgression.
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight,
PSA.19.14	O 
PSA.20.1	The 
PSA.20.1	The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;
PSA.20.2	Send thee help from the sanctuary,
PSA.20.2	And strengthen thee out of Zion;
PSA.20.3	Remember all thy offerings,
PSA.20.3	And accept thy burnt sacrifice; 
PSA.20.4	Grant thee thy heart's desire,
PSA.20.4	And fulfill all thy counsel.
PSA.20.5	We will triumph in thy salvation,
PSA.20.5	And in the name of our God we will set up our banners:
PSA.20.5	The 
PSA.20.6	Now know I that the 
PSA.20.6	He wilt answer him from his holy heaven
PSA.20.6	With the saving strength of his right hand.
PSA.20.7	Some 
PSA.20.7	But we will make mention of the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They are bowed down and fallen:
PSA.20.8	But we are risen, and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Save, 
PSA.20.9	Let the King answer us when we call.
PSA.21.1	The king shall joy in thy strength, O 
PSA.21.1	And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
PSA.21.2	Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
PSA.21.2	And hast not withholden the request of his lips. 
PSA.21.3	For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness:
PSA.21.3	Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him;
PSA.21.4	Even length of days for ever and ever.
PSA.21.5	His glory is great in thy salvation:
PSA.21.5	Honour and majesty dost thou lay upon him.
PSA.21.6	For thou makest him most blessed for ever:
PSA.21.6	Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusteth in the 
PSA.21.7	And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
PSA.21.8	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies:
PSA.21.8	Thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
PSA.21.9	Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger.
PSA.21.9	The 
PSA.21.9	And the fire shall devour them.
PSA.21.10	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth,
PSA.21.10	And their seed from among the children of men.
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against thee:
PSA.21.11	They imagined a device, which they are not able to perform.
PSA.21.12	For thou shalt make them turn their back,
PSA.21.12	Thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them.
PSA.21.13	Be thou exalted, O 
PSA.21.13	So will we sing and praise thy power.
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
PSA.22.2	O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou answerest not;
PSA.22.2	And in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA.22.3	But thou art holy,
PSA.22.3	O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in thee:
PSA.22.4	They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
PSA.22.5	They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
PSA.22.5	They trusted in thee, and were not ashamed.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm, and no man;
PSA.22.6	A reproach of men, and despised of the people.
PSA.22.7	All they that see me laugh me to scorn:
PSA.22.7	They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, 
PSA.22.8	Commit 
PSA.22.8	Let him deliver him, seeing he delighteth in him.
PSA.22.9	But thou art he that took me out the womb:
PSA.22.9	Thou didst make me trust 
PSA.22.10	I was cast upon thee from the womb:
PSA.22.10	Thou art my God from my mother's belly.
PSA.22.11	Be not far from me; for trouble is near;
PSA.22.11	For there is none to help.
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have compassed me:
PSA.22.12	Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
PSA.22.13	They gape upon me with their mouth,
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water,
PSA.22.14	And all my bones are out of joint:
PSA.22.14	My heart is like wax;
PSA.22.14	It is melted in the midst of my bowels.
PSA.22.15	My Strength is dried up like a potsherd;
PSA.22.15	And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws;
PSA.22.15	And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have compassed me:
PSA.22.16	The assembly of evil-doers have enclosed me;
PSA.22.16	They pierced my hands and my feet.
PSA.22.17	I may tell all my bones;
PSA.22.17	They look and stare upon me:
PSA.22.18	They part my garments among them,
PSA.22.18	And upon my vesture do they cast lots.
PSA.22.19	But be not thou far off, O 
PSA.22.19	O thou my succour, haste thee to help me.
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword;
PSA.22.20	My darling from the power of the dog.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the lion's mouth;
PSA.22.21	Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.
PSA.22.22	I will declare thy name unto my brethren:
PSA.22.22	In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
PSA.22.23	Ye that fear the 
PSA.22.23	All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him;
PSA.22.23	And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.
PSA.22.24	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted;
PSA.22.24	Neither hath he hid his face from him;
PSA.22.24	But when he cried unto him, he heard.
PSA.22.25	Of thee cometh my praise in the great congregation:
PSA.22.25	I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
PSA.22.26	The meek shall eat and be satisfied:
PSA.22.26	They shall praise the 
PSA.22.26	Let your heart live for ever.
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the 
PSA.22.27	And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
PSA.22.28	For the kingdom is the 
PSA.22.28	And he is the ruler over the nations
PSA.22.29	All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship:
PSA.22.29	All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him,
PSA.22.29	Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.
PSA.22.30	A seed shall serve him;
PSA.22.30	It shall be told of the Lord unto the 
PSA.22.31	They shall come and shall declare his righteousness
PSA.22.31	Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.2	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
PSA.23.2	He leadeth me beside the still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restoreth my soul:
PSA.23.3	He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
PSA.23.4	I will fear no evil; for thou art with me:
PSA.23.4	Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
PSA.23.5	Thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
PSA.23.6	And I will dwell in the house of the 
PSA.24.1	The earth is the 
PSA.24.1	The world, and they that dwell therein.
PSA.24.2	For he hath founded it upon the seas,
PSA.24.2	And established it upon the floods.
PSA.24.3	Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
PSA.24.3	And who shall stand in his holy place?
PSA.24.4	He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;
PSA.24.4	Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
PSA.24.4	And hath not sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He shall receive a blessing from the 
PSA.24.5	And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
PSA.24.6	This is the generation of them that seek after him,
PSA.24.6	That seek thy face, 
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
PSA.24.7	And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors:
PSA.24.7	And the King of glory shall come in.
PSA.24.8	Who is the King of glory?
PSA.24.8	The 
PSA.24.8	The 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
PSA.24.9	yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors:
PSA.24.9	And the King of glory shall come in.
PSA.24.10	Who is this King of glory?
PSA.24.10	The 
PSA.24.10	He is the King of glory. 
PSA.25.1	Unto thee, O 
PSA.25.2	O my God, in thee have I trusted,
PSA.25.2	Let me not be ashamed;
PSA.25.2	Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
PSA.25.3	Yea, none that wait on thee shall be ashamed:
PSA.25.3	They shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause.
PSA.25.4	Shew me thy ways, O 
PSA.25.4	Teach me thy paths.
PSA.25.5	Guide me in thy truth, and teach me;
PSA.25.5	For thou art the God of my salvation;
PSA.25.5	On thee do I wait all the day.
PSA.25.6	Remember, O 
PSA.25.6	For they have been ever of old.
PSA.25.7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
PSA.25.7	According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me,
PSA.25.7	For thy goodness' sake, O 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright is the 
PSA.25.8	Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.
PSA.25.9	The meek will he guide in judgement:
PSA.25.9	And the meek will he teach his way.
PSA.25.10	All the paths of the 
PSA.25.10	Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
PSA.25.11	For thy name's sake, O 
PSA.25.11	Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
PSA.25.12	What man is he that feareth the 
PSA.25.12	Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.
PSA.25.13	His soul shall dwell at ease;
PSA.25.13	And his seed shall inherit the land.
PSA.25.14	The secret of the 
PSA.25.14	And he will shew them his covenant.
PSA.25.15	Mine eyes are ever toward the 
PSA.25.15	For he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
PSA.25.16	Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me;
PSA.25.16	For I am desolate and afflicted.
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart are enlarged:
PSA.25.17	O bring thou me out of my distresses.
PSA.25.18	Consider mine affliction and my travail;
PSA.25.18	And forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider mine enemies, for they are many;
PSA.25.19	And they hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA.25.20	O keep my soul, and deliver me:
PSA.25.20	Let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in thee.
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,
PSA.25.21	For I wait on thee.
PSA.25.22	Redeem Israel, O God,
PSA.25.22	Out of all his troubles.
PSA.26.1	Judge me, O 
PSA.26.1	I have trusted also in the 
PSA.26.2	Examine me, O 
PSA.26.2	Try my reins and my heart.
PSA.26.3	For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes;
PSA.26.3	And I have walked in thy truth.
PSA.26.4	I have not sat with vain persons;
PSA.26.4	Neither will I go in with dissemblers.
PSA.26.5	I hate the congregation of evil-doers,
PSA.26.5	And will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I will wash mine hands in innocency;
PSA.26.6	So will I compass thine altar, O 
PSA.26.7	That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,
PSA.26.7	And tell of all thy wondrous works.
PSA.26.8	And the place where thy glory dwelleth.
PSA.26.9	Gather not my soul with sinners,
PSA.26.9	Nor my life with men of blood:
PSA.26.10	In whose hands is mischief,
PSA.26.10	And their right hand is full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
PSA.26.11	Redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
PSA.26.12	My foot standeth in an even place:
PSA.26.12	In the congregations will I bless the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.2	When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh,
PSA.27.3	Though an host should encamp against me,
PSA.27.3	My heart shall not fear:
PSA.27.3	Though war should rise against me,
PSA.27.3	Even then will I be confident.
PSA.27.4	One thing have I asked of the 
PSA.27.4	That I may dwell in the house of the 
PSA.27.4	To behold the beauty of the 
PSA.27.5	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me secretly in his pavilion:
PSA.27.5	In the covert of his tabernacle shall he hide me;
PSA.27.5	He shall lift me up upon a rock.
PSA.27.6	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me;
PSA.27.6	And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
PSA.27.6	I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the 
PSA.27.7	Hear, O 
PSA.27.7	Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
PSA.27.8	Thy face, 
PSA.27.9	Hide not thy face from me;
PSA.27.9	Put not thy servant away in anger:
PSA.27.9	Thou hast been my help;
PSA.27.9	Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
PSA.27.10	For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
PSA.27.10	But the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.27.11	And lead me in a plain path,
PSA.27.11	Because of mine enemies.
PSA.27.12	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries:
PSA.27.12	For false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
PSA.27.13	In the land of the living.
PSA.27.14	Wait on the 
PSA.27.14	Be strong, and let thine heart take courage;
PSA.27.14	Yea, wait thou on the 
PSA.28.1	Unto thee, O 
PSA.28.1	My rock, be not thou deaf unto me:
PSA.28.1	Lest, if thou be silent unto me,
PSA.28.1	I become like them that go down into the pit.
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,
PSA.28.2	When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
PSA.28.3	Draw me not away with the wicked,
PSA.28.3	And with the workers of iniquity;
PSA.28.3	Which speak peace with their neighbours,
PSA.28.3	But mischief is in their hearts
PSA.28.4	Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:
PSA.28.4	Give them after the operation of their hands;
PSA.28.4	Render to them their desert.
PSA.28.5	Because they regard not the works of the 
PSA.28.5	Nor the operation of his hands,
PSA.28.5	He shall break them down and not build them up.
PSA.28.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.28.6	Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
PSA.28.7	The 
PSA.28.7	My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped:
PSA.28.7	Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
PSA.28.7	And with my song will praise him.
PSA.28.8	The 
PSA.28.8	And he is a strong hold of salvation to his anointed.
PSA.28.9	Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:
PSA.28.9	Feed them also, and bear them up for ever.
PSA.29.1	Give unto the 
PSA.29.1	Give unto the 
PSA.29.2	Give unto the 
PSA.29.2	Worship the 
PSA.29.3	The voice of the 
PSA.29.3	The God of glory thundereth,
PSA.29.3	Even the 
PSA.29.4	The voice of the 
PSA.29.4	The voice of the 
PSA.29.5	The voice of the 
PSA.29.5	Yea, the 
PSA.29.6	He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
PSA.29.6	Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
PSA.29.7	The voice of the 
PSA.29.8	The voice of the 
PSA.29.8	The 
PSA.29.9	The voice of the 
PSA.29.9	And strippeth the forests bare:
PSA.29.9	And in his temple every thing saith, Glory.
PSA.29.10	The 
PSA.29.10	Yea, the 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.29.11	the 
PSA.30.1	I will extol thee, O 
PSA.30.1	And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
PSA.30.2	O 
PSA.30.2	I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
PSA.30.3	O 
PSA.30.3	Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
PSA.30.4	Sing praise unto the 
PSA.30.4	And give thanks to his holy name.
PSA.30.5	For his anger is but for a moment;
PSA.30.5	In his favour is life:
PSA.30.5	Weeping may tarry for the night,
PSA.30.5	But joy 
PSA.30.6	As for me, I said in my prosperity,
PSA.30.6	I shall never be moved.
PSA.30.7	Thou, 
PSA.30.7	Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.
PSA.30.8	I cried to thee, O 
PSA.30.8	And unto the 
PSA.30.9	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
PSA.30.9	Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
PSA.30.10	Hear, O 
PSA.30.11	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing;
PSA.30.11	Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:
PSA.30.12	To the end that 
PSA.30.12	O 
PSA.31.1	In thee, O 
PSA.31.1	Deliver me in thy righteousness.
PSA.31.2	Bow down thine ear unto me; deliver me speedily:
PSA.31.2	Be thou to me a strong rock, an house of defence to save me.
PSA.31.3	For thou art my rock and my fortress;
PSA.31.3	Therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me.
PSA.31.4	Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;
PSA.31.4	For thou art my strong hold.
PSA.31.5	Into thine hand I commend my spirit:
PSA.31.5	Thou hast redeemed me, O 
PSA.31.6	I hate them that regard lying vanities:
PSA.31.6	But I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy:
PSA.31.7	For thou hast seen my affliction;
PSA.31.7	Thou hast known my soul in adversities:
PSA.31.8	And thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy;
PSA.31.8	Thou hast set my feet in a large place.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.31.9	Mine eye wasteth away with grief, 
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing:
PSA.31.10	My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.
PSA.31.11	Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,
PSA.31.11	Yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a fear to mine acquaintance:
PSA.31.11	They that did see me without fled from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
PSA.31.12	I am like a broken vessel.
PSA.31.13	For I have heard the defaming of many,
PSA.31.13	Terror on every side:
PSA.31.13	While they took counsel together against me,
PSA.31.13	They devised to take away my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trusted in thee, O 
PSA.31.14	I said, Thou art my God.
PSA.31.15	My times are in thy hand:
PSA.31.15	Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
PSA.31.16	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
PSA.31.16	Save me in thy lovingkindness.
PSA.31.17	Let me not he ashamed, O 
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be ashamed, let them be silent in Sheol.
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be dumb;
PSA.31.18	Which speak against the righteous insolently,
PSA.31.18	With pride and contempt.
PSA.31.19	Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee,
PSA.31.19	Which thou hast wrought for them that put their trust in thee, before the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	In the covert of thy presence shalt thou hide them from the plottings of man:
PSA.31.20	Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.31.21	For he hath shewed me his marvelous lovingkindness in a strong city.
PSA.31.22	As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
PSA.31.22	Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
PSA.31.23	O love the 
PSA.31.23	The 
PSA.31.23	And plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
PSA.31.24	Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
PSA.31.24	All ye that hope in the 
PSA.32.1	Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
PSA.32.2	Blessed is the man unto whom the 
PSA.32.2	And in whose spirit there is no guile.
PSA.32.3	When I kept silence, my bones waxed old
PSA.32.3	Through my roaring all the day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:
PSA.32.4	My moisture was changed 
PSA.32.5	I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid:
PSA.32.5	I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the 
PSA.32.5	And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. 
PSA.32.6	For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found:
PSA.32.6	Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.
PSA.32.7	Thou art my hiding place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble;
PSA.32.7	Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. 
PSA.32.8	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
PSA.32.8	I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.
PSA.32.9	Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding:
PSA.32.9	Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in,
PSA.32.10	Many sorrows shall be to the wicked:
PSA.32.10	But he that trusteth in the 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the 
PSA.32.11	And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
PSA.33.1	Rejoice in the 
PSA.33.1	Praise is comely for the upright.
PSA.33.2	Give thanks unto the 
PSA.33.2	Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.
PSA.33.3	Sing unto him a new song;
PSA.33.3	Play skilfully with a loud noise.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.4	And all his work is 
PSA.33.5	He loveth righteousness and judgement:
PSA.33.5	The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the 
PSA.33.6	By the word of the 
PSA.33.6	And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
PSA.33.7	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap:
PSA.33.7	He layeth up the deeps in storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the 
PSA.33.8	Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
PSA.33.9	For he spake, and it was done;
PSA.33.9	He commanded, and it stood fast.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of none effect.
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the 
PSA.33.11	The thoughts of his heart to all generations.
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.12	The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.13	He beholdeth all the sons of men;
PSA.33.14	From the place of his habitation he looketh forth
PSA.33.14	Upon all the inhabitants of the earth;
PSA.33.15	He that fashioneth the hearts of them all,
PSA.33.15	That considereth all their works.
PSA.33.16	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:
PSA.33.16	A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
PSA.33.17	An horse is a vain thing for safety:
PSA.33.17	Neither shall he deliver any by his great power.
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eye of the 
PSA.33.18	Upon them that hope in his mercy;
PSA.33.19	To deliver their soul from death,
PSA.33.19	And to keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	Our soul hath waited for the 
PSA.33.20	He is our help and our shield.
PSA.33.21	For our heart shall rejoice in him,
PSA.33.21	Because we have trusted in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	Let thy mercy, O 
PSA.33.22	According as we have hoped in thee.
PSA.34.1	I will bless the 
PSA.34.1	His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
PSA.34.2	My soul shall make her boast in the 
PSA.34.2	The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.
PSA.34.3	O magnify the 
PSA.34.3	And let us exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.4	And delivered me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	They looked unto him, and were lightened:
PSA.34.5	And their faces shall never be confounded.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.6	And saved him out of all his troubles.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the 
PSA.34.7	And delivereth them.
PSA.34.8	O taste and see that the 
PSA.34.8	Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
PSA.34.9	O fear the 
PSA.34.9	For there is no want to them that fear him.
PSA.34.10	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger:
PSA.34.10	But they that seek the 
PSA.34.11	Come, ye children, hearken unto me:
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	What man is he that desireth life,
PSA.34.12	And loveth 
PSA.34.13	Keep thy tongue from evil,
PSA.34.13	And thy lips from speaking guile.
PSA.34.14	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.34.14	Seek peace, and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.15	And his ears are 
PSA.34.16	The face of the 
PSA.34.16	To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
PSA.34.17	And delivered them out of all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	And saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
PSA.34.19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous:
PSA.34.19	But the 
PSA.34.20	He keepeth all his bones:
PSA.34.20	Not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil shall slay the wicked:
PSA.34.21	And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	And none of them that trust in him shall be condemned.
PSA.35.1	Strive thou, O 
PSA.35.1	Fight thou against them that fight against me.
PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler,
PSA.35.2	And stand up for mine help.
PSA.35.3	Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me:
PSA.35.3	Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
PSA.35.4	Let them be ashamed and brought to dishonour that seek after my soul:
PSA.35.4	Let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt.
PSA.35.5	Let them be as chaff before the wind,
PSA.35.5	And the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	And the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	For without cause have they hid for me their net 
PSA.35.7	Without cause have they digged 
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come upon him at unawares;
PSA.35.8	And let his net that he hath hid catch himself:
PSA.35.8	With destruction let him fall therein.
PSA.35.9	And my soul shall be joyful in the 
PSA.35.9	It shall rejoice in his salvation.
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say, 
PSA.35.10	Which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
PSA.35.10	Yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
PSA.35.11	Unrighteous witnesses rise up;
PSA.35.11	They ask me of things that I know not.
PSA.35.12	They reward me evil for good,
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
PSA.35.13	I afflicted my soul with fasting;
PSA.35.13	And my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
PSA.35.14	I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother:
PSA.35.14	I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother.
PSA.35.15	But when I halted they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together:
PSA.35.15	The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew 
PSA.35.15	They did tear me, and ceased not:
PSA.35.16	Like the profane mockers in feasts,
PSA.35.16	They gnashed upon me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue my soul from their destructions,
PSA.35.17	My darling from the lions.
PSA.35.18	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation:
PSA.35.18	I will praise thee among much people.
PSA.35.19	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
PSA.35.19	Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
PSA.35.20	For they speak not peace:
PSA.35.20	But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.
PSA.35.21	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me;
PSA.35.21	They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
PSA.35.22	Thou hast seen it, O 
PSA.35.22	O Lord, be not far from me.
PSA.35.23	Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgement,
PSA.35.24	Judge me, O 
PSA.35.24	And let them not rejoice over me.
PSA.35.25	Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it:
PSA.35.25	Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
PSA.35.26	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that rejoice at mine hurt:
PSA.35.26	Let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause:
PSA.35.27	Yea, let them say continually, The 
PSA.35.27	Which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
PSA.35.28	And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness,
PSA.36.1	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,
PSA.36.1	There is no fear of God before his eyes.
PSA.36.2	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,
PSA.36.2	That his iniquity shall not be found out and be hated.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit:
PSA.36.3	He hath left off to be wise 
PSA.36.4	He deviseth iniquity upon his bed;
PSA.36.4	He setteth himself in a way that is not good;
PSA.36.4	He abhorreth not evil.
PSA.36.5	Thy lovingkindness, O 
PSA.36.5	Thy faithfulness 
PSA.36.6	Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God;
PSA.36.6	Thy judgements are a great deep:
PSA.36.6	O 
PSA.36.7	How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God!
PSA.36.7	And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
PSA.36.8	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
PSA.36.8	And thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
PSA.36.9	For with thee is the fountain of life:
PSA.36.9	In thy light shall we see light.
PSA.36.10	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee;
PSA.36.10	And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of pride come against me,
PSA.36.11	And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
PSA.36.12	They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
PSA.37.1	Fret not thyself because of evil-doers,
PSA.37.1	Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.
PSA.37.2	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
PSA.37.2	And wither as the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	Dwell in the land, and follow after faithfulness.
PSA.37.4	Delight thyself also in the 
PSA.37.4	And he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
PSA.37.5	Commit thy way unto the 
PSA.37.5	Trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass.
PSA.37.6	Add he shall make thy righteousness to go forth as the light,
PSA.37.6	And thy judgement as the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Rest in the 
PSA.37.7	Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
PSA.37.7	Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:
PSA.37.8	Fret not thyself, 
PSA.37.9	For evil-doers shall be cut off:
PSA.37.9	But those that wait upon the 
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be:
PSA.37.10	Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.
PSA.37.11	But the meek shall inherit the land;
PSA.37.11	And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plotteth against the just,
PSA.37.12	And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord shall laugh at him:
PSA.37.13	For he seeth that his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow;
PSA.37.14	To cast down the poor and needy,
PSA.37.14	To slay such as be upright in the way:
PSA.37.15	Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
PSA.37.15	And their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	Better is a little that the righteous hath
PSA.37.16	Than the abundance of many wicked.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken:
PSA.37.17	But the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	And their inheritance shall be for ever.
PSA.37.19	They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil:
PSA.37.19	And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked shall perish,
PSA.37.20	And the enemies of the 
PSA.37.20	They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again:
PSA.37.21	But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.
PSA.37.22	For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the land;
PSA.37.22	And they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
PSA.37.23	A man's goings are established of the 
PSA.37.23	And he delighteth in his way.
PSA.37.24	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down:
PSA.37.24	For the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and now am old;
PSA.37.25	Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
PSA.37.25	Nor his seed begging 
PSA.37.26	All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth;
PSA.37.26	And his seed is blessed.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.37.27	And dwell for evermore.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	And forsaketh not his saints;
PSA.37.28	they are preserved for ever:
PSA.37.28	But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall inherit the land,
PSA.37.29	And dwell therein for ever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom,
PSA.37.30	And his tongue speaketh judgement.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart;
PSA.37.31	None of his steps shall slide.
PSA.37.32	The wicked watcheth the righteous,
PSA.37.32	And seeketh to slay him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.33	Nor condemn him when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait on the 
PSA.37.34	And he shall exalt thee to inherit the land:
PSA.37.34	When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked in great power,
PSA.37.35	And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
PSA.37.36	But one passed by, and, lo, he was not:
PSA.37.36	Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright:
PSA.37.37	For the latter end of 
PSA.37.38	As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together:
PSA.37.38	The latter end of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous is of the 
PSA.37.39	He is their strong hold in the time of trouble.
PSA.37.40	And the 
PSA.37.40	He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them,
PSA.37.40	Because they have taken refuge in him.
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.1	Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
PSA.38.2	For thine arrows stick fast in me,
PSA.38.2	And thy hand presseth me sore.
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation;
PSA.38.3	Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
PSA.38.4	As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds stink and are corrupt,
PSA.38.5	Because of my foolishness.
PSA.38.6	I am pained and bowed down greatly;
PSA.38.6	I go mourning all the day long.
PSA.38.7	For my loins are filled with burning;
PSA.38.7	And there is no soundness in my flesh.
PSA.38.8	I am faint and sore bruised:
PSA.38.8	I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire is before thee;
PSA.38.9	And my groaning is not hid from thee.
PSA.38.10	My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me:
PSA.38.10	As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague;
PSA.38.11	And my kinsmen stand afar off.
PSA.38.12	They also that seek after my life lay snares 
PSA.38.12	And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
PSA.38.12	And imagine deceits all the day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, as a deaf man, hear not;
PSA.38.13	And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
PSA.38.14	Yea, I am as a man that heareth not,
PSA.38.14	And in whose mouth are no reproofs.
PSA.38.15	For in thee, O 
PSA.38.15	Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, Lest they rejoice over me:
PSA.38.16	When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to halt,
PSA.38.17	And my sorrow is continually before me.
PSA.38.18	For I will declare mine iniquity;
PSA.38.18	I will be sorry for my sin.
PSA.38.19	But mine enemies are lively, 
PSA.38.19	And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
PSA.38.20	They also that render evil for good
PSA.38.20	Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.
PSA.38.21	Forsake me not, O 
PSA.38.21	O my God, be not far from me.
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord my salvation.
PSA.39.1	I said, I will take heed to my ways,
PSA.39.1	That I sin not with my tongue:
PSA.39.1	I will keep my mouth with a bridle,
PSA.39.1	While the wicked is before me.
PSA.39.2	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good;
PSA.39.2	And my sorrow was stirred.
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me;
PSA.39.3	While I was musing the fire kindled:
PSA.39.4	And the measure of my days, what it is;
PSA.39.4	Let me know how frail I am.
PSA.39.5	Behold, thou hast made my days 
PSA.39.5	And mine age is as nothing before thee:
PSA.39.5	Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. 
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walketh in a vain shew:
PSA.39.6	Surely they are disquieted in vain:
PSA.39.6	He heapeth up 
PSA.39.7	And now, Lord, what wait I for?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in thee.
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions:
PSA.39.8	Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
PSA.39.9	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
PSA.39.9	Because thou didst it.
PSA.39.10	Remove thy stroke away from me:
PSA.39.10	I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
PSA.39.11	When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity,
PSA.39.11	Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:
PSA.39.11	Surely every man is vanity. 
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.12	And give ear unto my cry;
PSA.39.12	Hold not thy peace at my tears:
PSA.39.12	For I am a stranger with thee,
PSA.39.12	A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
PSA.39.13	O spare me, that I may recover strength,
PSA.39.13	Before I go hence, and be no more.
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay;
PSA.40.2	And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
PSA.40.3	And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
PSA.40.3	Many shall see it, and fear,
PSA.40.3	And shall trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Blessed is the man that maketh the 
PSA.40.4	And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
PSA.40.5	Many, O 
PSA.40.5	And thy thoughts which are to us-ward:
PSA.40.5	They cannot be set in order unto thee;
PSA.40.5	If I would declare and speak of them,
PSA.40.5	They are more than can be numbered.
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in;
PSA.40.6	Mine ears hast thou opened:
PSA.40.6	Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
PSA.40.7	Then said I, Lo, I am come;
PSA.40.7	In the roll of the book it is written of me:
PSA.40.8	I delight to do thy will, O my God;
PSA.40.8	Yea, thy law is within my heart.
PSA.40.9	I have published righteousness in the great congregation;
PSA.40.9	Lo, I will not refrain my lips,
PSA.40.9	O 
PSA.40.10	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart;
PSA.40.10	I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation:
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
PSA.40.11	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O 
PSA.40.11	Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have compassed me about,
PSA.40.12	Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;
PSA.40.12	They are more than the hairs of mine head, and my heart hath failed me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O 
PSA.40.13	Make haste to help me, O 
PSA.40.14	Let them be ashamed and confounded together
PSA.40.14	That seek after my soul to destroy it:
PSA.40.14	Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour
PSA.40.14	That delight in my hurt.
PSA.40.15	Let them be desolate by reason of their shame
PSA.40.15	That say unto me, Aha, Aha.
PSA.40.16	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:
PSA.40.16	Let such as love thy salvation say continually,
PSA.40.16	The 
PSA.40.17	But I am poor and needy;
PSA.40.17	Thou art my help and my deliverer;
PSA.40.17	Make no tarrying, O my God.
PSA.41.1	Blessed is he that considereth the poor:
PSA.41.1	The 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	Thou makest all his bed in his sickness.
PSA.41.4	I said, O 
PSA.41.4	Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
PSA.41.5	Mine enemies speak evil against me, 
PSA.41.5	When shall he die, and his name perish?
PSA.41.6	And if he come to see 
PSA.41.6	His heart gathereth iniquity to itself:
PSA.41.6	When he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
PSA.41.7	All that hate me whisper together against me:
PSA.41.7	Against me do they devise my hurt.
PSA.41.8	An evil disease, 
PSA.41.8	And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
PSA.41.9	Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread,
PSA.41.9	Hath lifted up his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But thou, O 
PSA.41.10	That I may requite them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that thou delightest in me,
PSA.41.11	Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity,
PSA.41.12	And settest me before thy face for ever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the 
PSA.41.13	From everlasting and to everlasting.
PSA.41.13	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.42.1	As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
PSA.42.1	So panteth my soul after thee, O God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
PSA.42.2	When shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my meat day and night,
PSA.42.3	While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.4	These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,
PSA.42.4	How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God,
PSA.42.4	With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.
PSA.42.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
PSA.42.5	And 
PSA.42.5	Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him
PSA.42.6	O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
PSA.42.6	Therefore do I remember thee from the land of Jordan,
PSA.42.6	And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts:
PSA.42.7	All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
PSA.42.8	And in the night his song shall be with me,
PSA.42.9	I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.42.10	As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me;
PSA.42.10	While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.11	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
PSA.42.11	And why art thou disquieted within me?
PSA.42.11	Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
PSA.43.1	O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
PSA.43.2	For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou cast me off?
PSA.43.2	Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	O send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me:
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me unto thy holy hill,
PSA.43.3	And to thy tabernacles.
PSA.43.4	Then will I go unto the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	Unto God my exceeding joy:
PSA.43.4	And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
PSA.43.5	And why art thou disquieted within me?
PSA.43.5	Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
PSA.44.1	What work thou didst in their days, in the days of old.
PSA.44.2	Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand, and plantedst them in;
PSA.44.2	Thou didst afflict the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.
PSA.44.3	For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword,
PSA.44.3	Neither did their own arm save them:
PSA.44.3	But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
PSA.44.3	Because thou hadst a favour unto them.
PSA.44.4	Thou art my King, O God:
PSA.44.4	Command deliverance for Jacob.
PSA.44.5	Through thee will we push down our adversaries:
PSA.44.5	Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	Neither shall my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But thou hast saved us from our adversaries,
PSA.44.7	And hast put them to shame that hate us.
PSA.44.8	In God have we made our boast all the day long,
PSA.44.8	And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. 
PSA.44.9	But now thou hast cast 
PSA.44.9	And goest not forth with our hosts.
PSA.44.10	Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary:
PSA.44.10	And they which hate us spoil for themselves.
PSA.44.11	Thou hast given us like sheep 
PSA.44.11	And hast scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	Thou sellest thy people for nought,
PSA.44.12	And hast not increased 
PSA.44.13	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours,
PSA.44.13	A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
PSA.44.14	Thou makest us a byword among the nations,
PSA.44.14	A shaking of the head among the peoples.
PSA.44.15	All the day long is my dishonour before me,
PSA.44.15	And the shame of my face hath covered me,
PSA.44.16	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth;
PSA.44.16	By reason of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
PSA.44.17	Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart is not turned back,
PSA.44.18	Neither have our steps declined from thy way;
PSA.44.19	That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals,
PSA.44.19	And covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we have forgotten the name of our God,
PSA.44.20	Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
PSA.44.21	Shall not God search this out?
PSA.44.21	For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long;
PSA.44.22	We are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Arise, cast 
PSA.44.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
PSA.44.24	And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
PSA.44.25	Our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
PSA.44.26	Rise up for our help,
PSA.44.26	And redeem us for thy lovingkindness' sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter:
PSA.45.1	I speak the things which I have made touching the king:
PSA.45.1	My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
PSA.45.2	Thou art fairer than the children of men;
PSA.45.2	Grace is poured into thy lips:
PSA.45.2	Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
PSA.45.3	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one,
PSA.45.3	Thy glory and thy majesty.
PSA.45.4	And in thy majesty ride on prosperously,
PSA.45.4	Because of truth and meekness 
PSA.45.4	And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
PSA.45.5	Thine arrows are sharp;
PSA.45.5	The peoples fall under thee;
PSA.45.6	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
PSA.45.6	A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
PSA.45.7	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness:
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
PSA.45.7	With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
PSA.45.8	All thy garments 
PSA.45.8	Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings' daughters are among thy honourable women:
PSA.45.9	At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
PSA.45.10	Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
PSA.45.11	So shall the king desire thy beauty:
PSA.45.11	For he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
PSA.45.12	And the daughter of Tyre 
PSA.45.12	Even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour.
PSA.45.13	The king's daughter within 
PSA.45.13	Her clothing is inwrought with gold.
PSA.45.14	She shall be led unto the king in broidered work:
PSA.45.14	The virgins her companions that follow her
PSA.45.14	Shall be brought unto thee.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led:
PSA.45.15	They shall enter into the king's palace.
PSA.45.16	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,
PSA.45.16	Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
PSA.45.17	Therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	A very present help in trouble.
PSA.46.2	Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change,
PSA.46.2	And though the mountains be moved in the heart of the seas;
PSA.46.3	Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
PSA.46.3	Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. 
PSA.46.4	There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God,
PSA.46.4	The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
PSA.46.5	God shall help her, and that right early.
PSA.46.6	The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved:
PSA.46.6	He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob is our refuge. 
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the 
PSA.46.8	What desolations he hath made in the earth.
PSA.46.9	He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;
PSA.46.9	He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;
PSA.46.9	He burneth the chariots in the fire.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I am God:
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob is our refuge. 
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all ye peoples;
PSA.47.1	Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.2	He is a great King over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He shall subdue the peoples under us,
PSA.47.3	And the nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He shall choose our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	The excellency of Jacob whom he loved. 
PSA.47.5	God is gone up with a shout,
PSA.47.5	The 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises:
PSA.47.6	Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth:
PSA.47.7	Sing ye praises with understanding.
PSA.47.8	God reigneth over the nations:
PSA.47.8	God sitteth upon his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the peoples are gathered together
PSA.47.9	For the shields of the earth belong unto God;
PSA.47.9	He is greatly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great is the 
PSA.48.1	In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
PSA.48.2	Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
PSA.48.2	Is mount Zion, 
PSA.48.2	The city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,
PSA.48.4	They passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw it, then were they amazed;
PSA.48.5	They were dismayed, they hasted away.
PSA.48.6	Trembling took hold of them there;
PSA.48.6	Pain, as of a woman in travail.
PSA.48.7	With the east wind
PSA.48.7	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen
PSA.48.8	In the city of the 
PSA.48.8	God will establish it for ever. 
PSA.48.9	We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O God,
PSA.48.9	In the midst of thy temple.
PSA.48.10	As is thy name, O God,
PSA.48.10	So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth:
PSA.48.10	Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Let mount Zion be glad,
PSA.48.11	Let the daughters of Judah rejoice,
PSA.48.11	Because of thy judgements.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, and go round about her:
PSA.48.12	Tell the towers thereof.
PSA.48.13	Mark ye welt her bulwarks,
PSA.48.13	Consider her palaces;
PSA.48.13	That ye may tell it to the generation following.
PSA.48.14	For this God is our God for ever and ever:
PSA.48.14	He will be our guide 
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all ye peoples;
PSA.49.1	Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
PSA.49.2	Both low and high,
PSA.49.2	Rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak wisdom;
PSA.49.3	And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will incline mine ear to a parable:
PSA.49.4	I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
PSA.49.5	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
PSA.49.5	When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?
PSA.49.6	They that trust in their wealth,
PSA.49.6	And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
PSA.49.7	None 
PSA.49.7	Nor give to God a ransom for him:
PSA.49.8	(For the redemption of their soul is costly,
PSA.49.8	And must be let alone for ever:)
PSA.49.9	That he should still live alway,
PSA.49.9	That he should not see corruption.
PSA.49.10	For he seeth that wise men die,
PSA.49.10	The fool and the brutish together perish,
PSA.49.10	And leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought is, 
PSA.49.11	They call their lands after their own names.
PSA.49.12	But man abideth not in honour:
PSA.49.12	He is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.49.13	This their way is their folly:
PSA.49.13	Yet after them men approve their sayings. 
PSA.49.14	They are appointed as a flock for Sheol;
PSA.49.14	Death shall be their shepherd:
PSA.49.14	And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
PSA.49.14	And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for it.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol:
PSA.49.15	For he shall receive me. 
PSA.49.16	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich,
PSA.49.16	When the glory of his house is increased:
PSA.49.17	For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away;
PSA.49.17	His glory shall not descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lived he blessed his soul,
PSA.49.18	And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,
PSA.49.19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
PSA.49.19	They shall never see the light.
PSA.49.20	Man that is in honour, and understandeth not,
PSA.49.20	Is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.50.1	God, 
PSA.50.1	And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God hath shined forth.
PSA.50.3	Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence:
PSA.50.3	A fire shall devour before him,
PSA.50.3	And it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
PSA.50.4	He shall call to the heavens above,
PSA.50.4	And to the earth, that he may judge his people:
PSA.50.5	Gather my saints together unto me;
PSA.50.5	Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
PSA.50.6	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness;
PSA.50.6	For God is judge himself. 
PSA.50.7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	O Israel, and I will testify unto thee:
PSA.50.7	I am God, 
PSA.50.8	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices;
PSA.50.8	And thy burnt offerings are continually before me.
PSA.50.9	I will take no bullock out of thy house,
PSA.50.9	Nor he-goats out of thy folds.
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is mine,
PSA.50.10	And the cattle upon a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know all the fowls of the mountains:
PSA.50.11	And the wild beasts of the field are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee:
PSA.50.12	For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
PSA.50.13	Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
PSA.50.13	Or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving;
PSA.50.14	And pay thy vows unto the Most High:
PSA.50.15	And call upon me in the day of trouble;
PSA.50.15	I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
PSA.50.16	But unto the wicked God saith,
PSA.50.16	What hast thou to do to declare my statutes;
PSA.50.16	And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth?
PSA.50.17	Seeing thou hatest instruction,
PSA.50.17	And castest my words behind thee.
PSA.50.18	When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him,
PSA.50.18	And hast been partaker with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	Thou givest thy mouth to evil,
PSA.50.19	And thy tongue frameth deceit.
PSA.50.20	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother;
PSA.50.20	Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
PSA.50.21	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence;
PSA.50.21	Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself:
PSA.50.22	Now consider this, ye that forget God,
PSA.50.22	Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:
PSA.50.23	Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me;
PSA.50.23	And to him that ordereth his conversation 
PSA.50.23	Will I shew the salvation of God.
PSA.51.1	Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness;
PSA.51.1	According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me throughly from mine iniquity,
PSA.51.2	And cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I acknowledge my transgressions:
PSA.51.3	And my sin is ever before me.
PSA.51.4	Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
PSA.51.4	And done that which is evil in thy sight:
PSA.51.4	That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest,
PSA.51.4	And be clear when thou judgest.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;
PSA.51.5	And in sin did my mother conceive me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts:
PSA.51.6	And in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me to hear joy and gladness;
PSA.51.8	That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide thy face from my sins,
PSA.51.9	And blot out all mine iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God;
PSA.51.10	And renew a right spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Cast me not away from thy presence;
PSA.51.11	And take not thy holy spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation:
PSA.51.12	And uphold me with a free spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then will I teach transgressors thy ways;
PSA.51.13	And sinners shall be converted unto thee.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation;
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open thou my lips;
PSA.51.15	And my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
PSA.51.16	For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it:
PSA.51.16	Thou hast no pleasure in burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:
PSA.51.17	A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
PSA.51.18	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
PSA.51.18	Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then shalt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
PSA.51.19	Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
PSA.52.1	Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man?
PSA.52.1	the mercy of God 
PSA.52.2	Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness;
PSA.52.2	Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	Thou lovest evil more than good;
PSA.52.3	And lying rather than to speak righteousness. 
PSA.52.4	Thou lovest all devouring words,
PSA.52.4	O thou deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	God shall likewise destroy thee for ever,
PSA.52.5	He shall take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent,
PSA.52.5	And root thee out of the land of the living. 
PSA.52.6	The righteous also shall see 
PSA.52.6	And shall laugh at him, 
PSA.52.7	Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength;
PSA.52.7	But trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.7	And strengthened himself in his wickedness.
PSA.52.8	But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God:
PSA.52.8	I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it:
PSA.52.9	And I will wait on thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.
PSA.53.1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
PSA.53.1	Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity;
PSA.53.1	There is none that doeth good.
PSA.53.2	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
PSA.53.2	To see if there were any that did understand,
PSA.53.2	That did seek after God.
PSA.53.3	Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy;
PSA.53.3	There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
PSA.53.4	Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
PSA.53.4	And call not upon God.
PSA.53.5	There were they in great fear, where no fear was:
PSA.53.5	For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee;
PSA.53.5	Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them.
PSA.53.6	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God bringeth back the captivity of his people,
PSA.53.6	Then shall Jacob rejoice, 
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by thy name,
PSA.54.1	And judge me in thy might.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers are risen up against me,
PSA.54.3	And violent men have sought after my soul:
PSA.54.3	They have not set God before them. 
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is mine helper:
PSA.54.4	The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.
PSA.54.5	He shall requite the evil unto mine enemies:
PSA.54.5	Destroy thou them in thy truth.
PSA.54.6	With a freewill offering will I sacrifice unto thee:
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks unto thy name, O 
PSA.54.7	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble;
PSA.54.7	And mine eye hath seen 
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God;
PSA.55.1	And hide not thyself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Attend unto me, and answer me:
PSA.55.2	I am restless in my complaint, and moan;
PSA.55.3	Because of the voice of the enemy,
PSA.55.3	Because of the oppression of the wicked;
PSA.55.3	For they cast iniquity upon me,
PSA.55.3	And in anger they persecute me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is sore pained within me:
PSA.55.4	And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
PSA.55.5	And horror hath overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.6	Then would I fly away, and be at rest.
PSA.55.7	Lo, then would I wander far off,
PSA.55.7	I would lodge in the wilderness. 
PSA.55.8	I would haste me to a shelter
PSA.55.8	From the stormy wind and tempest.
PSA.55.9	Destroy, O Lord, 
PSA.55.9	For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go about upon the walls thereof:
PSA.55.10	Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
PSA.55.11	Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
PSA.55.11	Oppression and guile depart not from her streets.
PSA.55.12	For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
PSA.55.12	Then I could have borne it:
PSA.55.12	Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
PSA.55.12	Then I would have hid myself from him:
PSA.55.13	But it was thou, a man mine equal,
PSA.55.13	My companion, and my familiar friend.
PSA.55.14	We took sweet counsel together,
PSA.55.14	We walked in the house of God with the throng.
PSA.55.15	Let death come suddenly upon them,
PSA.55.15	Let them go down alive into the pit:
PSA.55.15	For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call upon God;
PSA.55.16	And the 
PSA.55.17	Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan:
PSA.55.17	And he shall hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
PSA.55.18	For they were many 
PSA.55.19	God shall hear, and answer them,
PSA.55.19	Even he that abideth of old, 
PSA.55.19	And who fear not God.
PSA.55.20	He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him:
PSA.55.20	He hath profaned his covenant.
PSA.55.21	His mouth was smooth as butter,
PSA.55.21	But his heart was war:
PSA.55.21	His words were softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	Yet were they drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast thy burden upon the 
PSA.55.22	And he shall sustain thee:
PSA.55.22	He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
PSA.55.23	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
PSA.55.23	Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
PSA.55.23	But I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up:
PSA.56.1	All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.
PSA.56.2	Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long:
PSA.56.2	For they be many that fight proudly against me.
PSA.56.3	What time I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will put my trust in thee.
PSA.56.4	In God I will praise his word:
PSA.56.4	In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid;
PSA.56.4	What can flesh do unto me?
PSA.56.5	All the day long they wrest my words:
PSA.56.5	All their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,
PSA.56.6	They mark my steps,
PSA.56.6	Even as they have waited for my soul.
PSA.56.7	Shall they escape by iniquity?
PSA.56.7	In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
PSA.56.8	Thou tellest my wanderings:
PSA.56.8	Put thou my tears into thy bottle;
PSA.56.8	Are they not in thy book?
PSA.56.9	Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call:
PSA.56.9	This I know, that God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God will I praise 
PSA.56.10	In the 
PSA.56.11	In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid;
PSA.56.11	What can man do unto me?
PSA.56.12	Thy vows are upon me, O God:
PSA.56.12	I will render thank offerings unto thee.
PSA.56.13	For thou hast delivered my soul from death:
PSA.56.13	That I may walk before God
PSA.56.13	In the light of the living.
PSA.57.1	Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me;
PSA.57.1	For my soul taketh refuge in thee:
PSA.57.1	Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge,
PSA.57.1	Until 
PSA.57.2	I will cry unto God Most High;
PSA.57.2	Unto God that performeth 
PSA.57.3	He shall send from heaven, and save me,
PSA.57.3	God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
PSA.57.4	My soul is among lions;
PSA.57.4	I lie among them that are set on fire,
PSA.57.4	Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	And their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
PSA.57.6	They have prepared a net for my steps;
PSA.57.6	Thy soul is bowed down:
PSA.57.6	They have digged a pit before me;
PSA.57.6	They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. 
PSA.57.7	My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed:
PSA.57.7	I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
PSA.57.8	Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp:
PSA.57.8	I myself will awake right early.
PSA.57.9	I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples:
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens,
PSA.57.10	And thy truth unto the skies.
PSA.57.11	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
PSA.58.1	Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness?
PSA.58.1	Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
PSA.58.2	Yea, in heart ye work wickedness;
PSA.58.2	Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb:
PSA.58.3	They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent:
PSA.58.5	Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers,
PSA.58.5	Charming never so wisely.
PSA.58.6	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth:
PSA.58.6	Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O 
PSA.58.7	Let them melt away as water that runneth apace:
PSA.58.7	When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the thorns,
PSA.58.9	He shall take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
PSA.58.10	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance:
PSA.58.10	He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous:
PSA.58.11	Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
PSA.59.1	Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
PSA.59.2	And save me from the bloodthirsty men.
PSA.59.3	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;
PSA.59.3	The mighty gather themselves together against me:
PSA.59.3	Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O 
PSA.59.4	They run and prepare themselves without 
PSA.59.4	Awake thou to help me, and behold.
PSA.59.5	Even thou, O 
PSA.59.5	Arise to visit all the heathen:
PSA.59.5	Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening, they make a noise like a dog,
PSA.59.6	And go round about the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
PSA.59.7	Swords are in their lips:
PSA.59.7	For who, 
PSA.59.8	But thou, O 
PSA.59.8	Thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
PSA.59.9	O my strength, I will wait upon thee:
PSA.59.9	For God is my high tower.
PSA.59.10	The God of my mercy shall prevent me:
PSA.59.10	God shall let me see 
PSA.59.11	Slay them not, lest my people forget:
PSA.59.11	Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down,
PSA.59.11	O Lord our shield.
PSA.59.12	Let them even be taken in their pride,
PSA.59.12	And for cursing and lying which they speak.
PSA.59.13	Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more:
PSA.59.13	And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob,
PSA.59.13	Unto the ends of the earth. 
PSA.59.14	And at evening let them return, let them make a noise like a dog,
PSA.59.14	And go round about the city.
PSA.59.15	They shall wander up and down for meat
PSA.59.15	And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of thy strength;
PSA.59.16	Yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning:
PSA.59.16	For thou hast been my high tower,
PSA.59.16	And a refuge in the day of my distress.
PSA.59.17	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises:
PSA.59.17	For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
PSA.60.1	O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down;
PSA.60.1	Thou hast been angry; O restore us again.
PSA.60.2	Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it:
PSA.60.2	Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
PSA.60.3	Thou hast shewed thy people hard things:
PSA.60.3	Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.
PSA.60.4	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee,
PSA.60.4	That it may be displayed because of the truth. 
PSA.60.5	That thy beloved may be delivered,
PSA.60.5	Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
PSA.60.6	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will exult:
PSA.60.6	I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim also is the defence of mine head;
PSA.60.7	Judah is my sceptre
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washpot;
PSA.60.8	Upon Edom will I cast my shoe:
PSA.60.8	Philistia, shout thou because of me.
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the strong city?
PSA.60.9	Who hath led me unto Edom?
PSA.60.10	Hast not thou, O God, cast us off?
PSA.60.10	And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
PSA.60.11	Give us help against the adversary:
PSA.60.11	For vain is the help of man.
PSA.60.12	Through God we shall do valiantly:
PSA.60.12	For he it is that shall tread down our adversaries.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	Attend unto my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed:
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For thou hast been a refuge for me,
PSA.61.3	A strong tower from the enemy.
PSA.61.4	I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever:
PSA.61.4	I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. 
PSA.61.5	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows:
PSA.61.5	Thou hast given 
PSA.61.6	Thou wilt prolong the king's life:
PSA.61.6	His years shall be as many generations.
PSA.61.7	He shall abide before God for ever:
PSA.61.7	O prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
PSA.61.8	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever,
PSA.61.8	That I may daily perform my vows.
PSA.62.1	My soul waiteth only upon God:
PSA.62.1	From him 
PSA.62.2	He only is my rock and my salvation:
PSA.62.3	How long will ye set upon a man,
PSA.62.3	That ye may slay 
PSA.62.3	Like a bowing wall, like a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They only consult to thrust him down from his excellency;
PSA.62.4	They delight in lies:
PSA.62.4	They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. 
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait thou only upon God;
PSA.62.5	For my expectation is from him.
PSA.62.6	He only is my rock and my salvation:
PSA.62.6	I shall not be moved.
PSA.62.7	With God is my salvation and my glory:
PSA.62.7	The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times, ye people;
PSA.62.8	Pour out your heart before him:
PSA.62.8	God is a refuge for us. 
PSA.62.9	Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie:
PSA.62.9	In the balances they will go up;
PSA.62.9	They are together lighter than vanity.
PSA.62.10	Trust not in oppression,
PSA.62.10	And become not vain in robbery:
PSA.62.10	If riches increase, set not your heart 
PSA.62.11	God hath spoken once,
PSA.62.11	Twice have I heard this;
PSA.62.11	That power belongeth unto God:
PSA.62.12	Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy:
PSA.62.12	For thou renderest to every man according to his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee:
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee,
PSA.63.1	In a dry and weary land, where no water is.
PSA.63.2	So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary,
PSA.63.2	To see thy power and thy glory.
PSA.63.3	For thy lovingkindness is better than life;
PSA.63.3	My lips shall praise thee.
PSA.63.4	So will I bless thee while I live:
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands in thy name.
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
PSA.63.5	And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;
PSA.63.6	When I remember thee upon my bed,
PSA.63.7	For thou hast been my help,
PSA.63.7	And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
PSA.63.8	My soul followeth hard after thee:
PSA.63.8	Thy right hand upholdeth me.
PSA.63.9	But those that seek my soul, to destroy it,
PSA.63.9	Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They shall be given over to the power of the sword:
PSA.63.10	They shall be a portion for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God:
PSA.63.11	Every one that sweareth by him shall glory;
PSA.63.11	For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint:
PSA.64.1	Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers;
PSA.64.2	From the tumult of the workers of iniquity:
PSA.64.3	Who have whet their tongue like a sword,
PSA.64.3	And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words:
PSA.64.4	That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect:
PSA.64.4	Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves in an evil purpose;
PSA.64.5	They commune of laying snares privily;
PSA.64.5	They say, Who shall see them?
PSA.64.6	They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, 
PSA.64.6	And the inward thought of every one, and the heart, is deep.
PSA.64.7	But God shall shoot at them;
PSA.64.7	With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them:
PSA.64.8	All that see them shall wag the head.
PSA.64.9	And all men shall fear;
PSA.64.9	And they shall declare the work of God,
PSA.64.9	And shall wisely consider of his doing.
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.64.10	And all the upright in heart shall glory.
PSA.65.1	Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion:
PSA.65.1	And unto thee shall the vow be performed.
PSA.65.2	O thou that hearest prayer,
PSA.65.2	Unto thee shall all flesh come.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities prevail against me:
PSA.65.3	As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
PSA.65.4	Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach 
PSA.65.4	That he may dwell in thy courts:
PSA.65.4	We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house,
PSA.65.4	The holy place of thy temple.
PSA.65.5	By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness,
PSA.65.5	O God of our salvation;
PSA.65.5	Thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
PSA.65.5	And of them that are afar off upon the sea:
PSA.65.6	Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains;
PSA.65.6	Being girded about with might:
PSA.65.7	Which stilleth the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves,
PSA.65.7	And the tumult of the peoples.
PSA.65.8	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens:
PSA.65.8	Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
PSA.65.9	Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it,
PSA.65.9	Thou greatly enrichest it;
PSA.65.9	The river of God is full of water:
PSA.65.9	Thou providest them corn, when thou hast so prepared the earth.
PSA.65.10	Thou waterest her furrows abundantly;
PSA.65.10	Thou settlest the ridges thereof:
PSA.65.10	Thou makest it soft with showers;
PSA.65.10	Thou blessest the springing thereof.
PSA.65.11	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness;
PSA.65.11	And thy paths drop fatness.
PSA.65.12	They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:
PSA.65.12	And the hills are girded with joy.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are clothed with flocks;
PSA.65.13	The valleys also are covered over with corn;
PSA.65.13	They shout for joy, they also sing.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:
PSA.66.2	Sing forth the glory of his name:
PSA.66.2	Make his praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say unto God, How terrible are thy works!
PSA.66.3	Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
PSA.66.4	All the earth shall worship thee,
PSA.66.4	And shall sing unto thee;
PSA.66.4	They shall sing to thy name. 
PSA.66.5	Come, and see the works of God;
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land:
PSA.66.6	They went through the river on foot:
PSA.66.6	There did we rejoice in him.
PSA.66.7	He ruleth by his might for ever;
PSA.66.7	His eyes observe the nations:
PSA.66.7	Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. 
PSA.66.8	O bless our God, ye peoples,
PSA.66.8	And make the voice of his praise to be heard:
PSA.66.9	Which holdeth our soul in life,
PSA.66.9	And suffereth not our feet to be moved.
PSA.66.10	For thou, O God, hast proved us:
PSA.66.10	Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
PSA.66.11	Thou broughtest us into the net;
PSA.66.11	Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
PSA.66.12	Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and through water;
PSA.66.12	But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
PSA.66.13	I will come into thy house with burnt offerings,
PSA.66.13	I will pay thee my vows,
PSA.66.14	Which my lips have uttered,
PSA.66.14	And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress.
PSA.66.15	I will offer unto thee burnt offerings of fatlings,
PSA.66.15	With the incense of rams;
PSA.66.15	I will offer bullocks with goats. 
PSA.66.16	Come, and hear, all ye that fear God,
PSA.66.16	And I will declare what he hath done for my soul
PSA.66.17	I cried unto him with my mouth,
PSA.66.17	And he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard iniquity in my heart,
PSA.66.18	The Lord will not hear:
PSA.66.19	But verily God hath heard;
PSA.66.19	He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God,
PSA.66.20	Which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
PSA.67.1	God be merciful unto us, and bless us,
PSA.67.2	That thy way may be known upon earth,
PSA.67.2	Thy saving health among all nations.
PSA.67.3	Let the peoples praise thee, O God;
PSA.67.3	Let all the peoples praise thee.
PSA.67.4	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy:
PSA.67.4	For thou shalt judge the peoples with equity,
PSA.67.4	And govern the nations upon earth. 
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise thee, O God;
PSA.67.5	Let all the peoples praise thee.
PSA.67.6	The earth hath yielded her increase:
PSA.67.6	God, even our own God, shall bless us.
PSA.67.7	God shall bless us;
PSA.67.7	And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered;
PSA.68.1	Let them also that hate him flee before him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away:
PSA.68.2	As wax melteth before the fire,
PSA.68.2	So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God:
PSA.68.3	Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.
PSA.68.4	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name:
PSA.68.4	Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts;
PSA.68.4	His name is 
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows,
PSA.68.5	Is God in his holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God setteth the solitary in families:
PSA.68.6	He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity:
PSA.68.6	But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people,
PSA.68.7	When thou didst march through the wilderness; 
PSA.68.8	The earth trembled,
PSA.68.8	The heavens also dropped at the presence of God:
PSA.68.9	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain,
PSA.68.9	Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
PSA.68.10	Thy congregation dwelt therein:
PSA.68.10	Thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord giveth the word:
PSA.68.11	The women that publish the tidings are a great host.
PSA.68.12	Kings of armies flee, they flee:
PSA.68.12	And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.
PSA.68.13	Will ye lie among the sheepfolds,
PSA.68.13	And her pinions with yellow gold?
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings therein,
PSA.68.15	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
PSA.68.15	An high mountain is the mountain of Bashan
PSA.68.16	Why look ye askance, ye high mountains,
PSA.68.16	At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode?
PSA.68.16	Yea, the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands:
PSA.68.17	The Lord is among them, 
PSA.68.18	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led 
PSA.68.18	Thou hast received gifts among men,
PSA.68.18	Yea, 
PSA.68.18	That the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our burden,
PSA.68.19	Even the God who is our salvation. 
PSA.68.20	God is unto us a God of deliverances;
PSA.68.20	And unto 
PSA.68.21	But God shall smite through the head of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	The hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his guiltiness.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan,
PSA.68.22	I will bring 
PSA.68.23	That thou mayest dip thy foot in blood,
PSA.68.23	That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from 
PSA.68.24	They have seen thy goings, O God,
PSA.68.24	Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,
PSA.68.25	In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.
PSA.68.26	Bless ye God in the congregations,
PSA.68.26	Even the Lord, 
PSA.68.27	There is little Benjamin their ruler,
PSA.68.27	The princes of Judah 
PSA.68.27	The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
PSA.68.28	Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
PSA.68.29	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	Kings shall bring presents unto thee.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,
PSA.68.30	The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples,
PSA.68.30	Trampling under foot the pieces of silver;
PSA.68.30	He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Princes shall come out of Egypt;
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God.
PSA.68.32	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth;
PSA.68.32	O sing praises unto the Lord; 
PSA.68.33	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old;
PSA.68.33	Lo, he uttereth his voice, 
PSA.68.34	Ascribe ye strength unto God:
PSA.68.34	His excellency is over Israel,
PSA.68.34	And his strength is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	O God, 
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto 
PSA.68.35	Blessed be God.
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God;
PSA.69.1	For the waters are come in unto my soul.
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing:
PSA.69.2	I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried:
PSA.69.3	Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
PSA.69.4	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head:
PSA.69.4	They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
PSA.69.4	Then I restored that which I took not away.
PSA.69.5	O God, thou knowest my foolishness;
PSA.69.5	And my sins are not hid from thee.
PSA.69.6	Let not them that wait on thee be ashamed through me, O Lord 
PSA.69.6	Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonour through me, O God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
PSA.69.7	Shame hath covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
PSA.69.8	And an alien unto my mother's children.
PSA.69.9	For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up;
PSA.69.9	And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept, 
PSA.69.10	That was to my reproach.
PSA.69.11	When I made sackcloth my clothing,
PSA.69.11	I became a proverb unto them.
PSA.69.12	They that sit in the gate talk of me;
PSA.69.12	And 
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O 
PSA.69.13	O God, in the multitude of thy mercy,
PSA.69.13	Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink:
PSA.69.14	Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
PSA.69.15	Neither let the deep swallow me up;
PSA.69.15	And let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, O 
PSA.69.16	According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.
PSA.69.17	And hide not thy face from thy servant;
PSA.69.17	For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
PSA.69.18	Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it:
PSA.69.18	Ransom me because of mine enemies.
PSA.69.19	Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
PSA.69.19	Mine adversaries are all before thee.
PSA.69.20	Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:
PSA.69.20	And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
PSA.69.20	And for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They gave me also gall for my meat;
PSA.69.21	And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their table before them become a snare;
PSA.69.22	And when they are in peace, 
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not;
PSA.69.23	And make their loins continually to shake.
PSA.69.24	Pour out thine indignation upon them,
PSA.69.24	And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	Let their habitation be desolate;
PSA.69.25	Let none dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten;
PSA.69.26	And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity unto their iniquity:
PSA.69.27	And let them not come into thy righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Let them be blotted out of the book of life,
PSA.69.28	And not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I am poor and sorrowful:
PSA.69.29	Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song,
PSA.69.30	And will magnify him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	And it shall please the 
PSA.69.32	The meek have seen it, and are glad:
PSA.69.32	Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	And despiseth not his prisoners.
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise him,
PSA.69.34	The seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;
PSA.69.35	And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
PSA.69.36	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it;
PSA.69.36	And they that love his name shall dwell therein.
PSA.70.1	Make haste to help me, O 
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and confounded
PSA.70.2	That seek after my soul:
PSA.70.2	Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour
PSA.70.2	That delight in my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back by reason of their shame
PSA.70.3	That say, Aha, Aha.
PSA.70.4	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee;
PSA.70.4	And let such as love thy salvation say continually,
PSA.70.4	Let God be magnified.
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and needy;
PSA.70.5	Make haste unto me, O God:
PSA.70.5	Thou art my help and my deliverer;
PSA.70.5	O 
PSA.71.1	In thee, O 
PSA.71.1	Let me never be ashamed.
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me:
PSA.71.2	Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
PSA.71.3	Thou hast given commandment to save me;
PSA.71.3	For thou art my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
PSA.71.5	For thou art my hope, O Lord 
PSA.71.6	By thee have I been holden up from the womb:
PSA.71.6	Thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels:
PSA.71.6	My praise shall be continually of thee.
PSA.71.7	I am as a wonder unto many;
PSA.71.7	But thou art my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth shall be filled with thy praise,
PSA.71.8	And with thy honour all the day.
PSA.71.9	Cast me not off in the time of old age;
PSA.71.9	Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
PSA.71.10	For mine enemies speak concerning me;
PSA.71.10	And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
PSA.71.11	Saying, God hath forsaken him:
PSA.71.11	Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.
PSA.71.12	O God, be not far from me:
PSA.71.12	O my God, make haste to help me.
PSA.71.13	Let them be ashamed 
PSA.71.13	Let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually,
PSA.71.14	And will praise thee yet more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness,
PSA.71.15	For I know not the numbers 
PSA.71.16	I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord 
PSA.71.16	I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
PSA.71.17	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth;
PSA.71.17	And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
PSA.71.18	Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not;
PSA.71.18	Until I have declared thy strength unto 
PSA.71.18	Thy might to every one that is to come.
PSA.71.19	Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high;
PSA.71.19	Thou who hast done great things,
PSA.71.19	O God, who is like unto thee?
PSA.71.20	Thou, which hast shewed us many and sore troubles,
PSA.71.20	Shalt quicken us again,
PSA.71.20	And shalt bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	Increase thou my greatness,
PSA.71.21	And turn again and comfort me.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise thee with the psaltery,
PSA.71.22	Unto thee will I sing praises with the harp,
PSA.71.22	O thou Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto thee;
PSA.71.23	And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
PSA.71.24	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
PSA.71.24	For they are ashamed, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king thy judgements, O God,
PSA.72.1	And thy righteousness unto the king's son.
PSA.72.2	He shall judge thy people with righteousness,
PSA.72.2	And thy poor with judgement.
PSA.72.3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people,
PSA.72.3	And the hills, in righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He shall judge the poor of the people,
PSA.72.4	He shall save the children of the needy,
PSA.72.4	And shall break in pieces the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear thee while the sun endureth,
PSA.72.5	And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass:
PSA.72.6	As showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days shall the righteous flourish;
PSA.72.7	And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.
PSA.72.8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
PSA.72.8	And from the River unto the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him;
PSA.72.9	And his enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
PSA.72.10	The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him:
PSA.72.11	All nations shall serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth;
PSA.72.12	And the poor, that hath no helper.
PSA.72.13	He shall have pity on the poor and needy,
PSA.72.13	And the souls of the needy he shall save.
PSA.72.14	He shall redeem their soul from oppression and violence;
PSA.72.14	And precious shall their blood be in his sight:
PSA.72.15	And they shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
PSA.72.15	And men shall pray for him continually;
PSA.72.15	They shall bless him all the day long.
PSA.72.16	There shall be abundance of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains;
PSA.72.16	The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon:
PSA.72.16	And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
PSA.72.17	His name shall endure for ever;
PSA.72.17	His name shall be continued as long as the sun:
PSA.72.17	And men shall be blessed in him;
PSA.72.17	All nations shall call him happy.
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the 
PSA.72.18	Who only doeth wondrous things:
PSA.72.19	And blessed be his glorious name for ever;
PSA.72.19	And let the whole earth be filled with his glory.
PSA.72.19	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Surely God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
PSA.73.2	my steps had well nigh slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious at the arrogant,
PSA.73.3	When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	For there are no bands in their death:
PSA.73.4	But their strength is firm.
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble as 
PSA.73.5	Neither are they plagued like 
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;
PSA.73.6	Violence covereth them as a garment.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes stand out with fatness:
PSA.73.7	They have more than heart could wish.
PSA.73.8	They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression:
PSA.73.8	They speak loftily.
PSA.73.9	They have set their mouth in the heavens,
PSA.73.9	And their tongue walketh through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return hither:
PSA.73.10	And waters of a full 
PSA.73.11	And they say, How doth God know?
PSA.73.11	And is there knowledge in the Most High?
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the wicked;
PSA.73.12	And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches
PSA.73.13	Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,
PSA.73.13	And washed my hands in innocency;
PSA.73.14	For all the day long have I been plagued,
PSA.73.14	And chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, I will speak thus;
PSA.73.15	Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
PSA.73.16	When I thought how I might know this,
PSA.73.16	It was too painful for me;
PSA.73.17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God,
PSA.73.17	And considered their latter end.
PSA.73.18	Surely thou settest them in slippery places:
PSA.73.18	Thou castest them down to destruction.
PSA.73.19	How are they become a desolation in a moment!
PSA.73.19	They are utterly consumed with terrors.
PSA.73.20	As a dream when one awaketh;
PSA.73.20	So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
PSA.73.21	For my heart was grieved,
PSA.73.21	And I was pricked in my reins:
PSA.73.22	So brutish was I, and ignorant;
PSA.73.22	I was 
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
PSA.73.23	Thou hast holden my right hand.
PSA.73.24	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
PSA.73.24	And afterward receive me to glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven 
PSA.73.25	And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart faileth:
PSA.73.27	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
PSA.73.27	Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
PSA.73.28	But it is good for me to draw near unto God:
PSA.73.28	I have made the Lord 
PSA.73.28	That I may tell of all thy works.
PSA.74.1	O God, why hast thou cast 
PSA.74.1	Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old,
PSA.74.2	Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance;
PSA.74.3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins,
PSA.74.3	All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly;
PSA.74.4	They have set up their ensigns for signs.
PSA.74.5	They seemed as men that lifted up
PSA.74.5	Axes upon a thicket of trees.
PSA.74.6	And now all the carved work thereof together
PSA.74.6	They break down with hatchet and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have set thy sanctuary on fire;
PSA.74.7	They have profaned the dwelling place of thy name even to the ground.
PSA.74.8	They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
PSA.74.8	They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We see not our signs:
PSA.74.9	There is no more any prophet;
PSA.74.9	Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach?
PSA.74.10	Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
PSA.74.11	Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand?
PSA.74.12	Yet God is my King of old,
PSA.74.12	Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:
PSA.74.13	Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
PSA.74.14	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces,
PSA.74.14	Thou gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
PSA.74.15	Thou didst cleave fountain and flood:
PSA.74.15	Thou driedst up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is thine, the night also is thine:
PSA.74.16	Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
PSA.74.17	Thou hast made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O 
PSA.74.18	And that foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
PSA.74.19	O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast:
PSA.74.19	Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.
PSA.74.20	Have respect unto the covenant:
PSA.74.20	For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
PSA.74.21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed:
PSA.74.21	Let the poor and needy praise thy name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause:
PSA.74.22	Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.
PSA.74.23	Forget not the voice of thine adversaries:
PSA.74.23	The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks unto thee, O God;
PSA.75.1	We give thanks, for thy name is near:
PSA.75.1	Men tell of thy wondrous works.
PSA.75.2	When I shall find the set time,
PSA.75.2	I will judge uprightly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:
PSA.75.3	I have set up the pillars of it. 
PSA.75.4	I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly:
PSA.75.4	And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
PSA.75.5	Lift not up your horn on high;
PSA.75.5	Speak not with a stiff neck.
PSA.75.6	For neither from the east, nor from the west,
PSA.75.6	Nor yet from the south, 
PSA.75.7	But God is the judge:
PSA.75.7	He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.
PSA.75.8	For in the hand of the 
PSA.75.8	It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same:
PSA.75.8	Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
PSA.75.9	But I will declare for ever,
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
PSA.75.10	But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
PSA.76.1	In Judah is God known:
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	In Salem also is his tabernacle,
PSA.76.2	And his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he brake the arrows of the bow;
PSA.76.3	The shield, and the sword, and the battle. 
PSA.76.4	Glorious art thou 
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep;
PSA.76.5	And none of the men of might have found their hands.
PSA.76.6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	Both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared:
PSA.76.7	And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
PSA.76.8	Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven;
PSA.76.8	The earth feared, and was still,
PSA.76.9	When God arose to judgement,
PSA.76.9	To save all the meek of the earth. 
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee:
PSA.76.10	The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.
PSA.76.11	Vow, and pay unto the 
PSA.76.11	Let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes:
PSA.76.12	He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	I will cry unto God with my voice;
PSA.77.1	Even unto God with my voice, and he wilt give ear unto me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:
PSA.77.2	My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not;
PSA.77.2	My soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remember God, and am disquieted:
PSA.77.3	I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. 
PSA.77.4	Thou holdest mine eyes watching:
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old,
PSA.77.5	The years of ancient times.
PSA.77.6	I call to remembrance my song in the night:
PSA.77.6	I commune with mine own heart;
PSA.77.6	And my spirit made diligent search.
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord cast off for ever?
PSA.77.7	And will he be favourable no more?
PSA.77.8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
PSA.77.8	Doth his promise fail for evermore?
PSA.77.9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? 
PSA.77.10	And I said, This is my infirmity;
PSA.77.11	I will make mention of the deeds of the 
PSA.77.11	For I will remember thy wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will meditate also upon all thy work,
PSA.77.12	And muse on thy doings.
PSA.77.13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
PSA.77.13	Who is a great god like unto God?
PSA.77.14	Thou art the God that doest wonders:
PSA.77.14	Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
PSA.77.15	The sons of Jacob and Joseph. 
PSA.77.16	The waters saw thee, O God;
PSA.77.16	The waters saw thee, they were afraid:
PSA.77.16	The depths also trembled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water;
PSA.77.17	The skies sent out a sound:
PSA.77.17	Thine arrows also went abroad.
PSA.77.18	The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind;
PSA.77.18	The lightnings lightened the world:
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Thy way was in the sea,
PSA.77.19	And thy paths in the great waters,
PSA.77.19	And thy footsteps were not known.
PSA.77.20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock,
PSA.77.20	By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, to my law;
PSA.78.1	incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable;
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark sayings of old:
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	And our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children,
PSA.78.4	Telling to the generation to come the praises of the 
PSA.78.4	And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.
PSA.78.5	For he established a testimony in Jacob,
PSA.78.5	And appointed a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	Which he commanded our fathers,
PSA.78.5	That they should make them known to their children:
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know 
PSA.78.6	Who should arise and tell 
PSA.78.7	That they might set their hope in God,
PSA.78.7	And not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	But keep his commandments:
PSA.78.8	And might not be as their fathers,
PSA.78.8	A stubborn and rebellious generation;
PSA.78.8	A generation that set not their heart aright,
PSA.78.8	And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
PSA.78.9	The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
PSA.78.9	Turned back in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They kept not the covenant of God,
PSA.78.10	And refused to walk in his law;
PSA.78.11	And they forgat his doings,
PSA.78.11	And his wondrous works that he had shewed them.
PSA.78.12	Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers,
PSA.78.12	In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through;
PSA.78.13	And he made the waters to stand as an heap.
PSA.78.14	In the day-time also he led them with a cloud,
PSA.78.14	And all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He clave rocks in the wilderness,
PSA.78.15	And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also out of the rock,
PSA.78.16	And caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	Yet went they on still to sin against him,
PSA.78.17	To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
PSA.78.18	And they tempted God in their heart
PSA.78.18	By asking meat for their lust.
PSA.78.19	Yea, they spake against God;
PSA.78.19	They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rock, that waters gushed out,
PSA.78.20	And streams overflowed;
PSA.78.20	Can he give bread also?
PSA.78.20	Will he provide flesh for his people?
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.21	And a fire was kindled against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	And anger also went up against Israel;
PSA.78.22	Because they believed not in God,
PSA.78.22	And trusted not in his salvation.
PSA.78.23	Yet he commanded the skies above,
PSA.78.23	And opened the doors of heaven;
PSA.78.24	And he rained down manna upon them to eat,
PSA.78.24	And gave them of the corn of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man did eat the bread of the mighty:
PSA.78.25	He sent them meat to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heaven:
PSA.78.26	And by his power he guided the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He rained flesh also upon them as the dust,
PSA.78.27	And winged fowl as the sand of the seas:
PSA.78.28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,
PSA.78.28	Round about their habitations.
PSA.78.29	So they did eat, and were well filled;
PSA.78.29	And he gave them that they lusted after.
PSA.78.30	They were not estranged from their lust,
PSA.78.30	Their meat was yet in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	When the anger of God went up against them,
PSA.78.31	And slew of the fattest of them,
PSA.78.31	And smote down the young men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	For all this they sinned still,
PSA.78.32	And believed not in his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
PSA.78.33	And their years in terror.
PSA.78.34	When he slew them, then they inquired after him:
PSA.78.34	And they returned and sought God early.
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	And the Most High God their redeemer.
PSA.78.36	But they flattered him with their mouth,
PSA.78.36	And lied unto him with their tongue.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not right with him,
PSA.78.37	Neither were they faithful in his covenant.
PSA.78.38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave 
PSA.78.38	Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
PSA.78.38	And did not stir up all his wrath.
PSA.78.39	And he remembered that they were but flesh;
PSA.78.39	A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
PSA.78.40	How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness,
PSA.78.40	And grieve him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	And they turned again and tempted God,
PSA.78.41	And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They remembered not his hand,
PSA.78.42	Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary.
PSA.78.43	How he set his signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	And his wonders in the field of Zoan;
PSA.78.44	And turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	And their streams, that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
PSA.78.45	And frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller,
PSA.78.46	And their labour unto the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail,
PSA.78.47	And their sycomore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave over their cattle also to the hail,
PSA.78.48	And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
PSA.78.49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,
PSA.78.49	Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of angels of evil.
PSA.78.50	He made a path for his anger;
PSA.78.50	He spared not their soul from death,
PSA.78.50	But gave their life over to the pestilence;
PSA.78.51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham:
PSA.78.52	But he led forth his own people like sheep,
PSA.78.52	And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	And he led them safely, so that they feared not:
PSA.78.53	But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
PSA.78.54	To this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
PSA.78.55	He drove out the nations also before them,
PSA.78.55	And allotted them for an inheritance by line,
PSA.78.55	And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
PSA.78.56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
PSA.78.56	And kept not his testimonies;
PSA.78.57	But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:
PSA.78.57	They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
PSA.78.58	And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard 
PSA.78.59	And greatly abhorred Israel:
PSA.78.60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	The tent which he placed among men;
PSA.78.61	And delivered his strength into captivity,
PSA.78.61	And his glory into the adversary's hand.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over also unto the sword;
PSA.78.62	And was wroth with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	Fire devoured their young men;
PSA.78.63	And their maidens had no marriage-song.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword;
PSA.78.64	And their widows made no lamentation.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
PSA.78.65	Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
PSA.78.66	And he smote his adversaries backward:
PSA.78.66	He put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA.78.67	Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	The mount Zion which he loved.
PSA.78.69	And he built his sanctuary like the heights,
PSA.78.69	Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David also his servant,
PSA.78.70	And took him from the sheepfolds:
PSA.78.71	From following the ewes that give suck he brought him,
PSA.78.71	To feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
PSA.78.72	And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance;
PSA.79.1	Thy holy temple have they defiled;
PSA.79.1	They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
PSA.79.2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven,
PSA.79.2	The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
PSA.79.3	And there was none to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours,
PSA.79.4	A scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
PSA.79.5	How long, O 
PSA.79.5	Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that know thee not,
PSA.79.6	And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob,
PSA.79.7	And laid waste his habitation.
PSA.79.8	Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers:
PSA.79.8	Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us:
PSA.79.8	For we are brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
PSA.79.9	And deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
PSA.79.10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God?
PSA.79.10	Let the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed
PSA.79.10	Be known among the heathen in our sight.
PSA.79.11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee;
PSA.79.11	According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;
PSA.79.12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
PSA.79.12	Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture
PSA.79.13	Will give thee thanks for ever:
PSA.79.13	We will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
PSA.80.1	Thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth.
PSA.80.2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might,
PSA.80.2	And come to save us.
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, O God;
PSA.80.3	And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.4	How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
PSA.80.5	Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,
PSA.80.5	And given them tears to drink in large measure.
PSA.80.6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours:
PSA.80.6	And our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, O God of hosts;
PSA.80.7	And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.8	Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt:
PSA.80.8	Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
PSA.80.9	Thou preparedst 
PSA.80.9	And it took deep root, and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,
PSA.80.10	And the boughs thereof were 
PSA.80.11	She sent out her branches unto the sea,
PSA.80.11	And her shoots unto the River.
PSA.80.12	Why hast thou broken down her fences,
PSA.80.12	So that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the wood doth ravage it,
PSA.80.13	And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts:
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
PSA.80.15	And the stock which thy right hand hath planted,
PSA.80.15	And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
PSA.80.16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
PSA.80.16	They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
PSA.80.17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
PSA.80.17	Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
PSA.80.18	So shall we not go back from thee:
PSA.80.18	Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name,
PSA.80.19	Turn us again, O 
PSA.80.19	Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud unto God our strength:
PSA.81.1	Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Take up the psalm, and bring hither the timbrel,
PSA.81.2	The pleasant harp with the psaltery.
PSA.81.3	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon,
PSA.81.3	At the full moon, on our solemn feast day.
PSA.81.4	For it is a statute for Israel,
PSA.81.4	An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He appointed it in Joseph for testimony,
PSA.81.5	When he went out over the land of Egypt:
PSA.81.6	I removed his shoulder from the burden:
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the basket.
PSA.81.7	Thou calledst in trouble,
PSA.81.7	And I answered thee in the secret place of thunder;
PSA.81.7	I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. 
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!
PSA.81.9	There shall no strange god be in thee;
PSA.81.9	Neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	Which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt:
PSA.81.10	Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	But my people hearkened not to my voice;
PSA.81.11	And Israel would none of me.
PSA.81.12	So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart,
PSA.81.12	That they might walk in their own counsels.
PSA.81.13	Oh that my people would hearken unto me,
PSA.81.13	That Israel would walk in my ways!
PSA.81.14	I should soon subdue their enemies,
PSA.81.14	And turn my hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the 
PSA.81.15	But their time should endure for ever.
PSA.81.16	He should feed them also with the finest of the wheat:
PSA.81.16	And with honey out of the rock should I satisfy thee.
PSA.82.1	God standeth in the congregation of God;
PSA.82.1	He judgeth among the gods.
PSA.82.2	How long will ye judge unjustly,
PSA.82.2	And respect the persons of the wicked? 
PSA.82.3	Judge the poor and fatherless:
PSA.82.3	Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the poor and needy:
PSA.82.4	Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
PSA.82.5	They know not, neither do they understand;
PSA.82.5	They walk to and fro in darkness:
PSA.82.5	All the foundations of the earth are moved.
PSA.82.6	I said, Ye are gods,
PSA.82.6	And all of you sons of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	Nevertheless ye shall die like men,
PSA.82.7	And fall like one of the princes.
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth:
PSA.82.8	For thou shalt inherit all the nations.
PSA.83.1	O God, keep not thou silence:
PSA.83.1	Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
PSA.83.2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult:
PSA.83.2	And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
PSA.83.3	They take crafty counsel against thy people,
PSA.83.3	And consult together against thy hidden ones.
PSA.83.4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
PSA.83.4	That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
PSA.83.5	For they have consulted together with one consent;
PSA.83.5	Against thee do they make a covenant:
PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
PSA.83.8	Assyria also is joined with them;
PSA.83.8	They have holpen the children of Lot. 
PSA.83.9	Do thou unto them as unto Midian;
PSA.83.9	As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon:
PSA.83.10	Which perished at En-dor;
PSA.83.10	They became as dung for the earth.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
PSA.83.11	Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna:
PSA.83.12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession
PSA.83.12	The habitations of God.
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like the whirling dust;
PSA.83.13	As stubble before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As the fire that burneth the forest,
PSA.83.14	And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire;
PSA.83.15	So pursue them with thy tempest,
PSA.83.15	And terrify them with thy storm.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with confusion;
PSA.83.16	That they may seek thy name, O 
PSA.83.17	Let them be ashamed and dismayed for ever;
PSA.83.17	Yea, let them be confounded and perish:
PSA.83.18	That they may know that thou alone,
PSA.83.18	Whose name is 
PSA.84.1	How amiable are thy tabernacles,
PSA.84.1	O 
PSA.84.2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God.
PSA.84.3	Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house,
PSA.84.3	And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,
PSA.84.3	Even thine altars, O 
PSA.84.3	My King, and my God.
PSA.84.4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
PSA.84.4	They will be still praising thee. 
PSA.84.5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee;
PSA.84.5	In whose heart are the highways 
PSA.84.6	Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs;
PSA.84.6	Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength,
PSA.84.7	Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.8	Give ear, O God of Jacob. 
PSA.84.9	Behold, O God our shield,
PSA.84.9	And look upon the face of thine anointed.
PSA.84.10	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.
PSA.84.10	I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
PSA.84.10	Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.84.12	Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
PSA.85.1	Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people,
PSA.85.2	Thou hast covered all their sin. 
PSA.85.3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath:
PSA.85.3	Thou hast turned 
PSA.85.4	Turn us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Wilt thou not quicken us again:
PSA.85.6	That thy people may rejoice in thee?
PSA.85.7	Shew us thy mercy, O 
PSA.85.7	And grant us thy salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God the 
PSA.85.8	For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints:
PSA.85.8	But let them not turn again to folly.
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him;
PSA.85.9	That glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Mercy and truth are met together;
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
PSA.85.11	Truth springeth out of the earth;
PSA.85.11	And righteousness hath looked clown from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Yea, the 
PSA.85.12	And our land shall yield her increase.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness shall go before him;
PSA.85.13	And shall make his footsteps a way 
PSA.86.1	Bow down thine ear, O 
PSA.86.1	For I am poor and needy.
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul; for I am godly:
PSA.86.2	O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
PSA.86.3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord;
PSA.86.3	For unto thee do I cry all the day long.
PSA.86.4	Rejoice the soul of thy servant;
PSA.86.4	For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive,
PSA.86.5	And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O 
PSA.86.6	And hearken unto the voice of my supplications.
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee;
PSA.86.7	For thou wilt answer me.
PSA.86.8	There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord;
PSA.86.8	Neither 
PSA.86.9	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord;
PSA.86.9	And they shall glorify thy name.
PSA.86.10	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things:
PSA.86.10	Thou art God alone.
PSA.86.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.86.11	Unite my heart to fear thy name.
PSA.86.12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart;
PSA.86.12	And I will glorify thy name for evermore.
PSA.86.13	For great is thy mercy toward me;
PSA.86.13	And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest pit.
PSA.86.14	O God, the proud are risen up against me,
PSA.86.14	And the congregation of violent men have sought after my soul,
PSA.86.14	And have not set thee before them.
PSA.86.15	But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious,
PSA.86.15	Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
PSA.86.16	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me;
PSA.86.16	Give thy strength unto thy servant,
PSA.86.16	And save the son of thine handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Shew me a token for good;
PSA.86.17	That they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed,
PSA.86.17	Because thou, 
PSA.87.1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.2	More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. 
PSA.87.4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me:
PSA.87.4	Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia;
PSA.87.4	This one was born there.
PSA.87.5	Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her;
PSA.87.5	And the Most High himself shall establish her.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	This one was born there. 
PSA.87.7	They that sing as well as they that dance 
PSA.87.7	All my fountains are in thee.
PSA.88.1	O 
PSA.88.1	I have cried day and night before thee:
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer enter into thy presence;
PSA.88.2	Incline thine ear unto my cry:
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full of troubles,
PSA.88.3	And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.
PSA.88.4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit;
PSA.88.4	I am as a man that hath no help:
PSA.88.5	Cast off among the dead,
PSA.88.5	Like the slain that lie in the grave,
PSA.88.5	Whom thou rememberest no more;
PSA.88.5	And they are cut off from thy hand.
PSA.88.6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	In dark places, in the deeps.
PSA.88.7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
PSA.88.7	And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. 
PSA.88.8	Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me;
PSA.88.8	Thou hast made me an abomination unto them:
PSA.88.8	I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
PSA.88.9	Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction:
PSA.88.9	I have called daily upon thee, O 
PSA.88.9	I have spread forth my hands unto thee.
PSA.88.10	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?
PSA.88.10	Shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? 
PSA.88.11	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?
PSA.88.11	Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?
PSA.88.12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
PSA.88.12	And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But unto thee, O 
PSA.88.13	And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
PSA.88.14	Why hidest thou thy face from me?
PSA.88.15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up:
PSA.88.15	While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
PSA.88.16	Thy fierce wrath is gone over me;
PSA.88.16	Thy terrors have cut me off.
PSA.88.17	They came round about me like water all the day long;
PSA.88.17	They compassed me about together.
PSA.88.18	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,
PSA.88.18	And mine acquaintance into darkness.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the mercies of the 
PSA.89.1	With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
PSA.89.2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever;
PSA.89.2	Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
PSA.89.3	I have made a covenant with my chosen,
PSA.89.3	I have sworn unto David my servant;
PSA.89.4	Thy seed will I establish for ever,
PSA.89.4	And build up thy throne to all generations. 
PSA.89.5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O 
PSA.89.5	Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	For who in the skies can be compared unto the 
PSA.89.6	Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto the 
PSA.89.7	A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones,
PSA.89.7	And to be feared above all them that are round about him?
PSA.89.8	O 
PSA.89.8	Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O 
PSA.89.8	And thy faithfulness is round about thee.
PSA.89.9	Thou rulest the pride of the sea:
PSA.89.9	When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
PSA.89.10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
PSA.89.10	Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
PSA.89.11	The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
PSA.89.12	The north and the south, thou hast created them:
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.
PSA.89.13	Thou hast a mighty arm:
PSA.89.13	Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and judgement are the foundation of thy throne:
PSA.89.14	Mercy and truth go before thy face.
PSA.89.15	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
PSA.89.15	They walk, O 
PSA.89.16	In thy name do they rejoice all the day:
PSA.89.16	And in thy righteousness are they exalted.
PSA.89.17	For thou art the glory of their strength:
PSA.89.17	And in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
PSA.89.18	For our shield belongeth unto the 
PSA.89.18	And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints,
PSA.89.19	And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
PSA.89.19	I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David my servant;
PSA.89.20	With my holy oil have I anointed him:
PSA.89.21	With whom my hand shall be established;
PSA.89.21	Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy shall not exact upon him;
PSA.89.22	Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
PSA.89.23	And I will beat down his adversaries before him,
PSA.89.23	And smite them that hate him.
PSA.89.24	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him;
PSA.89.24	And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand also on the sea,
PSA.89.25	And his right hand on the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father,
PSA.89.26	My God, and the rock of my salvation.
PSA.89.27	I also will make him 
PSA.89.27	The highest of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
PSA.89.28	And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
PSA.89.29	His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
PSA.89.29	And his throne as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	If his children forsake my law,
PSA.89.30	And walk not in my judgements;
PSA.89.31	If they break my statutes,
PSA.89.31	And keep not my commandments;
PSA.89.32	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
PSA.89.32	And their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	But my mercy will I not utterly take from him,
PSA.89.33	Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
PSA.89.34	My covenant will I not break,
PSA.89.34	Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
PSA.89.35	Once have I sworn by my holiness;
PSA.89.35	I will not lie unto David;
PSA.89.36	His seed shall endure for ever,
PSA.89.36	And his throne as the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established for ever as the moon,
PSA.89.37	And 
PSA.89.38	But thou hast cast off and rejected,
PSA.89.38	Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
PSA.89.39	Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant:
PSA.89.39	Thou hast profaned his crown 
PSA.89.40	Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
PSA.89.40	Thou hast brought his strong holds to rain.
PSA.89.41	All that pass by the way spoil him:
PSA.89.41	He is become a reproach to his neighbours.
PSA.89.42	Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
PSA.89.42	Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Yea, thou turnest back the edge his sword,
PSA.89.43	And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
PSA.89.44	Thou hast made his brightness to cease,
PSA.89.44	And cast his throne down to the ground.
PSA.89.45	The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
PSA.89.45	Thou hast covered him with shame. 
PSA.89.46	How long, O 
PSA.89.47	O remember how short my time is:
PSA.89.47	For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!
PSA.89.48	What man is he that shall live and not see death,
PSA.89.48	That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? 
PSA.89.49	Lord, where are thy former mercies,
PSA.89.49	Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants;
PSA.89.50	How I do bear in my bosom 
PSA.89.51	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O 
PSA.89.51	Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the 
PSA.89.52	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place
PSA.90.1	In all generations.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were brought forth,
PSA.90.2	Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
PSA.90.3	Thou turnest man to destruction;
PSA.90.3	And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in thy sight
PSA.90.4	Are but as yesterday when it is past,
PSA.90.4	And as a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
PSA.90.5	In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
PSA.90.6	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
PSA.90.6	In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed in thine anger,
PSA.90.7	And in thy wrath are we troubled.
PSA.90.8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
PSA.90.8	Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
PSA.90.9	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
PSA.90.9	We bring our years to an end as a tale 
PSA.90.10	The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
PSA.90.10	Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
PSA.90.10	Yet is their pride but labour and sorrow;
PSA.90.10	For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who knoweth the power of thine anger,
PSA.90.11	And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days,
PSA.90.12	That we may get us an heart of wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Return, O 
PSA.90.13	And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us in the morning with thy mercy;
PSA.90.14	That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
PSA.90.15	And the years wherein we have seen evil.
PSA.90.16	Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
PSA.90.16	And thy glory upon their children.
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the 
PSA.90.17	And establish thou the work of our hands upon us;
PSA.90.17	Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
PSA.91.1	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
PSA.91.1	Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.2	My God, in whom I trust.
PSA.91.3	For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
PSA.91.3	And from the noisome pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He shall cover thee with his pinions,
PSA.91.4	And under his wings shalt thou take refuge:
PSA.91.4	His truth is a shield and a buckler.
PSA.91.5	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night,
PSA.91.5	Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
PSA.91.6	For the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
PSA.91.6	Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
PSA.91.7	A thousand shall fall at thy side,
PSA.91.7	And ten thousand at thy right hand;
PSA.91.8	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,
PSA.91.8	And see the reward of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	For thou, O 
PSA.91.9	Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation;
PSA.91.10	There shall no evil befall thee,
PSA.91.10	Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
PSA.91.11	For he shall give his angels charge over thee,
PSA.91.11	To keep thee in all thy ways.
PSA.91.12	They shall bear thee up in their hands,
PSA.91.12	Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
PSA.91.13	The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet.
PSA.91.14	Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
PSA.91.14	I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
PSA.91.15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble:
PSA.91.15	I will deliver him, and honour him.
PSA.91.16	With long life will I satisfy him,
PSA.91.16	And shew him my salvation.
PSA.92.1	It is a good thing to give thanks unto the 
PSA.92.1	And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High:
PSA.92.2	To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
PSA.92.2	And thy faithfulness every night,
PSA.92.3	With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery;
PSA.92.3	With a solemn sound upon the harp.
PSA.92.4	For thou, 
PSA.92.4	I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
PSA.92.5	How great are thy works, O 
PSA.92.5	Thy thoughts are very deep.
PSA.92.6	A brutish man knoweth not;
PSA.92.6	Neither doth a fool understand this:
PSA.92.7	When the wicked spring as the grass,
PSA.92.7	And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
PSA.92.7	It is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
PSA.92.8	But thou, O 
PSA.92.9	For, lo, thine enemies, O 
PSA.92.9	For, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
PSA.92.9	All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But my horn hast thou exalted like 
PSA.92.10	I am anointed with fresh oil.
PSA.92.11	Mine eye also hath seen 
PSA.92.11	Mine ears have heard 
PSA.92.12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree:
PSA.92.12	He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	They that are planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.13	Shall flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
PSA.92.14	They shall be full of sap and green:
PSA.92.15	To shew that the 
PSA.92.15	He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	The world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
PSA.93.2	Thy throne is established of old:
PSA.93.2	Thou art from everlasting.
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, O 
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up their voice;
PSA.93.3	The floods lift up their waves.
PSA.93.4	Above the voices of many waters,
PSA.93.4	The mighty breakers of the sea,
PSA.93.4	The 
PSA.93.5	Thy testimonies are very sure:
PSA.93.5	Holiness becometh thine house,
PSA.93.5	O 
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.1	Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
PSA.94.2	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
PSA.94.2	Render to the proud 
PSA.94.3	How long shall the wicked triumph?
PSA.94.4	They prate, they speak arrogantly:
PSA.94.4	All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
PSA.94.5	They break in pieces thy people, O 
PSA.94.5	And afflict thine heritage.
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the stranger,
PSA.94.6	And murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	And they say, The 
PSA.94.7	Neither shall the God of Jacob consider.
PSA.94.8	Consider, ye brutish among the people:
PSA.94.8	And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
PSA.94.9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
PSA.94.9	He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
PSA.94.10	He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct,
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.11	That they are vanity.
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O 
PSA.94.12	And teachest out of thy law;
PSA.94.13	That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
PSA.94.13	Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.14	Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
PSA.94.15	For judgement shall return unto righteousness:
PSA.94.15	And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.17	My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
PSA.94.18	When I said, My foot slippeth;
PSA.94.18	Thy mercy, O 
PSA.94.19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me
PSA.94.19	Thy comforts delight my soul.
PSA.94.20	Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee,
PSA.94.20	Which frameth mischief by statute?
PSA.94.21	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
PSA.94.21	And condemn the innocent blood.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	And my God the rock of my refuge.
PSA.94.23	And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity,
PSA.94.23	And shall cut them off in their own evil;
PSA.94.23	the 
PSA.95.1	O come, let us sing unto the 
PSA.95.1	Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
PSA.95.2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
PSA.95.2	Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.3	And a great King above all gods.
PSA.95.4	In his hand are the deep places of the earth;
PSA.95.4	The heights of the mountains are his also.
PSA.95.5	The sea is his, and he made it;
PSA.95.5	And his hands formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	O come, let us worship and bow down;
PSA.95.6	Let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	For he is our God,
PSA.95.7	And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
PSA.95.7	Today, Oh that ye would hear his voice!
PSA.95.8	Harden not your heart, as at Meribah,
PSA.95.8	As in the day of Massah in the wilderness:
PSA.95.9	When your fathers tempted me,
PSA.95.9	Proved me, and saw my work.
PSA.95.10	Forty years long was I grieved with 
PSA.95.10	And said, It is a people that do err in their heart,
PSA.95.10	And they have not known my ways:
PSA.95.11	Wherefore I sware in my wrath,
PSA.95.11	That they should not enter into my rest.
PSA.96.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.96.1	Sing unto the 
PSA.96.2	Sing unto the 
PSA.96.2	Shew forth his salvation from day to day.
PSA.96.3	Declare his glory among the nations,
PSA.96.3	His marvelous works among all the peoples.
PSA.96.4	For great is the 
PSA.96.4	He is to be feared above all gods.
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the peoples are idols:
PSA.96.5	But the 
PSA.96.6	Honour and majesty are before him:
PSA.96.6	Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
PSA.96.7	Give unto the 
PSA.96.7	Give unto the 
PSA.96.8	Give unto the 
PSA.96.8	Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
PSA.96.9	O worship the 
PSA.96.9	Tremble before him, all the earth.
PSA.96.10	Say among the nations, The 
PSA.96.10	The world also is stablished that it cannot be moved:
PSA.96.10	He shall judge the peoples with equity.
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
PSA.96.11	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
PSA.96.12	Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
PSA.96.12	Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy;
PSA.96.13	Before the 
PSA.96.13	For he cometh to judge the earth:
PSA.96.13	He shall judge the world with righteousness,
PSA.96.13	And the peoples with his truth.
PSA.97.1	The 
PSA.97.1	Let the multitude of isles be glad.
PSA.97.2	Clouds and darkness are round about him:
PSA.97.2	Righteousness and judgement are the foundation of his throne.
PSA.97.3	A fire goeth before him,
PSA.97.3	And burneth up his adversaries round about.
PSA.97.4	His lightnings lightened the world:
PSA.97.4	The earth saw, and trembled.
PSA.97.5	The hills melted like wax at the presence of the 
PSA.97.5	At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
PSA.97.6	The heavens declare his righteousness,
PSA.97.6	And all the peoples have seen his glory.
PSA.97.7	Ashamed be all they that serve graven images,
PSA.97.7	That boast themselves of idols:
PSA.97.7	Worship him, all ye gods.
PSA.97.8	Zion heard and was glad,
PSA.97.8	And the daughters of Judah rejoiced;
PSA.97.8	Because of thy judgements, O 
PSA.97.9	For thou, 
PSA.97.9	Thou art exalted far above all gods.
PSA.97.10	O ye that love the 
PSA.97.10	He preserveth the souls of his saints;
PSA.97.10	He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
PSA.97.11	Light is sown for the righteous,
PSA.97.11	And gladness for the upright in heart.
PSA.97.12	Be glad in the 
PSA.97.12	And give thanks to his holy name.
PSA.98.1	Sing unto the 
PSA.98.1	For he hath done marvelous things:
PSA.98.1	His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.
PSA.98.2	The 
PSA.98.2	His righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations.
PSA.98.3	He hath remembered his mercy and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel:
PSA.98.3	All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
PSA.98.4	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.98.4	Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
PSA.98.5	Sing praises unto the 
PSA.98.5	With the harp and the voice of melody.
PSA.98.6	With trumpets and sound of cornet
PSA.98.6	Make a joyful noise before the King, the 
PSA.98.7	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
PSA.98.7	The world, and they that dwell therein;
PSA.98.8	Let the floods clap their hands;
PSA.98.8	Let the hills sing for joy together;
PSA.98.9	Before the 
PSA.98.9	He shall judge the world with righteousness,
PSA.98.9	And the peoples with equity.
PSA.99.1	The 
PSA.99.1	He sitteth upon the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
PSA.99.2	The 
PSA.99.2	And he is high above all the peoples.
PSA.99.3	Let them praise thy great and terrible name:
PSA.99.3	Holy is he.
PSA.99.4	The king's strength also loveth judgement;
PSA.99.4	Thou dost establish equity,
PSA.99.4	Thou executest judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
PSA.99.5	Exalt ye the 
PSA.99.5	And worship at his footstool:
PSA.99.5	Holy is he.
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron among his priests,
PSA.99.6	And Samuel among them that call on his name;
PSA.99.6	They called upon the 
PSA.99.7	He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud:
PSA.99.7	They kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them.
PSA.99.8	Thou answeredst them, O 
PSA.99.8	Thou wast a God that forgavest them,
PSA.99.8	Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
PSA.99.9	Exalt ye the 
PSA.99.9	And worship at his holy hill;
PSA.99.9	For the 
PSA.100.1	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.100.2	Serve the 
PSA.100.2	Come before his presence with singing.
PSA.100.3	Know ye that the 
PSA.100.3	It is he that hath made us, and we are his;
PSA.100.3	We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
PSA.100.4	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
PSA.100.4	And into his courts with praise:
PSA.100.4	Give thanks unto him, and bless his name.
PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.100.5	And his faithfulness unto all generations.
PSA.101.1	I will sing of mercy and judgement:
PSA.101.1	Unto thee, O 
PSA.101.2	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way:
PSA.101.2	Oh when wilt thou come unto me?
PSA.101.2	I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
PSA.101.3	I will set no base thing before mine eyes:
PSA.101.3	I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave unto me.
PSA.101.4	A froward heart shall depart from me:
PSA.101.4	I will know no evil thing.
PSA.101.5	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy:
PSA.101.5	Him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
PSA.101.6	Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me:
PSA.101.6	He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.
PSA.101.7	He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house:
PSA.101.7	He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
PSA.101.8	Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;
PSA.101.8	To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.102.1	And let my cry come unto thee.
PSA.102.2	Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress:
PSA.102.2	Incline thine ear unto me;
PSA.102.2	In the day when I call answer me speedily.
PSA.102.3	For my days consume away like smoke,
PSA.102.3	And my bones are burned as a firebrand.
PSA.102.4	My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;
PSA.102.4	For I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of the voice of my groaning
PSA.102.5	My bones cleave to my flesh.
PSA.102.6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
PSA.102.6	I am become as an owl of the waste places.
PSA.102.7	I watch, and am become
PSA.102.7	Like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.
PSA.102.8	Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
PSA.102.8	They that are mad against me do curse by me.
PSA.102.9	For I have eaten ashes like bread,
PSA.102.9	And mingled my drink with weeping.
PSA.102.10	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath:
PSA.102.10	For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.
PSA.102.11	My days are like a shadow that declineth;
PSA.102.11	And I am withered like grass.
PSA.102.12	But thou, O 
PSA.102.12	And thy memorial unto all generations.
PSA.102.13	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion:
PSA.102.13	For it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time is come.
PSA.102.14	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
PSA.102.14	And have pity upon her dust.
PSA.102.15	So the nations shall fear the name of the 
PSA.102.15	And all the kings of the earth thy glory:
PSA.102.16	For the 
PSA.102.16	He hath appeared in his glory;
PSA.102.17	He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute,
PSA.102.17	And hath not despised their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This shall be written for the generation to come:
PSA.102.18	And a people which shall be created shall praise the 
PSA.102.19	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
PSA.102.19	From heaven did the 
PSA.102.20	To hear the sighing of the prisoner;
PSA.102.20	To loose those that are appointed to death;
PSA.102.21	That men may declare the name of the 
PSA.102.21	And his praise in Jerusalem;
PSA.102.22	When the peoples are gathered together,
PSA.102.22	And the kingdoms, to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He weakened my strength in the way;
PSA.102.23	He shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
PSA.102.24	Thy years are throughout all generations.
PSA.102.25	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth;
PSA.102.25	And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
PSA.102.26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:
PSA.102.26	Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
PSA.102.26	As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
PSA.102.27	But thou art the same,
PSA.102.27	And thy years shall have no end.
PSA.102.28	The children of thy servants shall continue,
PSA.102.28	And their seed shall be established before thee.
PSA.103.1	Bless the 
PSA.103.1	And all that is within me, 
PSA.103.2	Bless the 
PSA.103.2	And forget not all his benefits:
PSA.103.3	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
PSA.103.3	Who healeth all thy diseases;
PSA.103.4	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
PSA.103.4	Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies:
PSA.103.5	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	And judgements for all that are oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways unto Moses,
PSA.103.7	His doings unto the children of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.8	Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
PSA.103.9	He will not always chide;
PSA.103.9	Neither will he keep 
PSA.103.10	He hath not dealt with us after our sins,
PSA.103.10	Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heaven is high above the earth,
PSA.103.11	So great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	Like as a father pitieth his children,
PSA.103.13	So the 
PSA.103.14	For he knoweth our frame;
PSA.103.14	He remembereth that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are as grass;
PSA.103.15	As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
PSA.103.16	And the place thereof shall know it no more.
PSA.103.17	But the mercy of the 
PSA.103.17	And his righteousness unto children's children;
PSA.103.18	To such as keep his covenant,
PSA.103.18	And to those that remember his precepts to do them.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	And his kingdom ruleth over all.
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.20	Ye mighty in strength, that fulfill his word,
PSA.103.20	Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
PSA.103.21	Bless the 
PSA.103.21	Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.103.22	In all places of his dominion:
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	O 
PSA.104.1	Thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
PSA.104.2	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment;
PSA.104.2	Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
PSA.104.3	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters;
PSA.104.3	Who maketh the clouds his chariot;
PSA.104.3	Who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
PSA.104.4	Who maketh winds his messengers;
PSA.104.4	His ministers a flaming fire:
PSA.104.5	Who laid the foundations of the earth,
PSA.104.5	That it should not be moved for ever.
PSA.104.6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
PSA.104.6	The waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At thy rebuke they fled;
PSA.104.7	At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away;
PSA.104.8	They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys,
PSA.104.8	Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
PSA.104.9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
PSA.104.9	That they turn not again to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;
PSA.104.10	They run among the mountains:
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field;
PSA.104.11	The wild asses quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	By them the fowl of the heaven have their habitation,
PSA.104.12	They sing among the branches.
PSA.104.13	He watereth the mountains from his chambers:
PSA.104.13	The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
PSA.104.14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
PSA.104.14	And herb for the service of man;
PSA.104.14	That he may bring forth food out of the earth:
PSA.104.15	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
PSA.104.15	And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
PSA.104.17	Where the birds make their nests:
PSA.104.17	As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats;
PSA.104.18	The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
PSA.104.19	He appointed the moon for seasons:
PSA.104.19	The sun knoweth his going down.
PSA.104.20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night;
PSA.104.20	Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey,
PSA.104.21	And seek their meat from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun ariseth, they get them away,
PSA.104.22	And lay them down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goeth forth unto his work
PSA.104.23	And to his labour until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom hast thou made them all:
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of thy riches.
PSA.104.25	Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
PSA.104.25	Wherein are things creeping innumerable,
PSA.104.25	Both small and great beasts.
PSA.104.26	There go the ships;
PSA.104.26	There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to take his pastime therein.
PSA.104.27	These wait all upon thee,
PSA.104.27	That thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
PSA.104.28	That thou givest unto them they gather;
PSA.104.28	Thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good.
PSA.104.29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled;
PSA.104.29	Thou takest away their breath they die,
PSA.104.29	And return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created;
PSA.104.30	And thou renewest the face of the ground.
PSA.104.31	Let the glory of the 
PSA.104.31	Let the 
PSA.104.32	Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
PSA.104.32	He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing unto the 
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
PSA.104.34	Let my meditation be sweet unto him:
PSA.104.34	I will rejoice in the 
PSA.104.35	Let sinners be consumed out of the earth,
PSA.104.35	And let the wicked be no more.
PSA.104.35	Bless the 
PSA.104.35	Praise ye the 
PSA.105.1	Give thanks unto the 
PSA.105.1	Make known his doings among the peoples.
PSA.105.2	Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
PSA.105.2	Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
PSA.105.3	Glory ye in his holy name:
PSA.105.3	Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek ye the 
PSA.105.4	Seek his face evermore.
PSA.105.5	Remember his marvelous works that he hath done;
PSA.105.5	His wonders, and the judgements of his mouth;
PSA.105.6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
PSA.105.6	Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.7	His judgements are in all the earth.
PSA.105.8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
PSA.105.8	The word which he commanded to a thousand generations;
PSA.105.9	And his oath unto Isaac;
PSA.105.10	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,
PSA.105.10	To Israel for an everlasting covenant:
PSA.105.11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
PSA.105.11	The lot of your inheritance:
PSA.105.12	When they were but a few men in number;
PSA.105.12	Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;
PSA.105.13	And they went about from nation to nation,
PSA.105.13	From one kingdom to another people.
PSA.105.14	He suffered no man to do them wrong;
PSA.105.14	Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
PSA.105.15	And do my prophets no harm.
PSA.105.16	And he called for a famine upon the land;
PSA.105.16	He brake the whole staff of bread.
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them;
PSA.105.17	Joseph was sold for a servant:
PSA.105.18	His feet they hurt with fetters;
PSA.105.18	He was laid in 
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word came to pass;
PSA.105.19	The word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and loosed him;
PSA.105.20	Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house,
PSA.105.21	And ruler of all his substance:
PSA.105.22	To bind his princes at his pleasure,
PSA.105.22	And teach his senators wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Israel also came into Egypt;
PSA.105.23	And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And he increased his people greatly,
PSA.105.24	And made them stronger than their adversaries.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people,
PSA.105.25	To deal subtilly with his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses his servant,
PSA.105.27	They set among them his signs,
PSA.105.27	And wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and made it dark;
PSA.105.28	And they rebelled not against his words.
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood,
PSA.105.29	And slew their fish.
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs,
PSA.105.30	In the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spake, and there came swarms of flies,
PSA.105.31	And lice in all their borders.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees;
PSA.105.33	And brake the trees of their borders.
PSA.105.34	He spake, and the locust came,
PSA.105.34	And the cankerworm, and that without number,
PSA.105.35	And did eat up every herb in their land,
PSA.105.35	And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	The chief of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	And he brought them forth with silver and gold:
PSA.105.37	And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed;
PSA.105.38	For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering;
PSA.105.39	And fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and he brought quails,
PSA.105.40	And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;
PSA.105.41	They ran in the dry places 
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy word,
PSA.105.43	And he brought forth his people with joy,
PSA.105.44	And he gave them the lands of the nations;
PSA.105.44	And they took the labour of the peoples in possession:
PSA.105.45	That they might keep his statutes,
PSA.105.45	And observe his laws.
PSA.105.45	Praise ye the 
PSA.106.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.106.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.106.1	For his mercy 
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.2	Or shew forth all his praise?
PSA.106.3	Blessed are they that keep judgement,
PSA.106.3	And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.4	O visit me with thy salvation:
PSA.106.5	That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen,
PSA.106.5	That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,
PSA.106.5	That I may glory with thine inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers,
PSA.106.6	We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;
PSA.106.7	They remembered not the multitude of thy mercies;
PSA.106.7	But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,
PSA.106.8	That he might make his mighty power to be known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:
PSA.106.9	So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
PSA.106.10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
PSA.106.10	And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their adversaries:
PSA.106.11	There was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	Then believed they his words;
PSA.106.12	They sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgat his works;
PSA.106.13	They waited not for his counsel:
PSA.106.14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
PSA.106.14	And tempted God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	And he gave them their request;
PSA.106.15	But sent leanness into their soul.
PSA.106.16	They envied Moses also in the camp,
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
PSA.106.17	And covered the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	And a fire was kindled in their company;
PSA.106.18	The flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb,
PSA.106.19	And worshipped a molten image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they changed their glory
PSA.106.20	For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgat God their saviour,
PSA.106.21	Which had done great things in Egypt;
PSA.106.22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
PSA.106.23	Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
PSA.106.23	To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy 
PSA.106.24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
PSA.106.24	They believed not his word;
PSA.106.25	But murmured in their tents,
PSA.106.25	And hearkened not unto the voice of the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore he lifted up his hand unto them,
PSA.106.26	That he would overthrow them in the wilderness:
PSA.106.27	And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,
PSA.106.27	And scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,
PSA.106.28	And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;
PSA.106.29	And the plague brake in upon them.
PSA.106.30	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgement:
PSA.106.30	And so the plague was stayed.
PSA.106.31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness,
PSA.106.31	Unto all generations for evermore.
PSA.106.32	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
PSA.106.32	So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
PSA.106.33	Because they were rebellious against his spirit,
PSA.106.33	And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples,
PSA.106.34	As the 
PSA.106.35	But mingled themselves with the nations,
PSA.106.35	And learned their works:
PSA.106.36	And they served their idols;
PSA.106.36	Which became a snare unto them:
PSA.106.37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
PSA.106.38	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
PSA.106.38	Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;
PSA.106.38	And the land was polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus were they defiled with their works,
PSA.106.39	And went a whoring in their doings.
PSA.106.40	Therefore was the wrath of the 
PSA.106.40	And he abhorred his inheritance.
PSA.106.41	And he gave them into the hand of the nations;
PSA.106.41	And they that hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	Many times did he deliver them;
PSA.106.43	But they were rebellious in their counsel,
PSA.106.43	And were brought low in their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he regarded their distress,
PSA.106.44	When he heard their cry:
PSA.106.45	And he remembered for them his covenant,
PSA.106.45	And repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
PSA.106.46	He made them also to be pitied
PSA.106.46	Of all those that carried them captives.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O 
PSA.106.47	And gather us from among the nations,
PSA.106.47	To give thanks unto thy holy name,
PSA.106.47	And to triumph in thy praise.
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the 
PSA.106.48	From everlasting even to everlasting.
PSA.106.48	And let all the people say, Amen.
PSA.106.48	Praise ye the 
PSA.107.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.107.1	For his mercy 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.2	Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;
PSA.107.3	And gathered them out of the lands,
PSA.107.3	From the east and from the west,
PSA.107.3	From the north and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
PSA.107.4	They found no city of habitation.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	Their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.6	And he delivered them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.7	He led them also by a straight way,
PSA.107.7	That they might go to a city of habitation.
PSA.107.8	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.8	And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
PSA.107.9	For he satisfieth the longing soul,
PSA.107.9	And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
PSA.107.10	Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
PSA.107.10	Being bound in affliction and iron;
PSA.107.11	Because they rebelled against the words of God,
PSA.107.11	And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
PSA.107.12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour;
PSA.107.12	They fell down, and there was none to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.13	And he saved them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
PSA.107.14	And brake their bands in sunder.
PSA.107.15	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.15	And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
PSA.107.16	For he hath broken the gates of brass,
PSA.107.16	And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
PSA.107.17	Fools because of their transgression,
PSA.107.17	And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat;
PSA.107.18	And they draw near unto the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.19	And he saveth them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.20	He sendeth his word, and healeth them,
PSA.107.20	And delivereth 
PSA.107.21	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.21	And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
PSA.107.22	And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	And declare his works with singing.
PSA.107.23	They that go down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	That do business in great waters;
PSA.107.24	These see the works of the 
PSA.107.24	And his wonders in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
PSA.107.25	Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
PSA.107.26	Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
PSA.107.27	And are at their wits' end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.28	And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.29	He maketh the storm a calm,
PSA.107.29	So that the waves thereof are still.
PSA.107.30	Then are they glad because they be quiet:
PSA.107.30	So he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.
PSA.107.31	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.31	And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
PSA.107.32	And praise him in the seat of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
PSA.107.33	And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
PSA.107.34	A fruitful land into a salt desert,
PSA.107.34	For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
PSA.107.35	He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
PSA.107.35	And a dry land into watersprings.
PSA.107.36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
PSA.107.36	That they may prepare a city of habitation;
PSA.107.37	And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	And get them fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
PSA.107.38	And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again, they are minished and bowed down
PSA.107.39	Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
PSA.107.40	He poureth contempt upon princes,
PSA.107.40	And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
PSA.107.41	Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction,
PSA.107.41	And maketh 
PSA.107.42	The upright shall see it, and be glad;
PSA.107.42	And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
PSA.107.43	Whoso is wise shall give heed to these things,
PSA.107.43	And they shall consider the mercies of the 
PSA.108.1	My heart is fixed, O God;
PSA.108.1	I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
PSA.108.2	Awake, psaltery and harp:
PSA.108.2	I myself will awake right early.
PSA.108.3	I will give thanks unto thee, O 
PSA.108.3	And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For thy mercy is great above the heavens,
PSA.108.4	And thy truth 
PSA.108.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
PSA.108.5	And thy glory above all the earth.
PSA.108.6	That thy beloved may be delivered,
PSA.108.6	Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
PSA.108.7	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will exult:
PSA.108.7	I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim also is the defence of mine head;
PSA.108.8	Judah is my sceptre.
PSA.108.9	Moab is my washpot;
PSA.108.9	Upon Edom will I cast my shoe:
PSA.108.9	Over Philistia will I shout.
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the fenced city?
PSA.108.10	Who hath led me unto Edom?
PSA.108.11	Hast not thou cast us off, O God?
PSA.108.11	And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
PSA.108.12	Give us help against the adversary:
PSA.108.12	For vain is the help of man.
PSA.108.13	Through God we shall do valiantly:
PSA.108.13	For he it is that shall tread down our adversaries.
PSA.109.1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
PSA.109.2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me:
PSA.109.2	They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred,
PSA.109.3	And fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	For my love they are my adversaries:
PSA.109.4	But I 
PSA.109.5	And they have rewarded me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	And hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set thou a wicked man over him:
PSA.109.6	And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him come forth guilty;
PSA.109.7	And let his prayer be turned into sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few;
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless,
PSA.109.9	And his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children be vagabonds, and beg;
PSA.109.10	And let them seek 
PSA.109.11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
PSA.109.11	And let strangers make spoil of his labour.
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him;
PSA.109.12	Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off;
PSA.109.13	In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the 
PSA.109.14	And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.15	That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
PSA.109.16	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy,
PSA.109.16	But persecuted the poor and needy man,
PSA.109.16	And the broken in heart, to slay 
PSA.109.17	Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him;
PSA.109.17	And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
PSA.109.18	He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment,
PSA.109.18	And it came into his inward parts like water,
PSA.109.18	And like oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,
PSA.109.19	And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
PSA.109.20	This is the reward of mine adversaries from the 
PSA.109.20	And of them that speak evil against my soul.
PSA.109.21	But deal thou with me, O 
PSA.109.21	Because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me,
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and needy,
PSA.109.22	And my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
PSA.109.23	I am tossed up and down as the locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting;
PSA.109.24	And my flesh faileth of fatness.
PSA.109.25	I am become also a reproach unto them:
PSA.109.25	When they see me, they shake their head.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.26	O save me according to thy mercy:
PSA.109.27	That they may know that this is thy hand;
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but bless thou:
PSA.109.28	When they arise, they shall be ashamed, but thy servant shall rejoice.
PSA.109.29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonour,
PSA.109.29	And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a mantle.
PSA.109.30	I will give great thanks unto the 
PSA.109.30	Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
PSA.109.31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the needy,
PSA.109.31	To save him from them that judge his soul.
PSA.110.1	The 
PSA.110.1	Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
PSA.110.2	The 
PSA.110.2	Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
PSA.110.3	Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power:
PSA.110.3	In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning,
PSA.110.3	Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
PSA.110.4	The 
PSA.110.4	Thou art a priest for ever
PSA.110.4	After the order of Melchizedek.
PSA.110.5	The Lord at thy right hand
PSA.110.5	Shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
PSA.110.6	He shall judge among the nations,
PSA.110.6	He shall fill 
PSA.110.6	He shall strike through the head in many countries.
PSA.110.7	He shall drink of the brook in the way:
PSA.110.7	Therefore shall he lift up the head.
PSA.111.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.111.1	I will give thanks unto the 
PSA.111.1	In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
PSA.111.2	The works of the 
PSA.111.2	Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
PSA.111.3	His work is honour and majesty:
PSA.111.3	And his righteousness endureth for ever.
PSA.111.4	He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:
PSA.111.4	The 
PSA.111.5	He hath given meat unto them that fear him:
PSA.111.5	He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
PSA.111.6	He hath shewed his people the power of his works,
PSA.111.6	In giving them the heritage of the nations.
PSA.111.7	The works of his hands are truth and judgement;
PSA.111.7	All his precepts are sure.
PSA.111.8	They are established for ever and ever,
PSA.111.8	They are done in truth and uprightness.
PSA.111.9	He hath sent redemption unto his people;
PSA.111.9	He hath commanded his covenant for ever:
PSA.111.9	Holy and reverend is his name.
PSA.111.10	The fear of the 
PSA.111.10	A good understanding have all they that do thereafter:
PSA.111.10	His praise endureth for ever.
PSA.112.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.112.1	Blessed is the man that feareth the 
PSA.112.1	That delighteth greatly in his commandments.
PSA.112.2	His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
PSA.112.2	The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches are in his house:
PSA.112.3	And his righteousness endureth for ever.
PSA.112.4	Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:
PSA.112.5	Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth;
PSA.112.5	He shall maintain his cause in judgement.
PSA.112.6	For he shall never be moved;
PSA.112.6	The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
PSA.112.7	He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
PSA.112.7	His heart is fixed, trusting in the 
PSA.112.8	His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
PSA.112.8	Until he see 
PSA.112.9	He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy;
PSA.112.9	His righteousness endureth for ever:
PSA.112.9	His horn shall be exalted with honour.
PSA.112.10	The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;
PSA.112.10	He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:
PSA.112.10	The desire of the wicked shall perish.
PSA.113.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.113.1	Praise, O ye servants of the 
PSA.113.1	Praise the name of the 
PSA.113.2	Blessed be the name of the 
PSA.113.2	From this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
PSA.113.3	The 
PSA.113.4	The 
PSA.113.4	And his glory above the heavens.
PSA.113.5	Who is like unto the 
PSA.113.5	That hath his seat on high,
PSA.113.6	That humbleth himself to behold
PSA.113.7	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
PSA.113.7	And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;
PSA.113.8	That he may set him with princes,
PSA.113.8	Even with the princes of his people.
PSA.113.9	He maketh the barren woman to keep house,
PSA.113.9	Praise ye the 
PSA.114.1	When Israel went forth out of Egypt,
PSA.114.1	The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
PSA.114.2	Judah became his sanctuary,
PSA.114.2	Israel his dominion.
PSA.114.3	The sea saw it, and fled;
PSA.114.3	Jordan was driven back.
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams,
PSA.114.4	The little hills like young sheep.
PSA.114.5	What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest?
PSA.114.5	Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?
PSA.114.6	Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams;
PSA.114.6	Ye little hills, like young sheep?
PSA.114.7	Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,
PSA.114.7	At the presence of the God of Jacob;
PSA.114.8	Which turned the rock into a pool of water,
PSA.114.8	The flint into a fountain of waters.
PSA.115.1	Not unto us, O 
PSA.115.1	But unto thy name give glory,
PSA.115.1	For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
PSA.115.2	Wherefore should the nations say,
PSA.115.2	Where is now their God?
PSA.115.3	But our God is in the heavens:
PSA.115.3	He hath done whatsoever he pleased.
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold,
PSA.115.4	The work of men's hands.
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but they speak not;
PSA.115.5	Eyes have they, but they see not;
PSA.115.6	They have ears, but they hear not;
PSA.115.6	Noses have they, but they smell not;
PSA.115.7	They have hands, but they handle not;
PSA.115.7	Feet have they, but they walk not;
PSA.115.7	Neither speak they through their throat.
PSA.115.8	They that make them shall be like unto them;
PSA.115.8	Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust thou in the 
PSA.115.9	He is their help and their shield.
PSA.115.10	O house of Aaron, trust ye in the 
PSA.115.10	He is their help and their shield.
PSA.115.11	Ye that fear the 
PSA.115.11	He is their help and their shield.
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Israel;
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Aaron.
PSA.115.13	He will bless them that fear the 
PSA.115.13	Both small and great.
PSA.115.14	The 
PSA.115.14	You and your children.
PSA.115.15	Blessed are ye of the 
PSA.115.15	Which made heaven and earth.
PSA.115.16	The heavens are the heavens of the 
PSA.115.16	But the earth hath he given to the children of men.
PSA.115.17	The dead praise not the 
PSA.115.17	Neither any that go down into silence;
PSA.115.18	But we will bless the 
PSA.115.18	From this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.115.18	Praise ye the 
PSA.116.1	I love the 
PSA.116.1	My voice and my supplications.
PSA.116.2	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,
PSA.116.2	Therefore will I call 
PSA.116.3	The cords of death compassed me,
PSA.116.3	And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me
PSA.116.3	I found trouble and sorrow
PSA.116.4	Then called I upon the name of the 
PSA.116.4	O 
PSA.116.5	Gracious is the 
PSA.116.5	Yea, our God is merciful.
PSA.116.6	The 
PSA.116.6	I was brought low, and he saved me.
PSA.116.7	Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
PSA.116.7	For the 
PSA.116.8	For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
PSA.116.8	Mine eyes from tears,
PSA.116.9	I will walk before the 
PSA.116.9	In the land of the living.
PSA.116.10	I believe, for I will speak:
PSA.116.10	I was greatly afflicted:
PSA.116.11	I said in my haste,
PSA.116.11	All men are a lie.
PSA.116.12	What shall I render unto the 
PSA.116.12	For all his benefits toward me?
PSA.116.13	I will take the cup of salvation,
PSA.116.13	And call upon the name of the 
PSA.116.14	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.14	Yea, in the presence of all his people.
PSA.116.15	Precious in the sight of the 
PSA.116.15	Is the death of his saints.
PSA.116.16	O 
PSA.116.16	I am thy servant, the son of thine handmaid;
PSA.116.16	Thou hast loosed my bonds.
PSA.116.17	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
PSA.116.17	And will call upon the name of the 
PSA.116.18	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.18	Yea, in the presence of all his people;
PSA.116.19	In the courts of the 
PSA.116.19	In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
PSA.116.19	Praise ye the 
PSA.117.1	O praise the 
PSA.117.1	Laud him, all ye peoples.
PSA.117.2	For his mercy is great toward us;
PSA.117.2	And the truth of the

PSA.121.2	Which made heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
PSA.121.3	He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he that keepeth Israel
PSA.121.4	Shall neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.6	The sun shall not smite thee by day,
PSA.121.6	Nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	He shall keep thy soul.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	From this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said unto me,
PSA.122.1	Let us go unto the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet are standing
PSA.122.2	Within thy gates, O Jerusalem;
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, that art builded
PSA.122.3	As a city that is compact together:
PSA.122.4	Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the 
PSA.122.4	To give thanks into the name of the 
PSA.122.5	For there are set thrones for judgement,
PSA.122.5	The thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
PSA.122.6	They shall prosper that love thee.
PSA.122.7	Peace be within thy walls,
PSA.122.7	And prosperity within thy palaces.
PSA.122.8	For my brethren and companions' sakes,
PSA.122.8	I will now say, Peace be within thee.
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will seek thy good.
PSA.123.1	Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes,
PSA.123.1	O thou that sittest in the heavens.
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of servants 
PSA.123.2	As the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress;
PSA.123.2	So our eyes 
PSA.123.3	Have mercy upon us, O 
PSA.123.3	For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
PSA.123.4	Our soul is exceedingly filled
PSA.123.4	With the scorning of those that are at ease,
PSA.123.4	And with the contempt of the proud.
PSA.124.1	If it had not been the 
PSA.124.1	Let Israel now say;
PSA.124.2	If it had not been the 
PSA.124.2	When men rose up against us:
PSA.124.3	Then they had swallowed us up alive,
PSA.124.3	When their wrath was kindled against us:
PSA.124.4	Then the waters had overwhelmed us,
PSA.124.4	The stream had gone over our soul:
PSA.124.5	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
PSA.124.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.124.6	Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
PSA.124.7	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
PSA.124.7	The snare is broken, and we are escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of the 
PSA.124.8	Who made heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	They that trust in the 
PSA.125.1	Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.
PSA.125.2	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	So the 
PSA.125.2	From this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.125.3	For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;
PSA.125.3	That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.
PSA.125.4	Do good, O 
PSA.125.4	And to them that are upright in their hearts.
PSA.125.5	But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways,
PSA.125.5	The 
PSA.125.5	Peace be upon Israel.
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	We were like unto them that dream.
PSA.126.2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	And our tongue with singing:
PSA.126.2	Then said they among the nations,
PSA.126.2	The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.4	Turn again our captivity, O 
PSA.126.4	As the streams in the South.
PSA.126.5	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
PSA.126.6	Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing forth the seed;
PSA.126.6	He shall come again with joy, bringing his sheaves 
PSA.127.1	Except the 
PSA.127.1	They labour in vain that build it:
PSA.127.1	Except the 
PSA.127.1	The watchman waketh but in vain.
PSA.127.2	It is vain for you that ye rise up early, and so late take rest,
PSA.127.2	And eat the bread of toil:
PSA.127.3	Lo, children are an heritage of the 
PSA.127.4	As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
PSA.127.4	So are the children of youth.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:
PSA.127.5	They shall not be ashamed,
PSA.127.5	When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
PSA.128.1	Blessed is every one that feareth the 
PSA.128.1	That walketh in his ways.
PSA.128.2	For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands:
PSA.128.2	Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
PSA.128.3	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thine house:
PSA.128.3	Thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.
PSA.128.4	Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed
PSA.128.4	That feareth the 
PSA.128.5	The 
PSA.128.5	And thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
PSA.128.6	Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children.
PSA.128.6	Peace be upon Israel.
PSA.129.1	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up,
PSA.129.1	Let Israel now say;
PSA.129.2	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up:
PSA.129.2	Yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	The plowers plowed upon my back;
PSA.129.3	They made long their furrows.
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.4	He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
PSA.129.5	Let them be ashamed and turned backward,
PSA.129.5	All they that hate Zion.
PSA.129.6	Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
PSA.129.6	Which withereth afore it groweth up:
PSA.129.7	Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand,
PSA.129.7	Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
PSA.129.8	Neither do they which go by say,
PSA.129.8	The blessing of the 
PSA.129.8	We bless you in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice:
PSA.130.2	Let thine ears be attentive
PSA.130.2	To the voice of my supplications.
PSA.130.3	If thou, 
PSA.130.3	O Lord, who shall stand?
PSA.130.4	But there is forgiveness with thee,
PSA.130.4	That thou mayest be feared.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.5	And in his word do I hope.
PSA.130.6	My soul 
PSA.130.6	More than watchmen 
PSA.130.7	O Israel, hope in the 
PSA.130.7	For with the 
PSA.130.7	And with him is plenteous redemption
PSA.130.8	And he shall redeem Israel
PSA.130.8	From all his iniquities.
PSA.131.1	Neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
PSA.131.1	Or in things too wonderful for me.
PSA.131.2	Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;
PSA.131.2	Like a weaned child with his mother,
PSA.131.2	My soul is with me like a weaned child.
PSA.131.3	O Israel, hope in the 
PSA.131.3	From this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.132.1	All his affliction;
PSA.132.2	How he sware unto the 
PSA.132.2	And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
PSA.132.3	Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
PSA.132.3	Nor go up into my bed;
PSA.132.4	I will not give sleep to mine eyes,
PSA.132.4	Or slumber to mine eyelids;
PSA.132.5	Until I find out a place for the 
PSA.132.5	A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
PSA.132.6	Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah:
PSA.132.6	We found it in the field of the wood.
PSA.132.7	We will go into his tabernacles;
PSA.132.7	We will worship at his footstool.
PSA.132.8	Arise, O 
PSA.132.8	Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
PSA.132.9	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
PSA.132.9	And let thy saints shout for joy.
PSA.132.10	For thy servant David's sake
PSA.132.10	Turn not away the face of thine anointed.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.11	He will not turn from it:
PSA.132.11	Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
PSA.132.12	If thy children will keep my covenant
PSA.132.12	And my testimony that I shall teach them,
PSA.132.12	Their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.13	He hath desired it for his habitation.
PSA.132.14	This is my resting place for ever:
PSA.132.14	Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless her provision:
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy her poor with bread.
PSA.132.16	Her priests also will I clothe with salvation:
PSA.132.16	And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
PSA.132.17	There will I make the horn of David to bud:
PSA.132.17	I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
PSA.132.18	His enemies will I clothe with shame:
PSA.132.18	But upon himself shall his crown flourish.
PSA.133.1	Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	For brethren to dwell together in unity!
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious oil upon the head,
PSA.133.2	That ran down upon the beard,
PSA.133.2	Even Aaron's beard;
PSA.133.2	That came down upon the skirt of his garments;
PSA.133.3	Like the dew of Hermon,
PSA.133.3	That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion:
PSA.133.3	For there the 
PSA.133.3	Even life for evermore.
PSA.134.1	Behold, bless ye the 
PSA.134.1	Which by night stand in the house of the 
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands to the sanctuary,
PSA.134.2	And bless ye the 
PSA.134.3	The 
PSA.134.3	Even he that made heaven and earth.
PSA.135.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.135.1	Praise ye the name of the 
PSA.135.1	Praise 
PSA.135.2	Ye that stand in the house of the 
PSA.135.2	In the courts of the house of our God.
PSA.135.3	Praise ye the 
PSA.135.3	Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
PSA.135.4	For the 
PSA.135.5	For I know that the 
PSA.135.5	And that our Lord is above all gods.
PSA.135.6	Whatsoever the 
PSA.135.6	In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.
PSA.135.7	He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
PSA.135.7	He maketh lightnings for the rain;
PSA.135.7	He bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.
PSA.135.8	Who smote the firstborn of Egypt,
PSA.135.8	Both of man and beast.
PSA.135.9	He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
PSA.135.9	Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
PSA.135.10	Who smote many nations,
PSA.135.10	And slew mighty kings;
PSA.135.11	Sihon king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	And Og king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	And all the kingdoms of Canaan:
PSA.135.12	And gave their land for an heritage,
PSA.135.12	An heritage unto Israel his people.
PSA.135.13	Thy name, O 
PSA.135.13	Thy memorial, O 
PSA.135.14	For the 
PSA.135.14	And repent himself concerning his servants.
PSA.135.15	The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
PSA.135.15	The work of men's hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but they speak not;
PSA.135.16	Eyes have they, but they see not;
PSA.135.17	They have ears, but they hear not;
PSA.135.17	Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	They that make them shall be like unto them;
PSA.135.18	Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
PSA.135.19	O house of Israel, bless ye the 
PSA.135.19	O house of Aaron, bless ye the 
PSA.135.20	O house of Levi, bless ye the 
PSA.135.20	Ye that fear the 
PSA.135.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.135.21	Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
PSA.135.21	Praise ye the 
PSA.136.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.136.1	For his mercy 
PSA.136.2	O give thanks unto the God of gods:
PSA.136.2	For his mercy 
PSA.136.3	O give thanks unto the Lord of lords:
PSA.136.3	For his mercy 
PSA.136.4	To him who alone doeth great wonders:
PSA.136.4	For his mercy 
PSA.136.5	To him that by understanding made the heavens:
PSA.136.5	For his mercy 
PSA.136.6	To him that spread forth the earth above the waters:
PSA.136.6	For his mercy 
PSA.136.7	To him that made great lights:
PSA.136.7	For his mercy 
PSA.136.8	The sun to rule by day:
PSA.136.8	For his mercy 
PSA.136.9	The moon and stars to rule by night:
PSA.136.9	For his mercy 
PSA.136.10	To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn:
PSA.136.10	For his mercy 
PSA.136.11	And brought out Israel from among them:
PSA.136.11	For his mercy 
PSA.136.12	With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm:
PSA.136.12	For his mercy 
PSA.136.13	To him which divided the Red Sea in sunder:
PSA.136.13	For his mercy 
PSA.136.14	And made Israel to pass through the midst of it:
PSA.136.14	For his mercy 
PSA.136.15	But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea:
PSA.136.15	For his mercy 
PSA.136.16	To him which led his people through the wilderness:
PSA.136.16	For his mercy 
PSA.136.17	To him which smote great kings:
PSA.136.17	For his mercy 
PSA.136.18	And slew famous kings:
PSA.136.18	For his mercy 
PSA.136.19	Sihon king of the Amorites:
PSA.136.19	For his mercy 
PSA.136.20	And Og king of Bashan:
PSA.136.20	For his mercy 
PSA.136.21	And gave their land for an heritage:
PSA.136.21	For his mercy 
PSA.136.22	Even an heritage unto Israel his servant:
PSA.136.22	For his mercy 
PSA.136.23	Who remembered us in our low estate:
PSA.136.23	For his mercy 
PSA.136.24	And hath delivered us from our adversaries:
PSA.136.24	For his mercy 
PSA.136.25	He giveth food to all flesh:
PSA.136.25	For his mercy 
PSA.136.26	O give thanks unto the God of heaven:
PSA.136.26	For his mercy 
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon,
PSA.137.1	There we sat down, yea, we wept,
PSA.137.1	When we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	Upon the willows in the midst thereof
PSA.137.2	We hanged up our harps
PSA.137.3	For there they that led us captive required of us songs,
PSA.137.3	And they that wasted us 
PSA.137.3	Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
PSA.137.4	How shall we sing the 
PSA.137.4	In a strange land?
PSA.137.5	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	Let my right hand forget 
PSA.137.6	Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
PSA.137.6	If I remember thee not;
PSA.137.6	If I prefer not Jerusalem
PSA.137.6	Above my chief joy.
PSA.137.7	Remember, O 
PSA.137.7	The day of Jerusalem;
PSA.137.7	Who said, Rase it, rase it,
PSA.137.7	Even to the foundation thereof.
PSA.137.8	O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed;
PSA.137.8	Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee
PSA.137.8	As thou hast served us.
PSA.137.9	Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
PSA.137.9	Against the rock.
PSA.138.1	I will give thee thanks with my whole heart:
PSA.138.1	Before the gods will I sing praises unto thee.
PSA.138.2	I will worship toward thy holy temple,
PSA.138.2	And give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth:
PSA.138.2	For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
PSA.138.3	In the day that I called thou answeredst me,
PSA.138.3	Thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O 
PSA.138.4	For they have heard the words of thy mouth.
PSA.138.5	Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the 
PSA.138.5	For great is the glory of the 
PSA.138.6	For though the 
PSA.138.6	But the haughty he knoweth from afar.
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me;
PSA.138.7	Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies,
PSA.138.7	And thy right hand shall save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.138.8	Thy mercy, O 
PSA.138.8	Forsake not the works of thine own hands.
PSA.139.2	Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,
PSA.139.2	Thou understandest my thought afar off.
PSA.139.3	Thou searchest out my path and my lying down,
PSA.139.3	And art acquainted with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	For there is not a word in my tongue,
PSA.139.4	But, lo, O 
PSA.139.5	Thou hast beset me behind and before,
PSA.139.5	And laid thine hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
PSA.139.7	Whither shall I from thy spirit?
PSA.139.7	Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
PSA.139.8	If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the morning,
PSA.139.9	And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
PSA.139.10	Even there shall thy hand lead me,
PSA.139.10	And thy right hand shall hold me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me,
PSA.139.11	And the light about me shall be night;
PSA.139.12	Even the darkness hideth not from thee,
PSA.139.12	But the night shineth as the day:
PSA.139.12	The darkness and the light are both alike 
PSA.139.13	For thou hast possessed my reins:
PSA.139.13	Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
PSA.139.14	I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
PSA.139.14	Wonderful are thy works;
PSA.139.14	And that my soul knoweth right well.
PSA.139.15	My frame was not hidden from thee,
PSA.139.15	When I was made in secret,
PSA.139.15	And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Thine eyes did see mine unperfect substance,
PSA.139.16	And in thy book were all 
PSA.139.16	Which day by day were fashioned,
PSA.139.16	When as yet there was none of them.
PSA.139.17	How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!
PSA.139.17	How great is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
PSA.139.18	When I awake, I am still with thee.
PSA.139.19	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:
PSA.139.19	Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
PSA.139.20	For they speak against thee wickedly,
PSA.139.20	And thine enemies take 
PSA.139.21	Do not I hate them, O 
PSA.139.21	And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
PSA.139.22	I hate them with perfect hatred:
PSA.139.22	I count them mine enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart:
PSA.139.23	Try me and know my thoughts:
PSA.139.24	And see if there be any way of wickedness in me,
PSA.139.24	And lead me in the way everlasting.
PSA.140.1	Deliver me, O 
PSA.140.1	Preserve me from the violent man:
PSA.140.2	Which imagine mischiefs in their heart;
PSA.140.2	Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
PSA.140.3	They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;
PSA.140.3	Adders' poison is under their lips. 
PSA.140.4	Keep me, O 
PSA.140.4	Preserve me from the violent man:
PSA.140.4	Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
PSA.140.5	The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;
PSA.140.5	They have spread a net by the way side;
PSA.140.5	They have set gins for me. 
PSA.140.6	I said unto the 
PSA.140.6	Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O 
PSA.140.7	O 
PSA.140.7	Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	Grant not, O 
PSA.140.8	Further not his evil device; 
PSA.140.9	As for the head of those that compass me about,
PSA.140.9	Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall upon them:
PSA.140.10	Let them be cast into the fire;
PSA.140.10	Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
PSA.140.11	An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth:
PSA.140.11	Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
PSA.140.12	I know that the 
PSA.140.12	And the right of the needy.
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:
PSA.140.13	The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
PSA.141.1	Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee;
PSA.141.2	The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Set a watch, O 
PSA.141.3	Keep the door of my lips.
PSA.141.4	Incline not my heart to any evil thing,
PSA.141.4	To be occupied in deeds of wickedness
PSA.141.4	With men that work iniquity:
PSA.141.4	And let me not eat of their dainties.
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous smite me, 
PSA.141.5	And let him reprove me, 
PSA.141.5	Let not my head refuse it:
PSA.141.5	For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
PSA.141.6	Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock;
PSA.141.6	And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
PSA.141.7	As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth,
PSA.141.7	Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth.
PSA.141.8	For mine eyes are unto thee, O 
PSA.141.8	In thee do I put my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
PSA.141.9	And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
PSA.141.10	Whilst that I withal escape.
PSA.142.1	I cry with my voice unto the 
PSA.142.1	With my voice unto the 
PSA.142.2	I pour out my complaint before him;
PSA.142.2	I shew before him my trouble.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, thou knewest my path.
PSA.142.3	In the way wherein I walk have they hidden a snare for me.
PSA.142.4	Look on 
PSA.142.4	Refuge hath failed me; no man careth for my soul.
PSA.142.5	I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.142.5	I said, Thou art my refuge,
PSA.142.5	My portion in the land of the living.
PSA.142.6	Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low:
PSA.142.6	Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
PSA.142.7	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy name:
PSA.142.7	The righteous shall compass me about;
PSA.142.7	for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
PSA.143.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.143.1	In thy faithfulness answer me, 
PSA.143.2	And enter not into judgement with thy servant;
PSA.143.2	For in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
PSA.143.3	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
PSA.143.3	He hath smitten my life down to the ground:
PSA.143.3	He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
PSA.143.4	Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
PSA.143.4	My heart within me is desolate.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old;
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all thy doings:
PSA.143.5	I muse on the work of thy hands.
PSA.143.6	I spread forth my hands unto thee:
PSA.143.6	My soul 
PSA.143.7	Make haste to answer me, O 
PSA.143.7	Hide not thy face from me;
PSA.143.7	Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
PSA.143.8	Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning;
PSA.143.8	For in thee do I trust:
PSA.143.8	Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
PSA.143.8	For I lift up my soul unto thee.
PSA.143.9	Deliver me, O 
PSA.143.9	I flee unto thee to hide me.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God:
PSA.143.10	Thy spirit is good; lead me in the land of uprightness.
PSA.143.11	Quicken me, O 
PSA.143.11	In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
PSA.143.12	And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies,
PSA.143.12	And destroy all them that afflict my soul;
PSA.143.12	For I am thy servant.
PSA.144.1	Blessed be the 
PSA.144.1	Which teacheth my hands to war,
PSA.144.2	My lovingkindness, and my fortress,
PSA.144.2	My high tower, and my deliverer;
PSA.144.2	My shield, and he in whom I trust;
PSA.144.2	Who subdueth my people under me.
PSA.144.3	Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
PSA.144.4	Man is like to vanity:
PSA.144.4	His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
PSA.144.5	Bow thy heavens, O 
PSA.144.5	Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
PSA.144.6	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
PSA.144.6	Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
PSA.144.7	Stretch forth thine hand from above;
PSA.144.7	Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,
PSA.144.7	Out of the hand of strangers;
PSA.144.8	Whose mouth speaketh vanity,
PSA.144.8	And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song unto thee, O God:
PSA.144.9	Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
PSA.144.10	It is he that giveth salvation unto kings:
PSA.144.10	Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
PSA.144.11	Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers,
PSA.144.11	Whose mouth speaketh vanity,
PSA.144.11	And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.12	When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth;
PSA.144.12	And our daughters as corner stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
PSA.144.14	And no outcry in our streets;
PSA.144.15	Happy is the people, that is in such a case:
PSA.145.1	I will extol thee, my God, O King;
PSA.145.1	And I will bless thy name for ever and ever
PSA.145.2	Every day will I bless thee;
PSA.145.2	And I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
PSA.145.3	Great is the 
PSA.145.3	And his greatness is unsearchable.
PSA.145.4	One generation shall laud thy works to another,
PSA.145.4	And shall declare thy mighty acts.
PSA.145.5	Of the glorious majesty of thine honour,
PSA.145.5	And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate.
PSA.145.6	And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts;
PSA.145.6	And I will declare thy greatness.
PSA.145.7	They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness,
PSA.145.7	And shall sing of thy righteousness.
PSA.145.8	The 
PSA.145.8	Slow to anger, and of great mercy.
PSA.145.9	The 
PSA.145.9	And his tender mercies are over all his works.
PSA.145.10	All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O 
PSA.145.10	And thy saints shall bless thee.
PSA.145.11	They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,
PSA.145.11	And talk of thy power;
PSA.145.12	To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts,
PSA.145.12	And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
PSA.145.13	Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
PSA.145.13	And thy dominion 
PSA.145.14	The 
PSA.145.14	And raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
PSA.145.15	The eyes of all wait upon thee;
PSA.145.15	And thou givest them their meat in due season.
PSA.145.16	Thou openest thine hand,
PSA.145.16	And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
PSA.145.17	The 
PSA.145.17	And gracious in all his works.
PSA.145.18	The 
PSA.145.18	To all that call upon him in truth.
PSA.145.19	He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him;
PSA.145.19	He also will hear their cry, and will save them
PSA.145.20	The 
PSA.145.20	But all the wicked will he destroy.
PSA.145.21	My mouth shall speak the praise of the 
PSA.145.21	And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
PSA.146.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.146.1	Praise the 
PSA.146.2	While I live will I praise the 
PSA.146.2	I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
PSA.146.3	Put not your trust in princes,
PSA.146.3	Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
PSA.146.4	His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth;
PSA.146.4	In that very day his thoughts perish.
PSA.146.5	Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,
PSA.146.5	Whose hope is in the 
PSA.146.6	Which made heaven and earth, the sea,
PSA.146.6	And all that in them is;

PSA.147.14	He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
PSA.147.15	He sendeth out his commandment upon earth;
PSA.147.15	His word runneth very swiftly.
PSA.147.16	He giveth snow like wool;
PSA.147.16	He scattereth the hoar frost like ashes.
PSA.147.17	He casteth forth his ice like morsels:
PSA.147.17	Who can stand before his cold?
PSA.147.18	He sendeth out his word, and melteth them:
PSA.147.18	He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
PSA.147.19	He sheweth his word unto Jacob,
PSA.147.19	His statutes and his judgements unto Israel.
PSA.147.20	He hath not dealt so with any nation:

PSA.150.5	Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
PSA.150.6	Let every thing that hath breath praise the 
PSA.150.6	Praise ye the 
PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
PRO.1.2	To know wisdom and instruction;
PRO.1.2	to discern the words of understanding;
PRO.1.3	To receive instruction in wise dealing,
PRO.1.3	In righteousness and judgement and equity;
PRO.1.4	To give subtilty to the simple,
PRO.1.4	To the young man knowledge and discretion:
PRO.1.5	That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
PRO.1.5	And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:
PRO.1.6	To understand a proverb, and a figure;
PRO.1.6	The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.8	My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
PRO.1.8	And forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.1.9	For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head,
PRO.1.9	And chains about thy neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice thee,
PRO.1.10	Consent thou not.
PRO.1.11	If they say, Come with us,
PRO.1.11	Let us lay wait for blood,
PRO.1.11	Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;
PRO.1.12	Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol,
PRO.1.12	And whole, as those that go down into the pit;
PRO.1.13	We shall find all precious substance,
PRO.1.13	We shall fill our houses with spoil;
PRO.1.14	Thou shalt cast thy lot among us;
PRO.1.14	We will all have one purse:
PRO.1.15	My son, walk not thou in the way with them;
PRO.1.15	Refrain thy foot from their path:
PRO.1.16	For their feet run to evil,
PRO.1.16	And they make haste to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	For in vain is the net spread, in the eyes of any bird:
PRO.1.18	And these lay wait for their own blood,
PRO.1.18	They lurk privily for their own lives.
PRO.1.19	So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
PRO.1.19	It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom crieth aloud in the street;
PRO.1.20	She uttereth her voice in the broad places;
PRO.1.21	She crieth in the chief place of concourse;
PRO.1.21	At the entering in of the gates,
PRO.1.21	In the city, she uttereth her words:
PRO.1.22	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?
PRO.1.22	And scorners delight them in scorning,
PRO.1.22	And fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Turn you at my reproof:
PRO.1.23	Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,
PRO.1.23	I will make known my words unto you.
PRO.1.24	Because I have called, and ye refused;
PRO.1.24	I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
PRO.1.25	But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
PRO.1.25	And would none of my reproof:
PRO.1.26	I also will laugh in 
PRO.1.26	I will mock when your fear cometh;
PRO.1.27	When your fear cometh as a storm,
PRO.1.27	And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;
PRO.1.27	When distress and anguish come upon you.
PRO.1.28	Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer;
PRO.1.28	They shall seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:
PRO.1.29	For that they hated knowledge,
PRO.1.29	And did not choose the fear of the 
PRO.1.30	They would none of my counsel;
PRO.1.30	They despised all my reproof:
PRO.1.31	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
PRO.1.31	And be filled with their own devices.
PRO.1.32	For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them,
PRO.1.32	And the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely,
PRO.1.33	And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
PRO.2.1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
PRO.2.1	And lay up my commandments with thee;
PRO.2.2	So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
PRO.2.2	And apply thine heart to understanding;
PRO.2.3	Yea, if thou cry after discernment,
PRO.2.3	And lift up thy voice for understanding;
PRO.2.4	If thou seek her as silver,
PRO.2.4	And search for her as for hid treasures;
PRO.2.5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the 
PRO.2.5	And find the knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.6	Out of his mouth 
PRO.2.7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright,
PRO.2.8	That he may guard the paths of judgement,
PRO.2.8	And preserve the way of his saints.
PRO.2.9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgement,
PRO.2.9	And equity, 
PRO.2.10	For wisdom shall enter into thine heart,
PRO.2.10	And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
PRO.2.11	Discretion shall watch over thee,
PRO.2.11	Understanding shall keep thee:
PRO.2.12	To deliver thee from the way of evil,
PRO.2.12	From the men that speak froward things;
PRO.2.13	Who forsake the paths of uprightness,
PRO.2.13	To walk in the ways of darkness;
PRO.2.14	Who rejoice to do evil,
PRO.2.14	And delight in the frowardness of evil;
PRO.2.15	Who are crooked in their ways,
PRO.2.15	And perverse in their paths:
PRO.2.16	To deliver thee from the strange woman,
PRO.2.16	Even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
PRO.2.17	Which forsaketh the friend of her youth,
PRO.2.17	And forgetteth the covenant of her God:
PRO.2.18	For her house inclineth unto death,
PRO.2.18	And her paths unto the dead:
PRO.2.19	None that go unto her return again,
PRO.2.19	Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:
PRO.2.20	That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
PRO.2.20	And keep the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright shall dwell in the land,
PRO.2.21	And the perfect shall remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,
PRO.2.22	And they that deal treacherously shall be rooted out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, forget not my law;
PRO.3.1	but let thine heart keep my commandments:
PRO.3.2	For length of days, and years of life,
PRO.3.2	And peace, shall they add to thee.
PRO.3.3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee:
PRO.3.3	Bind them about thy neck;
PRO.3.3	Write them upon the table of thine heart:
PRO.3.4	So shalt thou find favour and good understanding
PRO.3.4	In the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	And lean not upon thine own understanding:
PRO.3.6	In all thy ways acknowledge him,
PRO.3.6	And he shall direct thy paths.
PRO.3.7	Be not wise in thine own eyes;
PRO.3.7	Fear the 
PRO.3.8	It shall be health to thy navel,
PRO.3.8	And marrow to thy bones.
PRO.3.9	Honour the 
PRO.3.9	And with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
PRO.3.10	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
PRO.3.10	And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, despise not the chastening of the 
PRO.3.11	Neither be weary of his reproof:
PRO.3.12	For whom the 
PRO.3.12	Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
PRO.3.13	Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
PRO.3.13	And the man that getteth understanding.
PRO.3.14	For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
PRO.3.14	And the gain thereof than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than rubies:
PRO.3.15	And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.
PRO.3.16	Length of days is in her right had;
PRO.3.16	In her left hand are riches and honour.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
PRO.3.17	And all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:
PRO.3.18	And happy is every one that retaineth her.
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.19	By understanding he established the heavens.
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge the depths were broken up,
PRO.3.20	And the skies drop down the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, let not them depart from thine eyes;
PRO.3.21	Keep sound wisdom and discretion;
PRO.3.22	So shall they be life unto thy soul,
PRO.3.22	And grace to thy neck.
PRO.3.23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely,
PRO.3.23	And thy foot shall not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
PRO.3.24	Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Be not afraid of sudden fear,
PRO.3.25	Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:
PRO.3.26	For the 
PRO.3.26	And shall keep thy foot from being taken.
PRO.3.27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
PRO.3.27	When it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
PRO.3.28	Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again,
PRO.3.28	And tomorrow I will give;
PRO.3.28	When thou hast it by thee.
PRO.3.29	Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
PRO.3.29	Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
PRO.3.30	Strive not with a man without cause,
PRO.3.30	If he have done thee no harm.
PRO.3.31	Envy thou not the man of violence,
PRO.3.31	And choose none of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the perverse is an abomination to the 
PRO.3.32	But his secret is with the upright.
PRO.3.33	The curse of the 
PRO.3.33	But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
PRO.3.34	Surely he scorneth the scorners,
PRO.3.34	But he giveth grace unto the lowly.
PRO.3.35	The wise shall inherit glory;
PRO.3.35	But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
PRO.4.1	Hear, 
PRO.4.1	And attend to know understanding:
PRO.4.2	For I give you good doctrine;
PRO.4.2	Forsake ye not my law.
PRO.4.3	For I was a son unto my father,
PRO.4.3	Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
PRO.4.4	And he taught me, and said unto me,
PRO.4.4	Let thine heart retain my words;
PRO.4.4	Keep my commandments, and live:
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding;
PRO.4.5	Forget 
PRO.4.6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee;
PRO.4.6	Love her, and she shall keep thee.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom 
PRO.4.7	Yea, with all thou hast gotten get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:
PRO.4.8	She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She shall give to thine head a chaplet of grace:
PRO.4.9	A crown of beauty shall she deliver to thee.
PRO.4.10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
PRO.4.10	And the years of thy life shall be many.
PRO.4.11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
PRO.4.11	I have led thee in paths of uprightness.
PRO.4.12	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
PRO.4.12	And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
PRO.4.13	Keep her; for she is thy life.
PRO.4.14	Enter not into the path of the wicked,
PRO.4.14	And walk not in the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, pass not by it;
PRO.4.15	Turn from it, and pass on.
PRO.4.16	For they sleep not, except they have done mischief;
PRO.4.16	And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness,
PRO.4.17	And drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the righteous is as the shining light,
PRO.4.18	That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is as darkness:
PRO.4.19	They know not at what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, attend to my words;
PRO.4.20	Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Let them not depart from thine eyes;
PRO.4.21	Keep them in the midst of thine heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life unto those that find them,
PRO.4.22	And health to all their flesh.
PRO.4.23	Keep thy heart with all diligence;
PRO.4.23	For out of it are the issues of life.
PRO.4.24	Put away from thee a froward mouth,
PRO.4.24	And perverse lips put far from thee.
PRO.4.25	Let thine eyes look right on,
PRO.4.25	And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
PRO.4.26	Make level the path of thy feet,
PRO.4.26	And let all thy ways be established.
PRO.4.27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
PRO.4.27	Remove thy foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, attend unto my wisdom;
PRO.5.1	Incline thine ear to my understanding:
PRO.5.2	That thou mayest preserve discretion,
PRO.5.2	And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,
PRO.5.3	And her mouth is smoother than oil:
PRO.5.4	But her latter end is bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	Sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	Her steps take hold on Sheol;
PRO.5.6	So that she findeth not the level path of life:
PRO.5.6	Her ways are unstable 
PRO.5.7	Now therefore, 
PRO.5.7	And depart not from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Remove thy way far from her,
PRO.5.8	And come not nigh the door of her house:
PRO.5.9	Lest thou give thine honour unto others,
PRO.5.9	And thy years unto the cruel:
PRO.5.10	Lest strangers be filled with thy strength;
PRO.5.10	And thy labours 
PRO.5.11	And thou mourn at thy latter end,
PRO.5.11	When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
PRO.5.12	And say, How have I hated instruction,
PRO.5.12	And my heart despised reproof;
PRO.5.13	Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,
PRO.5.13	Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I was well nigh in all evil
PRO.5.14	In the midst of the congregation and assembly.
PRO.5.15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
PRO.5.15	And running waters out of thine own well.
PRO.5.16	Should thy springs be dispersed abroad,
PRO.5.16	And rivers of water in the streets?
PRO.5.17	Let them be for thyself alone,
PRO.5.17	And not for strangers with thee.
PRO.5.18	Let thy fountain be blessed;
PRO.5.18	And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
PRO.5.19	Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
PRO.5.19	And be thou ravished always with her love.
PRO.5.20	For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
PRO.5.20	And embrace the bosom of a stranger?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the 
PRO.5.21	And he maketh level all his paths.
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked,
PRO.5.22	And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
PRO.5.23	He shall die for lack of instruction;
PRO.5.23	And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour,
PRO.6.1	If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger,
PRO.6.2	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
PRO.6.2	Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
PRO.6.3	Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour;
PRO.6.3	Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbour.
PRO.6.4	Give not sleep to thine eyes,
PRO.6.4	Nor slumber to thine eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand 
PRO.6.5	And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
PRO.6.6	Consider her ways, and be wise:
PRO.6.7	Which having no chief,
PRO.6.7	Overseer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	Provideth her meat in the summer,
PRO.6.8	And gathereth her food in the harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
PRO.6.10	A little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.6.11	So shall thy poverty come as a robber,
PRO.6.11	And thy want as an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A worthless person, a man of iniquity;
PRO.6.12	He walketh with a froward mouth;
PRO.6.13	He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet,
PRO.6.13	He maketh signs with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually;
PRO.6.14	He soweth discord.
PRO.6.15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
PRO.6.15	On a sudden shall he be broken and that without remedy.
PRO.6.16	There be six things which the 
PRO.6.16	Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:
PRO.6.17	Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	And hands that shed innocent blood;
PRO.6.18	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
PRO.6.18	Feet that be swift in running to mischief;
PRO.6.19	A false witness that uttereth lies,
PRO.6.19	And he that soweth discord among brethren.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep the commandment of thy father,
PRO.6.20	And forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually upon thine heart,
PRO.6.21	Tie them about thy neck.
PRO.6.22	When thou walkest, it shall lead thee;
PRO.6.22	When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee;
PRO.6.22	And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light;
PRO.6.23	And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
PRO.6.24	To keep thee from the evil woman,
PRO.6.24	From the flattery of the stranger's tongue.
PRO.6.25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart;
PRO.6.25	Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
PRO.6.26	For on account of a whorish woman 
PRO.6.26	And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire in his bosom,
PRO.6.27	And his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Or can one walk upon hot coals,
PRO.6.28	And his feet not be scorched?
PRO.6.29	So he that goeth in to his nieghbour's wife;
PRO.6.29	Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.
PRO.6.30	Men do not despise a thief, if he steal
PRO.6.30	To satisfy his soul when he is hungry:
PRO.6.31	But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;
PRO.6.31	He shall give all the substance of his house.
PRO.6.32	He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding:
PRO.6.32	He doeth it that would destroy his own soul.
PRO.6.33	Wounds and dishonour shall he get;
PRO.6.33	And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy is the rage of a man;
PRO.6.34	And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will not regard any ransom;
PRO.6.35	Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words,
PRO.7.1	And lay up my commandments with thee.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments and live;
PRO.7.2	And my law as the apple of thine eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them upon thy fingers;
PRO.7.3	Write them upon the table of thine heart.
PRO.7.4	Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister;
PRO.7.4	And call understanding 
PRO.7.5	That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
PRO.7.5	From the stranger which flattereth with her words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked forth through my lattice;
PRO.7.7	And I beheld among the simple ones,
PRO.7.7	I discerned among the youths,
PRO.7.7	A young man void of understanding,
PRO.7.8	Passing through the street near her corner,
PRO.7.8	And he went the way to her house;
PRO.7.9	In the twilight, in the evening of the day,
PRO.7.9	In the blackness of night and the darkness.
PRO.7.10	And, behold, there met him a woman
PRO.7.10	With the attire of an harlot, and wily of heart.
PRO.7.11	She is clamorous, and wilful;
PRO.7.11	Her feet abide not in her house:
PRO.7.12	Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places,
PRO.7.12	And lieth in wait at every corner.
PRO.7.13	So she caught him, and kissed him,
PRO.7.14	Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me;
PRO.7.14	This day have I paid my vows.
PRO.7.15	Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
PRO.7.15	Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
PRO.7.16	I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,
PRO.7.16	With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;
PRO.7.18	Let us solace ourselves with loves.
PRO.7.19	For the goodman is not at home,
PRO.7.19	He is gone a long journey:
PRO.7.20	He hath taken a bag of money with him;
PRO.7.20	He will come home at the full moon.
PRO.7.21	With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield,
PRO.7.21	With the flattering of her lips she forceth him away.
PRO.7.22	He goeth after her straightway,
PRO.7.22	As an ox goeth to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	Or as fetters to the correction of the fool;
PRO.7.23	Till an arrow strike through his liver;
PRO.7.23	As a bird hasteth to the snare,
PRO.7.23	And knoweth not that it is for his life.
PRO.7.24	Now therefore, 
PRO.7.24	And attend to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Let not thine heart decline to her ways,
PRO.7.25	Go not astray in her paths.
PRO.7.26	For she hath cast down many wounded:
PRO.7.26	Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to Sheol,
PRO.7.27	Going down to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Doth not wisdom cry,
PRO.8.1	And understanding put forth her voice?
PRO.8.2	In the top of high places by the way,
PRO.8.2	Where the paths meet, she standeth;
PRO.8.3	Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
PRO.8.3	At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
PRO.8.4	Unto you, O men, I call;
PRO.8.4	And my voice is to the sons of men.
PRO.8.5	O ye simple, understand subtilty;
PRO.8.5	And, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
PRO.8.6	Hear, for I will speak excellent things;
PRO.8.6	And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
PRO.8.7	For my mouth shall utter truth;
PRO.8.7	And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;
PRO.8.8	There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all plain to him that understandeth,
PRO.8.9	And right to them that find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Receive my instruction, and not silver;
PRO.8.10	And knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than rubies;
PRO.8.11	And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto her.
PRO.8.12	I wisdom have made subtilty my dwelling,
PRO.8.12	And find out knowledge 
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.13	Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,
PRO.8.13	And the froward mouth, do I hate.
PRO.8.14	Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge:
PRO.8.14	I am understanding; I have might.
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign,
PRO.8.15	And princes decree justice.
PRO.8.16	By me princes rule,
PRO.8.16	And nobles, 
PRO.8.17	I love them that love me;
PRO.8.17	And those that seek me diligently shall find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honour are with me;
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
PRO.8.19	And my revenue than choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I walk in the way of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	In the midst of the paths of judgement:
PRO.8.21	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance,
PRO.8.21	And that I may fill their treasuries.
PRO.8.22	The 
PRO.8.22	Before his works of old.
PRO.8.23	I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
PRO.8.23	Or ever the earth was.
PRO.8.24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
PRO.8.24	When there were no fountains abounding with water.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled,
PRO.8.25	Before the hills was I brought forth:
PRO.8.26	While as yet he had not made the earth,
PRO.8.26	Nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	When he established the heavens, I was there:
PRO.8.27	When he set a circle upon the face of the deep:
PRO.8.28	When he made firm the sides above:
PRO.8.28	When the fountains of the deep became strong:
PRO.8.29	When he gave to the sea its bound,
PRO.8.29	That the waters should not transgress his commandment:
PRO.8.29	When he marked out the foundations of the earth:
PRO.8.30	Then I was by him, 
PRO.8.30	And I was daily 
PRO.8.30	Rejoicing always before him;
PRO.8.31	Rejoicing in his habitable earth;
PRO.8.31	And my delight was with the sons of men.
PRO.8.32	Now therefore, 
PRO.8.32	For blessed are they that keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	Hear instruction, and be wise,
PRO.8.33	And refuse it not.
PRO.8.34	Blessed is the man that heareth me,
PRO.8.34	Watching daily at my gates,
PRO.8.34	Waiting at the posts of my doors.
PRO.8.35	For whoso findeth me findeth life,
PRO.8.35	And shall obtain favour of the 
PRO.8.36	But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
PRO.8.36	All they that hate me love death.
PRO.9.1	Wisdom hath builded her house,
PRO.9.1	She hath hewn out her seven pillars:
PRO.9.2	She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
PRO.9.2	She hath also furnished her table.
PRO.9.3	She hath sent forth her maidens, she crieth
PRO.9.3	Upon the highest places of the city,
PRO.9.4	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
PRO.9.4	As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
PRO.9.5	Come, eat ye of my bread,
PRO.9.5	And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
PRO.9.6	Leave off, ye simple ones, and live;
PRO.9.6	And walk in the way of understanding.
PRO.9.7	He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame:
PRO.9.7	And he that reproveth a wicked man 
PRO.9.8	Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee:
PRO.9.8	Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
PRO.9.9	Give 
PRO.9.9	Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
PRO.9.10	The fear of the 
PRO.9.10	And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
PRO.9.11	For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
PRO.9.11	And the years of thy life shall be increased.
PRO.9.12	If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself:
PRO.9.12	And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
PRO.9.13	The foolish woman is clamorous;
PRO.9.14	And she sitteth at the door of her house,
PRO.9.14	On a seat in the high places of the city,
PRO.9.15	To call to them that pass by,
PRO.9.15	Who go right on their ways,
PRO.9.16	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
PRO.9.16	And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
PRO.9.17	Stolen waters are sweet,
PRO.9.17	And bread 
PRO.9.18	But he knoweth not that the dead are there;
PRO.9.18	That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
PRO.10.1	The proverbs of Solomon.
PRO.10.1	A wise son maketh a glad father:
PRO.10.1	But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
PRO.10.2	Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:
PRO.10.2	But righteousness delivereth from death.
PRO.10.3	The 
PRO.10.3	But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked.
PRO.10.4	He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand:
PRO.10.4	But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
PRO.10.5	He that gathereth in summer is a wise son:
PRO.10.6	Blessings are upon the head of the righteous:
PRO.10.6	But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.10.7	The memory of the just is blessed:
PRO.10.7	But the name of the wicked shall rot.
PRO.10.8	The wise in heart will receive commandments:
PRO.10.8	But a prating fool shall fall.
PRO.10.9	He that walketh uprightly walketh surely:
PRO.10.9	But he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
PRO.10.10	He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow:
PRO.10.10	But a prating fool shall fall.
PRO.10.11	The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life:
PRO.10.11	But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirreth up strifes:
PRO.10.12	But love covereth all transgressions.
PRO.10.13	In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found:
PRO.10.13	But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
PRO.10.14	Wise men lay up knowledge:
PRO.10.14	But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction.
PRO.10.15	The rich man's wealth is his strong city:
PRO.10.15	The destruction of the poor is their poverty.
PRO.10.16	The labour of the righteous 
PRO.10.16	The increase of the wicked to sin.
PRO.10.17	He is in the way of life that heedeth correction:
PRO.10.17	But he that forsaketh reproof erreth.
PRO.10.18	He that hideth hatred is of lying lips;
PRO.10.18	And he that uttereth a slander is a fool.
PRO.10.19	In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression:
PRO.10.19	But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely.
PRO.10.20	The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver:
PRO.10.20	The heart of the wicked is little worth.
PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many:
PRO.10.21	But the foolish die for lack of understanding.
PRO.10.22	The blessing of the 
PRO.10.22	And he addeth no sorrow therewith.
PRO.10.23	It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness:
PRO.10.23	And 
PRO.10.24	The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him:
PRO.10.24	And the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
PRO.10.25	When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more:
PRO.10.25	But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
PRO.10.26	As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
PRO.10.26	So is the sluggard to them that send him.
PRO.10.27	The fear of the 
PRO.10.27	But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
PRO.10.28	The hope of the righteous 
PRO.10.28	But the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
PRO.10.29	The way of the 
PRO.10.29	But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
PRO.10.30	The righteous shall never be removed:
PRO.10.30	But the wicked shall not dwell in the land.
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom:
PRO.10.31	But the froward tongue shall be cut off.
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable:
PRO.10.32	But the mouth of the wicked 
PRO.11.1	A false balance is an abomination to the 
PRO.11.1	But a just weight is his delight.
PRO.11.2	When pride cometh, then cometh shame:
PRO.11.2	But with the lowly is wisdom.
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright shall guide them:
PRO.11.3	But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.
PRO.11.4	Riches profit not in the day of wrath:
PRO.11.4	But righteousness delivereth from death.
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way:
PRO.11.5	But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them:
PRO.11.6	But they that deal treacherously shall be taken in their own mischief.
PRO.11.7	When a wicked man dieth 
PRO.11.7	And the hope of iniquity perisheth.
PRO.11.8	The righteous is delivered out of trouble,
PRO.11.8	And the wicked cometh in his stead.
PRO.11.9	With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbour:
PRO.11.9	But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.
PRO.11.10	When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth:
PRO.11.10	And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
PRO.11.11	By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted:
PRO.11.11	But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.11.12	He that despiseth his neighbour is void of wisdom:
PRO.11.12	But a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
PRO.11.13	He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
PRO.11.13	But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.
PRO.11.14	Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth:
PRO.11.14	But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
PRO.11.15	He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it:
PRO.11.15	But he that hateth suretiship is sure.
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman retaineth honour:
PRO.11.16	And violent men retain riches.
PRO.11.17	The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
PRO.11.17	But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
PRO.11.18	The wicked earneth deceitful wages:
PRO.11.18	But he that soweth righteousness 
PRO.11.19	He that is stedfast in righteousness 
PRO.11.19	And he that pursueth evil 
PRO.11.20	They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to the 
PRO.11.20	But such as are perfect in 
PRO.11.21	But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous is only good:
PRO.11.24	There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more;
PRO.11.24	And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but 
PRO.11.25	The liberal soul shall be made fat:
PRO.11.25	And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
PRO.11.26	He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him:
PRO.11.26	But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.
PRO.11.27	He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favour:
PRO.11.27	But he that searcheth after mischief, it shall come unto him.
PRO.11.28	He that trusteth in his riches shall fall:
PRO.11.28	But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.
PRO.11.29	He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind:
PRO.11.29	And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
PRO.11.30	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
PRO.11.30	And he that is wise winneth souls.
PRO.11.31	Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth:
PRO.11.31	How much more the wicked and the sinner!
PRO.12.1	Whoso loveth correction loveth knowledge:
PRO.12.1	But he that hateth reproof is brutish.
PRO.12.2	A good man shall obtain favour of the 
PRO.12.2	But a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
PRO.12.3	A man shall not be established by wickedness:
PRO.12.3	But the root of the righteous shall never be moved.
PRO.12.4	A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband:
PRO.12.4	But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.
PRO.12.5	The thoughts of the righteous are just:
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood:
PRO.12.6	But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown, and are not:
PRO.12.7	But the house of the righteous shall stand.
PRO.12.8	A man shall be commended according to his wisdom:
PRO.12.8	But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
PRO.12.9	Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant,
PRO.12.9	Than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.
PRO.12.10	A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:
PRO.12.10	But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
PRO.12.11	He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
PRO.12.11	But he that followeth after vain 
PRO.12.12	The wicked desireth the net of evil men:
PRO.12.12	But the root of the righteous yieldeth 
PRO.12.13	In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man:
PRO.12.13	But the righteous shall come out of trouble.
PRO.12.14	A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
PRO.12.14	And the doings of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.
PRO.12.15	The way of the foolish is right in his own eyes:
PRO.12.15	But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel.
PRO.12.16	A fool's vexation is presently known:
PRO.12.16	But a prudent man concealeth shame.
PRO.12.17	He that uttereth truth sheweth forth righteousness,
PRO.12.17	But a false witness deceit.
PRO.12.18	There is that speaketh rashly like the piercings of a sword:
PRO.12.18	But the tongue of the wise is health.
PRO.12.19	The lip of truth shall be established for ever:
PRO.12.19	But a lying tongue is but for a moment.
PRO.12.20	Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil:
PRO.12.20	But to the counsellors of peace is joy.
PRO.12.21	There shall no mischief happen to the righteous:
PRO.12.21	But the wicked shall be filled with evil.
PRO.12.22	Lying lips are an abomination to the 
PRO.12.22	But they that deal truly are his delight.
PRO.12.23	A prudent man concealeth knowledge:
PRO.12.23	But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.
PRO.12.24	The hand of the diligent shall bear rule:
PRO.12.24	But the slothful shall be put under taskwork.
PRO.12.25	Heaviness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop;
PRO.12.25	But a good word maketh it glad.
PRO.12.26	The righteous is a guide to his neighbour:
PRO.12.26	But the way of the wicked causeth them to err.
PRO.12.27	The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
PRO.12.27	But the precious substance of men 
PRO.12.28	In the way of righteousness is life;
PRO.12.28	And in the pathway thereof there is no death.
PRO.13.1	A wise son 
PRO.13.1	But a scorner heareth not rebuke.
PRO.13.2	A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth:
PRO.13.2	But the soul of the treacherous 
PRO.13.3	He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life:
PRO.13.4	The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing:
PRO.13.4	But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.
PRO.13.5	A righteous man hateth lying:
PRO.13.5	But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way:
PRO.13.6	But wickedness overthroweth the sinner.
PRO.13.7	There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing:
PRO.13.7	There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great wealth.
PRO.13.8	The ransom of a man's life is his riches:
PRO.13.8	But the poor heareth no threatening.
PRO.13.9	The light of the righteous rejoiceth:
PRO.13.9	But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
PRO.13.10	By pride cometh only contention:
PRO.13.10	But with the well advised is wisdom.
PRO.13.11	Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished:
PRO.13.11	But he that gathereth by labour shall have increase.
PRO.13.12	Hope deferred maketh the heart sick:
PRO.13.12	But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.
PRO.13.13	Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself:
PRO.13.13	But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
PRO.13.14	The law of the wise is a fountain of life,
PRO.13.14	To depart from the snares of death.
PRO.13.15	Good understanding giveth favour:
PRO.13.15	But the way of the treacherous is rugged.
PRO.13.16	Every prudent man worketh with knowledge:
PRO.13.16	But a fool spreadeth out folly.
PRO.13.17	A wicked messenger falleth into evil:
PRO.13.17	But a faithful ambassador is health.
PRO.13.18	Poverty and shame 
PRO.13.18	But he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.
PRO.13.19	The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul:
PRO.13.19	But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.
PRO.13.20	Walk with wise men, and thou shalt be wise:
PRO.13.20	But the companion of fools shall smart for it.
PRO.13.21	Evil pursueth sinners:
PRO.13.21	But the righteous shall be recompensed with good.
PRO.13.22	A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children;
PRO.13.22	And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous.
PRO.13.23	Much food 
PRO.13.23	But there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice.
PRO.13.24	He that spareth his rod hateth his son:
PRO.13.24	But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.
PRO.13.25	The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul:
PRO.13.25	But the belly of the wicked shall want.
PRO.14.1	Every wise woman buildeth her house:
PRO.14.1	But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands.
PRO.14.2	He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the 
PRO.14.2	But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.
PRO.14.3	In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride:
PRO.14.3	But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
PRO.14.4	Where no oxen are, the crib is clean:
PRO.14.4	But much increase is by the strength of the ox.
PRO.14.5	A faithful witness will not lie:
PRO.14.5	But a false witness uttereth lies.
PRO.14.6	A scorner seeketh wisdom, and 
PRO.14.6	But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding.
PRO.14.7	Go into the presence of a foolish man,
PRO.14.7	And thou shalt not perceive 
PRO.14.8	The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way:
PRO.14.8	But the folly of fools is deceit.
PRO.14.9	The foolish make a mock at guilt:
PRO.14.9	But among the upright there is good will.
PRO.14.10	The heart knoweth its own bitterness;
PRO.14.10	And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy.
PRO.14.11	The house of the wicked shall be overthrown:
PRO.14.11	But the tent of the upright shall flourish.
PRO.14.12	There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
PRO.14.12	But the end thereof are the ways of death.
PRO.14.13	Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful;
PRO.14.13	And the end of mirth is heaviness.
PRO.14.14	The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways:
PRO.14.14	And a good man 
PRO.14.15	The simple believeth every word:
PRO.14.15	But the prudent man looketh well to his going.
PRO.14.16	A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil:
PRO.14.16	But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident.
PRO.14.17	He that is soon angry will deal foolishly:
PRO.14.17	And a man of wicked devices is hated.
PRO.14.18	The simple inherit folly:
PRO.14.18	But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
PRO.14.19	The evil bow before the good;
PRO.14.19	And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
PRO.14.20	The poor is hated even of his own neighbour:
PRO.14.20	But the rich hath many friends.
PRO.14.21	He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth:
PRO.14.21	But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he.
PRO.14.22	Do they not err that devise evil?
PRO.14.22	But mercy and truth 
PRO.14.23	In all labour there is profit:
PRO.14.23	But the talk of the lips 
PRO.14.24	The crown of the wise is their riches:
PRO.14.25	A true witness delivereth souls:
PRO.14.25	But he that uttereth lies 
PRO.14.26	In the fear of the 
PRO.14.26	And his children shall have a place of refuge.
PRO.14.27	The fear of the 
PRO.14.27	To depart from the snares of death.
PRO.14.28	In the multitude of people is the king's glory:
PRO.14.28	But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.
PRO.14.29	He that is slow to anger is of great understanding:
PRO.14.29	But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
PRO.14.30	A sound heart is the life of the flesh:
PRO.14.30	But envy is the rottenness of the bones.
PRO.14.31	He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker:
PRO.14.31	But he that hath mercy on the needy honoureth him.
PRO.14.32	The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing:
PRO.14.32	But the righteous hath hope in his death.
PRO.14.33	Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
PRO.14.33	But 
PRO.14.34	Righteousness exalteth a nation:
PRO.14.34	But sin is a reproach to any people.
PRO.14.35	The king's favour is toward a servant that dealeth wisely:
PRO.14.35	But his wrath shall be 
PRO.15.1	A soft answer turneth away wrath:
PRO.15.1	But a grievous word stirreth up anger.
PRO.15.2	The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright:
PRO.15.2	But the mouth of fools poureth out folly.
PRO.15.3	The eyes of the 
PRO.15.3	Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.
PRO.15.4	A wholesome tongue is a tree of life:
PRO.15.4	But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit.
PRO.15.5	A fool despiseth his father's correction:
PRO.15.5	But he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence.
PRO.15.6	In the house of the righteous is much treasure:
PRO.15.6	But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
PRO.15.7	The lips of the wise disperse knowledge:
PRO.15.7	But the heart of the foolish 
PRO.15.8	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the 
PRO.15.8	But the prayer of the upright is his delight.
PRO.15.9	The way of the wicked is an abomination to the 
PRO.15.9	But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.
PRO.15.10	There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way:
PRO.15.11	Sheol and Abaddon are before the 
PRO.15.11	How much more then the hearts of the children of men!
PRO.15.12	A scorner loveth not to be reproved:
PRO.15.12	He will not go unto the wise.
PRO.15.13	A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance:
PRO.15.13	But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.
PRO.15.14	The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
PRO.15.14	But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.
PRO.15.15	All the days of the afflicted are evil:
PRO.15.15	But he that is of a cheerful heart 
PRO.15.16	Better is little with the fear of the 
PRO.15.16	Than great treasure and trouble therewith.
PRO.15.17	Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
PRO.15.17	Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
PRO.15.18	A wrathful man stirreth up contention:
PRO.15.18	But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.
PRO.15.19	The way of the sluggard is as an hedge of thorns:
PRO.15.19	But the path of the upright is made an highway.
PRO.15.20	A wise son maketh a glad father:
PRO.15.20	But a foolish man despiseth his mother.
PRO.15.21	Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom:
PRO.15.21	But a man of understanding maketh straight his going.
PRO.15.22	Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed:
PRO.15.22	But in the multitude of counsellors they are established.
PRO.15.23	A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth:
PRO.15.23	And a word in due season, how good is it!
PRO.15.24	To the wise the way of life 
PRO.15.24	That he may depart from Sheol beneath.
PRO.15.25	The 
PRO.15.25	But he will establish the border of the widow.
PRO.15.26	Evil devices are an abomination to the 
PRO.15.26	But pleasant words 
PRO.15.27	He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house:
PRO.15.27	But he that hateth gifts shall live.
PRO.15.28	The heart of the righteous studieth to answer:
PRO.15.28	But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
PRO.15.29	The 
PRO.15.29	But he heareth the prayer of the righteous.
PRO.15.30	The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart:
PRO.15.31	The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life
PRO.15.31	Shall abide among the wise.
PRO.15.32	He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul:
PRO.15.32	But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.
PRO.15.33	The fear of the 
PRO.15.33	and before honour 
PRO.16.1	The preparations of the heart belong to man:
PRO.16.1	But the answer of the tongue is from the 
PRO.16.2	All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes:
PRO.16.2	But the 
PRO.16.3	Commit thy works unto the 
PRO.16.3	And thy thoughts shall be established.
PRO.16.4	The 
PRO.16.4	Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
PRO.16.5	Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the 
PRO.16.6	By mercy and truth iniquity is purged:
PRO.16.6	And by the fear of the 
PRO.16.7	When a man's ways please the 
PRO.16.7	He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
PRO.16.8	Better is a little with righteousness
PRO.16.8	Than great revenues with injustice.
PRO.16.9	A man's heart deviseth his way:
PRO.16.9	But the 
PRO.16.10	A divine sentence is in the lips of the king:
PRO.16.10	His mouth shall not transgress in judgement.
PRO.16.11	A just balance and scales are the 
PRO.16.11	All the weights of the bag are his work.
PRO.16.12	It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness:
PRO.16.12	For the throne is established by righteousness.
PRO.16.13	Righteous lips are the delight or kings;
PRO.16.13	And they love him that speaketh right.
PRO.16.14	The wrath of a king is 
PRO.16.14	But a wise man will pacify it.
PRO.16.15	In the light of the king's countenance is life;
PRO.16.15	And his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.
PRO.16.16	How much better is it to get wisdom than gold!
PRO.16.16	Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.
PRO.16.17	The highway of the upright is to depart from evil:
PRO.16.17	He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
PRO.16.18	Pride 
PRO.16.18	And an haughty spirit before a fall.
PRO.16.19	Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,
PRO.16.19	Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
PRO.16.20	He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good:
PRO.16.20	And whoso trusteth in the 
PRO.16.21	The wise in heart shall be called prudent:
PRO.16.21	And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
PRO.16.22	Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
PRO.16.22	But the correction of fools is 
PRO.16.23	The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth,
PRO.16.23	And addeth learning to his lips.
PRO.16.24	Pleasant words are 
PRO.16.24	Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
PRO.16.25	There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
PRO.16.25	But the end thereof are the ways of death.
PRO.16.26	The appetite of the labouring man laboureth for him;
PRO.16.26	For his mouth craveth it of him.
PRO.16.27	A worthless man deviseth mischief:
PRO.16.27	And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.
PRO.16.28	A froward man scattereth abroad strife:
PRO.16.28	And a whisperer separateth chief friends.
PRO.16.29	A man of violence enticeth his neighbour,
PRO.16.29	And leadeth him in a way that is not good.
PRO.16.30	He that shutteth his eyes, 
PRO.16.30	He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass.
PRO.16.31	The hoary head is a crown of glory,
PRO.16.31	It shall be found in the way of righteousness.
PRO.16.32	He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
PRO.16.32	And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
PRO.16.33	The lot is cast into the lap;
PRO.16.33	But the whole disposing thereof is of the 
PRO.17.1	Better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith,
PRO.17.1	Than an house full of feasting with strife.
PRO.17.2	A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
PRO.17.2	And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren.
PRO.17.3	The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold:
PRO.17.3	But the 
PRO.17.4	An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips;
PRO.17.5	Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:
PRO.17.6	Children's children are the crown of old men;
PRO.17.6	And the glory of children are their fathers.
PRO.17.7	Excellent speech becometh not a fool:
PRO.17.7	Much less do lying lips a prince.
PRO.17.8	A gift is 
PRO.17.8	Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
PRO.17.9	He that covereth a transgression seeketh love:
PRO.17.9	But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.
PRO.17.10	A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding
PRO.17.10	Than an hundred stripes into a fool.
PRO.17.11	An evil man seeketh only rebellion;
PRO.17.11	Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
PRO.17.12	Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
PRO.17.12	Rather than a fool in his folly.
PRO.17.13	Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
PRO.17.13	Evil shall not depart from his house.
PRO.17.14	The beginning of strife is 
PRO.17.14	Therefore leave off contention, before there be quarrelling.
PRO.17.15	He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous,
PRO.17.15	Both of them alike are an abomination to the 
PRO.17.16	Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
PRO.17.16	Seeing he hath no understanding?
PRO.17.17	A friend loveth at all times,
PRO.17.17	And a brother is born for adversity.
PRO.17.18	A man void of understanding striketh hands,
PRO.17.18	And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbour.
PRO.17.19	He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
PRO.17.19	He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction.
PRO.17.20	He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
PRO.17.20	And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
PRO.17.21	He that begetteth a fool 
PRO.17.21	And the father of a fool hath no joy.
PRO.17.22	A merry heart is a good medicine:
PRO.17.22	But a broken spirit drieth up the bones.
PRO.17.23	A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom,
PRO.17.23	To pervert the ways of judgement.
PRO.17.24	Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding:
PRO.17.24	But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
PRO.17.25	A foolish son is a grief to his father,
PRO.17.25	And bitterness to her that bare him.
PRO.17.26	Also to punish the righteous is not good,
PRO.17.27	He that spareth his words hath knowledge:
PRO.17.27	And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
PRO.17.28	Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
PRO.17.28	When he shutteth his lips, he is 
PRO.18.1	He that separateth himself seeketh 
PRO.18.1	And rageth against all sound wisdom.
PRO.18.2	A fool hath no delight in understanding,
PRO.18.2	But only that his heart may reveal itself.
PRO.18.3	When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt,
PRO.18.3	And with ignominy cometh reproach.
PRO.18.4	The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters;
PRO.18.4	The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.
PRO.18.5	To accept the person of the wicked is not good,
PRO.18.6	A fool's lips enter into contention,
PRO.18.6	And his mouth calleth for stripes.
PRO.18.7	A fool's mouth is his destruction,
PRO.18.7	And his lips are the snare of his soul.
PRO.18.8	The words of a whisperer are as dainty, morsels,
PRO.18.8	And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.18.9	He also that is slack in his work
PRO.18.9	Is brother to him that is a destroyer.
PRO.18.10	The name of the 
PRO.18.10	The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
PRO.18.11	The rich man's wealth is his strong city,
PRO.18.11	And as an high wall in his own imagination.
PRO.18.12	Before destruction the heart of man is haughty,
PRO.18.12	And before honour 
PRO.18.13	He that giveth answer before he heareth,
PRO.18.13	It is folly and shame unto him.
PRO.18.14	The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
PRO.18.14	But a broken spirit who can bear?
PRO.18.15	The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
PRO.18.15	And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
PRO.18.16	A man's gift maketh room for him,
PRO.18.16	And bringeth him before great men.
PRO.18.17	He that pleadeth his cause first 
PRO.18.17	But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out.
PRO.18.18	The lot causeth contentions to cease,
PRO.18.18	And parteth between the mighty.
PRO.18.19	A brother offended 
PRO.18.19	And 
PRO.18.20	A man's belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth;
PRO.18.20	With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
PRO.18.21	And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
PRO.18.22	Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing,
PRO.18.22	And obtaineth favour of the 
PRO.18.23	The poor useth entreaties:
PRO.18.23	But the rich answereth roughly.
PRO.18.24	He that maketh many friends 
PRO.18.24	But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity
PRO.19.1	Than he that perverse in his lips and is a fool.
PRO.19.2	Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good;
PRO.19.2	And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man subverteth his way;
PRO.19.3	And his heart fretteth against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth addeth many friends:
PRO.19.4	But the poor is separated from his friend.
PRO.19.5	A false witness shall not be unpunished;
PRO.19.5	And he that uttereth lies shall not escape.
PRO.19.6	Many will entreat the favour of the liberal man:
PRO.19.6	And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
PRO.19.7	All the brethren of the poor do hate him:
PRO.19.7	How much more do his friends go far from him!
PRO.19.7	He pursueth 
PRO.19.8	He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
PRO.19.8	He that keepeth understanding shall find good.
PRO.19.9	A false witness shall not be unpunished;
PRO.19.9	And he that uttereth lies shall perish.
PRO.19.10	Delicate living is not seemly for a fool;
PRO.19.10	Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
PRO.19.11	The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger;
PRO.19.11	And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
PRO.19.12	The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
PRO.19.12	But his favour is as dew upon the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish son is the calamity of his father:
PRO.19.13	And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
PRO.19.14	House and riches are an inheritance from fathers:
PRO.19.14	But a prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
PRO.19.15	And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.
PRO.19.16	He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul:
PRO.19.17	He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the 
PRO.19.17	And his good deed will he pay him again.
PRO.19.18	Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope;
PRO.19.18	And set not thy heart on his destruction.
PRO.19.19	A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty:
PRO.19.19	For if thou deliver 
PRO.19.20	Hear counsel, and receive instruction,
PRO.19.20	That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
PRO.19.21	There are many devices in a man's heart;
PRO.19.21	But the counsel of the 
PRO.19.22	The desire of a man is 
PRO.19.22	And a poor man is better than a liar.
PRO.19.23	The fear of the 
PRO.19.23	And he 
PRO.19.23	He shall not be visited with evil.
PRO.19.24	The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish,
PRO.19.24	And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
PRO.19.25	Smite a scorner, and the simple will learn prudence:
PRO.19.25	And reprove one that hath understanding, 
PRO.19.26	He that spoileth his father, and chaseth away his mother,
PRO.19.26	Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach.
PRO.19.27	Cease, my son, to hear instruction
PRO.19.28	A worthless witness mocketh at judgement:
PRO.19.28	And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Judgments are prepared for scorners,
PRO.19.29	And stripes for the back of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler;
PRO.20.1	And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise.
PRO.20.2	The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion:
PRO.20.2	He that provoketh him to anger sinneth 
PRO.20.3	It is an honour for a man to keep aloof from strife:
PRO.20.3	But every fool will be quarrelling.
PRO.20.4	The slothful will not plow by reason of the winter;
PRO.20.4	Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
PRO.20.5	Counsel in the heart of man is 
PRO.20.5	But a man of understanding will draw it out.
PRO.20.6	Most men wilt proclaim every one his own kindness:
PRO.20.6	But a faithful man who can find?
PRO.20.7	A just man that walketh in his integrity,
PRO.20.7	Blessed are his children after him.
PRO.20.8	A king that sitteth on the throne of judgement
PRO.20.8	Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, I have made my heart clean,
PRO.20.9	I am pure from my sin?
PRO.20.10	Divers weights, and divers measures,
PRO.20.10	Both of them alike are an abomination to the 
PRO.20.11	Even a child maketh himself known by his doings,
PRO.20.11	Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
PRO.20.12	The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,
PRO.20.12	The 
PRO.20.13	Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty;
PRO.20.13	Open thine eyes, 
PRO.20.14	It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer:
PRO.20.14	But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
PRO.20.15	There is gold, and abundance of rubies:
PRO.20.15	But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
PRO.20.16	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
PRO.20.16	And hold him in pledge 
PRO.20.17	Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man;
PRO.20.17	But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
PRO.20.18	Every purpose is established by counsel:
PRO.20.18	And by wise guidance make thou war,
PRO.20.19	He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
PRO.20.19	Therefore meddle not with him that openeth wide his lips.
PRO.20.20	Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
PRO.20.20	His lamp shall be put out in the blackest darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance 
PRO.20.21	But the end thereof shall not be blessed.
PRO.20.22	Say not thou, I will recompense evil:
PRO.20.22	Wait on the 
PRO.20.23	Divers weights are an abomination to the 
PRO.20.23	And a false balance is not good.
PRO.20.24	A man's goings are of the 
PRO.20.24	How then can man understand his way?
PRO.20.25	It is a snare to a man rashly to say, 
PRO.20.25	And after vows to make inquiry.
PRO.20.26	A wise king winnoweth the wicked,
PRO.20.26	And bringeth the 
PRO.20.27	The spirit of man is the lamp of the 
PRO.20.27	Searching all the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.20.28	Mercy and truth preserve the king:
PRO.20.28	And his throne is upholden by mercy.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength:
PRO.20.29	And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.
PRO.20.30	Stripes that wound cleanse away evil:
PRO.20.30	And strokes 
PRO.21.1	The king's heart is in the hand of the 
PRO.21.1	He turneth it whithersoever he will.
PRO.21.2	Every way of a man is right in his own eyes:
PRO.21.2	But the 
PRO.21.3	To do justice and judgement
PRO.21.3	Is more acceptable to the 
PRO.21.4	An high look, and a proud heart,
PRO.21.5	The thoughts of the diligent 
PRO.21.5	But every one that is hasty 
PRO.21.6	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
PRO.21.6	Is a vapour driven to and fro; they 
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away;
PRO.21.7	Because they refuse to do judgement.
PRO.21.8	The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked:
PRO.21.8	But as for the pure, his work is right.
PRO.21.9	It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
PRO.21.9	Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desireth evil:
PRO.21.10	His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise:
PRO.21.11	And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
PRO.21.12	The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked;
PRO.21.13	Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
PRO.21.13	He also shall cry, but shall not be heard.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret pacifieth anger,
PRO.21.14	And a present in the bosom strong wrath.
PRO.21.15	It is joy to the righteous to do judgement;
PRO.21.15	But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
PRO.21.16	The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
PRO.21.16	Shall rest in the congregation of the dead.
PRO.21.17	He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:
PRO.21.17	He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
PRO.21.18	The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;
PRO.21.18	And the treacherous 
PRO.21.19	It is better to dwell in a desert land,
PRO.21.19	Than with a contentious and fretful woman.
PRO.21.20	There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
PRO.21.20	But a foolish man swalloweth it up.
PRO.21.21	He that followeth after righteousness and mercy
PRO.21.21	Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
PRO.21.22	A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty,
PRO.21.22	And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
PRO.21.23	Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
PRO.21.23	Keepeth his soul from troubles.
PRO.21.24	The proud and haughty man, scorner is his name,
PRO.21.24	He worketh in the arrogance of pride.
PRO.21.25	The desire of the slothful killeth him;
PRO.21.25	For his hands refuse to labour.
PRO.21.26	There is that coveteth greedily all the day long:
PRO.21.26	But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination:
PRO.21.27	How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind!
PRO.21.28	A false witness shall perish:
PRO.21.28	But the man that heareth shall speak unchallenged.
PRO.21.29	A wicked man hardeneth his face:
PRO.21.29	But as for the upright, he ordereth his ways.
PRO.21.30	There is no wisdom nor understanding
PRO.21.30	Nor counsel against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is prepared against the day of battle:
PRO.21.31	But victory is of the 
PRO.22.1	A 
PRO.22.2	The rich and the poor meet together:
PRO.22.2	The 
PRO.22.3	A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself:
PRO.22.3	But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
PRO.22.4	The reward of humility 
PRO.22.5	Thorns 
PRO.22.5	He that keepeth his soul shall be far from them.
PRO.22.6	Train up a child in the way he should go,
PRO.22.6	And even when he is old he will not depart from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich ruleth over the poor,
PRO.22.7	And the borrower is servant to the lender.
PRO.22.8	He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity:
PRO.22.8	And the rod of his wrath shall fail.
PRO.22.9	He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
PRO.22.9	For he giveth of his bread to the poor.
PRO.22.10	Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out;
PRO.22.10	Yea, strife and ignominy shall cease.
PRO.22.11	He that loveth pureness of heart,
PRO.22.12	The eyes of the 
PRO.22.12	But he overthroweth the words of the treacherous man.
PRO.22.13	The sluggard saith, There is a lion without:
PRO.22.13	I shall be murdered in the streets.
PRO.22.14	The mouth of strange women is a deep pit:
PRO.22.14	He that is abhorred of the 
PRO.22.15	Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;
PRO.22.16	He that oppresseth the poor to increase his 
PRO.22.17	Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,
PRO.22.17	And apply thine heart unto my knowledge.
PRO.22.18	For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee,
PRO.22.18	If they be established together upon thy lips.
PRO.22.19	That thy trust may be in the 
PRO.22.19	I have made 
PRO.22.20	Have not I written unto thee excellent things
PRO.22.20	Of counsels and knowledge;
PRO.22.21	To make thee know the certainty of the words of truth,
PRO.22.21	That thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee?
PRO.22.22	Rob not the poor, because he is poor,
PRO.22.22	Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
PRO.22.23	For the 
PRO.22.23	And despoil of life those that despoil them.
PRO.22.24	Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger;
PRO.22.24	And with a wrathful man thou shalt not go:
PRO.22.25	Lest thou learn his ways,
PRO.22.25	And get a snare to thy soul.
PRO.22.26	Be thou not one of them that strike hands,
PRO.22.27	If thou hast not wherewith to pay,
PRO.22.27	Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
PRO.22.28	Remove not the ancient landmark,
PRO.22.28	Which thy fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings;
PRO.22.29	He shall not stand before mean men.
PRO.23.1	When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	Consider diligently him that is before thee;
PRO.23.2	And put a knife to thy throat,
PRO.23.2	If thou be a man given to appetite.
PRO.23.3	Be not desirous of his dainties;
PRO.23.3	Seeing they are deceitful meat.
PRO.23.4	Weary not thyself to be rich;
PRO.23.4	Cease from thine own wisdom.
PRO.23.5	Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?
PRO.23.5	For 
PRO.23.5	Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.
PRO.23.6	Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye,
PRO.23.6	Neither desire thou his dainties:
PRO.23.7	For as he reckoneth within himself, so is he:
PRO.23.7	Eat and drink, saith he to thee;
PRO.23.7	But his heart is not with thee.
PRO.23.8	The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up,
PRO.23.8	And lose thy sweet words.
PRO.23.9	Speak not in the hearing of a fool;
PRO.23.9	For he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
PRO.23.10	Remove not the ancient landmark;
PRO.23.10	And enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
PRO.23.11	For their redeemer is strong;
PRO.23.11	He shall plead their cause against thee.
PRO.23.12	Apply thine heart unto instruction,
PRO.23.12	And thine ears to the words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Withhold not correction from the child:
PRO.23.14	Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
PRO.23.14	And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.
PRO.23.15	My son, if thine heart be wise,
PRO.23.15	My heart shall be glad, even mine:
PRO.23.16	Yea, my reins shall rejoice,
PRO.23.16	When thy lips speak right things.
PRO.23.17	Let not thine heart envy sinners:
PRO.23.17	But 
PRO.23.18	For surely there is a reward;
PRO.23.18	And thy hope shall not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Hear thou, my son, and be wise,
PRO.23.19	And guide thine heart in the way.
PRO.23.20	Be not among winebibbers;
PRO.23.20	Among gluttonous eaters of flesh:
PRO.23.21	For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:
PRO.23.21	And drowsiness shall clothe 
PRO.23.22	Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,
PRO.23.22	And despise not thy mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy the truth, and sell it not;
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice:
PRO.23.24	And he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.
PRO.23.25	Let thy father and thy mother be glad,
PRO.23.25	And let her that bare thee rejoice.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me thine heart,
PRO.23.26	And let thine eyes delight in my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a whore is a deep ditch;
PRO.23.27	And a strange woman is a narrow pit.
PRO.23.28	Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber,
PRO.23.28	And increaseth the treacherous among men.
PRO.23.29	Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions?
PRO.23.29	Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause?
PRO.23.29	Who hath redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	They that tarry long at the wine;
PRO.23.30	They that go to seek out mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	When it giveth its colour in the cup,
PRO.23.31	When it goeth down smoothly:
PRO.23.32	At the last it biteth like a serpent,
PRO.23.32	And stingeth like an adder.
PRO.23.33	Thine eyes shall behold strange things,
PRO.23.33	And thine heart shall utter froward things.
PRO.23.34	Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
PRO.23.34	Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
PRO.23.35	They have stricken me, 
PRO.23.35	They have beaten me, and I felt it not:
PRO.23.35	When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
PRO.24.1	Be not thou envious against evil men,
PRO.24.1	Neither desire to be with them.
PRO.24.2	For their heart studieth oppression,
PRO.24.2	And their lips talk of mischief.
PRO.24.3	Through wisdom is an house builded;
PRO.24.3	And by understanding it is established:
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge are the chambers filled
PRO.24.4	With all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man is strong;
PRO.24.5	Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth might.
PRO.24.6	For by wise guidance thou shalt make thy war:
PRO.24.6	And in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too high for a fool:
PRO.24.7	He openeth not his mouth in the gate.
PRO.24.8	He that deviseth to do evil,
PRO.24.8	Men shall call him a mischievous person.
PRO.24.9	The thought of the foolish is sin:
PRO.24.9	And the scorner is an abomination to men.
PRO.24.10	If thou faint in the day of adversity,
PRO.24.10	Thy strength is small.
PRO.24.11	Deliver them that are carried away unto death,
PRO.24.11	And those that are ready to be slain see that thou hold back.
PRO.24.12	If thou sayest, Behold, we knew not this:
PRO.24.12	Doth not he that weigheth the hearts consider it?
PRO.24.12	And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?
PRO.24.12	And shall not he render to every man according to his work?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat thou honey, for it is good;
PRO.24.13	And the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:
PRO.24.14	So shalt thou know wisdom to be unto thy soul
PRO.24.14	If thou hast found it, then shall there be a reward,
PRO.24.14	And thy hope shall not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous;
PRO.24.15	Spoil not his resting place:
PRO.24.16	For a righteous man falleth seven times, and riseth up again:
PRO.24.16	But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
PRO.24.17	Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
PRO.24.17	And let not thine heart be glad when he is overthrown:
PRO.24.18	Lest the 
PRO.24.18	And he turn away his wrath from him.
PRO.24.19	Fret not thyself because of evil-doers;
PRO.24.19	Neither be thou envious at the wicked:
PRO.24.20	For there will be no reward to the evil man;
PRO.24.20	The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear thou the 
PRO.24.22	For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
PRO.24.22	And who knoweth the destruction of them both?
PRO.24.23	These also are 
PRO.24.23	To have respect of persons in judgement is not good.
PRO.24.24	He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous;
PRO.24.24	Peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him:
PRO.24.25	But to them that rebuke 
PRO.24.25	And a good blessing shall come upon them.
PRO.24.26	He kisseth the lips
PRO.24.26	That giveth a right answer.
PRO.24.27	Prepare thy work without,
PRO.24.27	And make it ready for thee in the field;
PRO.24.27	And afterwards build thine house.
PRO.24.28	Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause;
PRO.24.28	And deceive not with thy lips.
PRO.24.29	Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me;
PRO.24.29	I will render to the man according to his work.
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the slothful,
PRO.24.30	And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
PRO.24.31	And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,
PRO.24.31	The face thereof was covered with nettles,
PRO.24.31	And the stone wall thereof was broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then I beheld, and considered well:
PRO.24.32	I saw, and received instruction.
PRO.24.33	A little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.24.34	So shall thy poverty come as a robber;
PRO.24.34	And thy want as an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a thing:
PRO.25.2	But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
PRO.25.3	The heaven for height, and the earth for depth,
PRO.25.3	And the heart of kings is unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	And there cometh forth a vessel for the finer:
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked 
PRO.25.5	And his throne shall be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king,
PRO.25.6	And stand not in the place of great men:
PRO.25.7	For better is it that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
PRO.25.7	Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince,
PRO.25.7	Whom thine eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Go not forth hastily to strive,
PRO.25.8	Lest 
PRO.25.8	When thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
PRO.25.9	Debate thy cause with thy neighbour 
PRO.25.9	And disclose not the secret of another:
PRO.25.10	Lest he that heareth it revile thee,
PRO.25.10	And thine infamy turn not away.
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken
PRO.25.11	Is 
PRO.25.13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
PRO.25.13	For he refresheth the soul of his masters.
PRO.25.15	By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded,
PRO.25.15	And a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
PRO.25.16	Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee;
PRO.25.16	Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbour's house;
PRO.25.17	Lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.
PRO.25.18	A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour
PRO.25.18	Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
PRO.25.19	Is 
PRO.25.20	So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
PRO.25.21	And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
PRO.25.22	For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
PRO.25.22	And the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind bringeth forth rain:
PRO.25.23	So doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.
PRO.25.24	It is better to dwell in the comer of the housetop,
PRO.25.24	Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
PRO.25.25	So is good news from a far country.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey:
PRO.25.27	So 
PRO.25.28	He whose spirit is without restraint
PRO.25.28	Is 
PRO.26.1	As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	So honour is not seemly for a fool.
PRO.26.2	As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying,
PRO.26.2	So the curse that is causeless lighteth not.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
PRO.26.3	And a rod for the back of fools.
PRO.26.4	Answer not a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	Lest thou also be like unto him.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	Lest he be wise in his own conceit.
PRO.26.6	He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
PRO.26.6	Cutteth off 
PRO.26.7	The legs of the lame hang loose:
PRO.26.7	So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.8	As a bag of gems in a heap of stones,
PRO.26.8	So is he that giveth honour to a fool.
PRO.26.9	So is a parable in the month of fools
PRO.26.10	So is he that hireth the fool and he that hireth them that pass by.
PRO.26.11	As a dog that returneth to his vomit,
PRO.26.12	Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope of a fool than of him.
PRO.26.13	The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way;
PRO.26.13	A lion is in the streets.
PRO.26.14	So doth the sluggard upon his bed.
PRO.26.15	The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish;
PRO.26.15	It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
PRO.26.16	Than seven men that can render a reason.
PRO.26.17	He that passeth by, 
PRO.26.17	Is 
PRO.26.18	As a madman who casteth firebrands,
PRO.26.18	Arrows, and death;
PRO.26.19	So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour,
PRO.26.19	And saith, Am not I in sport?
PRO.26.20	For lack of wood the fire goeth out:
PRO.26.20	And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.
PRO.26.21	So is a contentious man to inflame strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
PRO.26.22	And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.26.23	Fervent lips and a wicked heart
PRO.26.23	Are 
PRO.26.24	He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
PRO.26.24	But he layeth up deceit within him:
PRO.26.25	When he speaketh fair, believe him not;
PRO.26.25	For there are seven abominations in his heart:
PRO.26.26	Though 
PRO.26.26	His wickedness shall be openly shewed before the congregation.
PRO.26.27	Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:
PRO.26.27	And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded;
PRO.26.28	And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
PRO.27.1	Boast not thyself of tomorrow;
PRO.27.1	For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
PRO.27.2	Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
PRO.27.2	A stranger, and not thine own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
PRO.27.3	But a fool's vexation is heavier than them both.
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous;
PRO.27.4	But who is able to stand before jealousy?
PRO.27.5	Better is open rebuke
PRO.27.5	Than love that is hidden.
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend:
PRO.27.6	But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
PRO.27.7	The full soul loatheth an honeycomb:
PRO.27.7	But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
PRO.27.8	So is a man that wandereth from his place.
PRO.27.9	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:
PRO.27.9	So doth the sweetness of a man's friend 
PRO.27.10	Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
PRO.27.10	And go not to thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
PRO.27.10	Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
PRO.27.11	My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
PRO.27.11	That I may answer him that reproacheth me
PRO.27.12	A prudent man seeth the evil, 
PRO.27.13	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
PRO.27.13	And hold him in pledge 
PRO.27.14	He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	It shall be counted a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	A continual dropping in a very rainy day
PRO.27.15	And a contentious woman are alike:
PRO.27.16	He that would restrain her restraineth the wind,
PRO.27.16	And his right hand encountereth oil.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpeneth iron;
PRO.27.17	So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
PRO.27.18	Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof;
PRO.27.18	And he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
PRO.27.19	As in water face 
PRO.27.19	So the heart of man to man.
PRO.27.20	Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;
PRO.27.20	And the eyes of man are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
PRO.27.21	And a man is 
PRO.27.22	Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among bruised corn,
PRO.27.22	Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
PRO.27.23	Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
PRO.27.24	For riches are not for ever;
PRO.27.24	And doth the crown endure unto all generations?
PRO.27.25	The hay is carried, and the tender grass sheweth itself,
PRO.27.25	And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.
PRO.27.26	The lambs are for thy clothing,
PRO.27.26	And the goats are the price of the field:
PRO.27.27	And 
PRO.27.27	And maintenance for thy maidens.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no man pursueth:
PRO.28.1	But the righteous are bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
PRO.28.2	But by men of understanding 
PRO.28.3	A needy man that oppresseth the poor
PRO.28.3	Is 
PRO.28.4	They that forsake the law praise the wicked:
PRO.28.4	But such as keep the law contend with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men understand not judgement:
PRO.28.5	But they that seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity,
PRO.28.6	Than he that is perverse in 
PRO.28.7	Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:
PRO.28.7	But he that is a companion of gluttonous men shameth his father.
PRO.28.8	He that augmenteth his substance by usury and increase,
PRO.28.8	Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor.
PRO.28.9	He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
PRO.28.9	Even his prayer is an abomination.
PRO.28.10	Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way,
PRO.28.10	He shall fall himself into his own pit:
PRO.28.10	But the perfect shall inherit good.
PRO.28.11	The rich man is wise in his own conceit;
PRO.28.11	But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory:
PRO.28.12	But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
PRO.28.13	He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper:
PRO.28.13	But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.
PRO.28.14	Happy is the man that feareth alway:
PRO.28.14	But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
PRO.28.16	The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor:
PRO.28.17	A man that is laden with the blood of any person
PRO.28.17	Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him.
PRO.28.18	Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered:
PRO.28.18	But he that is perverse in 
PRO.28.19	He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
PRO.28.19	But he that followeth after vain 
PRO.28.20	A faithful man shall abound with blessings:
PRO.28.20	But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.
PRO.28.21	To have respect of persons is not good:
PRO.28.21	Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches,
PRO.28.22	And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favour
PRO.28.23	Than he that flattereth with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression;
PRO.28.24	The same is the companion of a destroyer.
PRO.28.25	He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife:
PRO.28.25	But he that putteth his trust in the 
PRO.28.26	He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
PRO.28.26	But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
PRO.28.27	He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:
PRO.28.27	But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves:
PRO.28.28	But when they perish, the righteous increase.
PRO.29.1	He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck
PRO.29.1	Shall suddenly be broken, and that without remedy.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice:
PRO.29.2	But when a wicked man beareth rule, the people sigh.
PRO.29.3	Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father:
PRO.29.3	But he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth 
PRO.29.4	The king by judgement establisheth the land:
PRO.29.4	But he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it.
PRO.29.5	A man that flattereth his neighbour
PRO.29.5	Spreadeth a net for his steps.
PRO.29.6	In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare:
PRO.29.6	But the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
PRO.29.7	The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor:
PRO.29.7	The wicked hath not understanding to know 
PRO.29.8	Scornful men set a city in a flame:
PRO.29.8	But wise men turn away wrath.
PRO.29.9	If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man,
PRO.29.9	Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest.
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect:
PRO.29.10	And as for the upright, they seek his life.
PRO.29.11	A fool uttereth all his anger:
PRO.29.11	But a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood,
PRO.29.12	All his servants are wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor man and the oppressor meet together:
PRO.29.13	The 
PRO.29.14	The king that faithfully judgeth the poor,
PRO.29.14	His throne shall be established for ever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof give wisdom:
PRO.29.15	But a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth:
PRO.29.16	But the righteous shall look upon their fall.
PRO.29.17	Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest;
PRO.29.17	Yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint:
PRO.29.18	But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
PRO.29.19	A servant will not be corrected by words:
PRO.29.19	For though he understand he will not give heed.
PRO.29.20	Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope of a fool than of him.
PRO.29.21	He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child
PRO.29.21	Shall have him become a son at the last.
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirreth up strife,
PRO.29.22	And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.
PRO.29.23	A man's pride shall bring him low:
PRO.29.23	But he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honour.
PRO.29.24	Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul:
PRO.29.24	He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing.
PRO.29.25	The fear of man bringeth a snare:
PRO.29.25	But whoso putteth his trust in the 
PRO.29.26	Many seek the ruler's favour:
PRO.29.26	But a man's judgement 
PRO.29.27	An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous:
PRO.29.27	And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the oracle.
PRO.30.1	The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:
PRO.30.2	Surely I am more brutish than any man,
PRO.30.2	And have not the understanding of a man:
PRO.30.3	And I have not learned wisdom,
PRO.30.3	Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended?
PRO.30.4	Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who hath bound the waters in his garment?
PRO.30.4	Who hath established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is tried:
PRO.30.5	He is a shield unto them that trust in him.
PRO.30.6	Add thou not unto his words,
PRO.30.6	Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things have I asked of thee;
PRO.30.7	Deny me 
PRO.30.8	Remove far from me vanity and lies:
PRO.30.8	Give me neither poverty nor riches;
PRO.30.8	Feed me with the food that is needful for me:
PRO.30.9	Lest I be full, and deny 
PRO.30.9	Or lest I be poor, and steal,
PRO.30.9	And use profanely the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	Slander not a servant unto his master,
PRO.30.10	Lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that curseth their father,
PRO.30.11	And doth not bless their mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes;
PRO.30.12	And 
PRO.30.13	There is a generation, Oh how lofty are their eyes!
PRO.30.13	And their eyelids are lifted up.
PRO.30.14	There is a generation whose teeth are 
PRO.30.14	To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
PRO.30.15	The horseleach hath two daughters, 
PRO.30.15	There are three things that are never satisfied,
PRO.30.16	The grave; and the barren womb;
PRO.30.16	The earth that is not satisfied with water;
PRO.30.16	And the fire that saith not, Enough.
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocketh at his father,
PRO.30.17	And despiseth to obey his mother,
PRO.30.17	The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
PRO.30.17	And the young eagles shall eat it.
PRO.30.18	There be three things which are too wonderful for me,
PRO.30.18	Yea, four which I know not:
PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the air;
PRO.30.19	The way of a serpent upon a rock;
PRO.30.19	The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
PRO.30.19	And the way of a man with a maid.
PRO.30.20	So is the way of an adulterous woman;
PRO.30.20	She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
PRO.30.20	And saith, I have done no wickedness.
PRO.30.21	For three things the earth doth tremble,
PRO.30.21	And for four, 
PRO.30.22	For a servant when he is king;
PRO.30.22	And a fool when he is filled with meat;
PRO.30.23	For an odious woman when she is married;
PRO.30.23	And an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There be four things which are little upon the earth,
PRO.30.24	But they are exceeding wise:
PRO.30.25	The ants are a people not strong,
PRO.30.25	Yet they provide their meat in the summer;
PRO.30.26	The conies are but a feeble folk,
PRO.30.26	Yet make they their houses in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	Yet go they forth all of them by bands;
PRO.30.28	The lizard taketh hold with her hands,
PRO.30.28	Yet is she in kings' palaces,
PRO.30.29	There be three things which are stately in their march,
PRO.30.29	Yea, four which are stately in going:
PRO.30.30	The lion, which is mightiest among beasts,
PRO.30.30	And turneth not away for any;
PRO.30.31	The greyhound; the he-goat also;
PRO.30.31	And the king, against whom there is no rising up.
PRO.30.32	If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
PRO.30.32	Or if thou hast thought evil,
PRO.30.33	For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
PRO.30.33	And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
PRO.30.33	So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
PRO.31.2	What, my son? and what, O son of my womb,
PRO.31.2	And what, O son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Give not thy strength unto women,
PRO.31.3	Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;
PRO.31.4	Nor for princes 
PRO.31.5	Lest they drink, and forget the law,
PRO.31.5	And pervert the judgement of any that is afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
PRO.31.6	And wine unto the bitter in soul:
PRO.31.7	Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
PRO.31.7	And remember his misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open thy mouth for the dumb,
PRO.31.8	In the cause of all such as are left desolate.
PRO.31.9	Open thy mouth, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	And minister judgement to the poor and needy.
PRO.31.10	A virtuous woman who can find?
PRO.31.10	For her price is far above rubies.
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband trusteth in her,
PRO.31.11	And he shall have no lack of gain.
PRO.31.12	She doeth him good and not evil
PRO.31.12	All the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeketh wool and flax,
PRO.31.13	And worketh willingly with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchant-ships;
PRO.31.14	She bringeth her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She riseth also while it is yet night,
PRO.31.15	And giveth meat to her household,
PRO.31.15	And their task to her maidens.
PRO.31.16	She considereth a field, and buyeth it:
PRO.31.16	With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girdeth her loins with strength,
PRO.31.17	And maketh strong her arms.
PRO.31.18	She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable:
PRO.31.18	Her lamp goeth not out by night.
PRO.31.19	She layeth her hands to the distaff,
PRO.31.19	And her hands hold the spindle.
PRO.31.20	She spreadeth out her hand to the poor;
PRO.31.20	Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household;
PRO.31.21	For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
PRO.31.22	She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry;
PRO.31.22	Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates,
PRO.31.23	When he sitteth among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She maketh linen garments and selleth them;
PRO.31.24	And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing;
PRO.31.25	And she laugheth at the time to come.
PRO.31.26	She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
PRO.31.26	And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
PRO.31.27	She looketh well to the ways of her household,
PRO.31.27	And eateth not the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up, and call her blessed;
PRO.31.28	Her husband 
PRO.31.29	Many daughters have done virtuously,
PRO.31.29	But thou excellest them all.
PRO.31.30	Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain:
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands;
PRO.31.31	And let her works praise her in the gates.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.2	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity. 
ECC.1.3	What profit hath man of all his labour wherein he laboureth under the sun?
ECC.1.4	One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth for ever. 
ECC.1.5	The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he ariseth. 
ECC.1.6	The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. 
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. 
ECC.1.8	All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter 
ECC.1.9	That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 
ECC.1.10	Is there a thing whereof men say, See, this is new? it hath been already, in the ages which were before us. 
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of the former 
ECC.1.12	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. 
ECC.1.15	That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 
ECC.1.16	I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 
ECC.1.17	And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. 
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I SAID in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity. 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 
ECC.2.3	I searched in mine heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, mine heart yet guiding 
ECC.2.4	I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; 
ECC.2.5	I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit: 
ECC.2.6	I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared: 
ECC.2.7	I bought menservants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem: 
ECC.2.8	I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, concubines very many. 
ECC.2.9	So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
ECC.2.10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them: I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labour; and this was my portion from all my labour. 
ECC.2.11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
ECC.2.12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all. 
ECC.2.15	Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also was vanity. 
ECC.2.16	For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been already forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!
ECC.2.17	So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me: for all is vanity and a striving after wind. 
ECC.2.18	And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun: seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 
ECC.2.19	And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity. 
ECC.2.20	Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
ECC.2.22	For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	For all his days are 
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? 
ECC.2.26	For to the man that pleaseth him 
ECC.3.1	To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 
ECC.3.2	a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 
ECC.3.3	a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 
ECC.3.4	a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 
ECC.3.5	a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 
ECC.3.6	a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; 
ECC.3.7	a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 
ECC.3.8	a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. 
ECC.3.9	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
ECC.3.11	He hath made every thing beautiful in its time: also he hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. 
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live. 
ECC.3.13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, is the gift of God. 
ECC.3.14	I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God hath done it, that men should fear before him. 
ECC.3.15	That which is hath been already; and that which is to be hath already been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.
ECC.3.16	And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of judgement, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. 
ECC.3.17	I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
ECC.3.18	I said in mine heart, 
ECC.3.19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity. 
ECC.3.20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
ECC.3.21	Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him 
ECC.4.1	Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter. 
ECC.4.2	Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive; 
ECC.4.3	yea, better than them both 
ECC.4.4	Then I saw all labour and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. 
ECC.4.5	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
ECC.4.6	Better is an handful with quietness, than two handfuls with labour and striving after wind.
ECC.4.7	Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. 
ECC.4.8	There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, 
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth: but how can one be warm 
ECC.4.12	And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. 
ECC.4.14	For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor. 
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living which walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. 
ECC.4.16	There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.5.1	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil. 
ECC.5.2	Be not rash with thy month, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
ECC.5.3	For a dream cometh with a multitude of business; and a fool's voice with a multitude of words.
ECC.5.4	When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest. 
ECC.5.5	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 
ECC.5.6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
ECC.5.7	For 
ECC.5.8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of judgement and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there be higher than they.
ECC.5.9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king 
ECC.5.10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this also is vanity. 
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, saving the beholding 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 
ECC.5.13	There is a grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun, 
ECC.5.14	and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. 
ECC.5.15	As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. 
ECC.5.16	And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboureth for the wind? 
ECC.5.17	All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore vexed and hath sickness and wrath.
ECC.5.18	Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour, wherein he laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion. 
ECC.5.19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. 
ECC.5.20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth 
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men: 
ECC.6.2	a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honour, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. 
ECC.6.3	If a man beget an hundred children and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he: 
ECC.6.4	for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness; 
ECC.6.5	moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath rest rather than the other: 
ECC.6.6	yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good: do not all go to one place?
ECC.6.7	All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. 
ECC.6.8	For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? 
ECC.6.9	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind. 
ECC.6.10	Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago, and it is known that it is man: neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.
ECC.6.11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? 
ECC.6.12	For who knoweth what is good for man in 
ECC.7.1	A 
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad. 
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 
ECC.7.5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.
ECC.7.7	Surely extortion maketh a wise man foolish; and a gift destroyeth the understanding. 
ECC.7.8	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: 
ECC.7.9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 
ECC.7.10	Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance: yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun. 
ECC.7.12	For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it. 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? 
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God hath even made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out any thing 
ECC.7.15	All this have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth 
ECC.7.16	Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
ECC.7.17	Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 
ECC.7.18	It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. 
ECC.7.19	Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers which are in a city. 
ECC.7.20	Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. 
ECC.7.21	Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 
ECC.7.22	for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
ECC.7.23	All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. 
ECC.7.24	That which is is far off, and exceeding deep; who can find it out? 
ECC.7.25	I turned about, and my heart 
ECC.7.26	And I find a thing more bitter than death, 
ECC.7.27	Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher; 
ECC.7.28	which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 
ECC.7.29	Behold, this only have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
ECC.8.1	Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed. 
ECC.8.2	I 
ECC.8.3	Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
ECC.8.4	Because the king's word 
ECC.8.5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man's heart discerneth time and judgement:
ECC.8.6	for to every purpose there is a time and judgement; because the misery of man is great upon him: 
ECC.8.7	for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be? 
ECC.8.8	There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in 
ECC.8.9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: 
ECC.8.10	And withal I saw the wicked buried, and they came 
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and prolong his 
ECC.8.13	but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, 
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be righteous men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. 
ECC.8.15	Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him in his labour 
ECC.8.16	When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 
ECC.8.17	then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
ECC.9.1	For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this; that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them. 
ECC.9.2	All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; 
ECC.9.3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that 
ECC.9.4	For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. 
ECC.9.7	Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works. 
ECC.9.8	Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack ointment. 
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labour wherein thou labourest under the sun. 
ECC.9.10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do 
ECC.9.11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but fame and chance happeneth to them all. 
ECC.9.12	For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so, are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
ECC.9.13	I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me: 
ECC.9.14	There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: 
ECC.9.15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 
ECC.9.16	Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. 
ECC.9.17	The words of the wise 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to send forth a stinking savour: 
ECC.10.2	A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. 
ECC.10.3	Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one 
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding allayeth great offences. 
ECC.10.5	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler: 
ECC.10.6	folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 
ECC.10.8	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him. 
ECC.10.9	Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; 
ECC.10.10	If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. 
ECC.10.11	If the serpent bite before it be charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 
ECC.10.14	A fool also multiplieth words: 
ECC.10.15	The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, for he knoweth not how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 
ECC.10.17	Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 
ECC.10.18	By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. 
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life: and money answereth all things. 
ECC.10.20	Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 
ECC.11.3	If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be. 
ECC.11.4	He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 
ECC.11.5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, 
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
ECC.11.7	Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. 
ECC.11.8	Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement. 
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for youth and the prime of life are vanity.
ECC.12.1	Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, or ever the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; 
ECC.12.2	or ever the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, be darkened, and the clouds return after the rain: 
ECC.12.3	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, 
ECC.12.4	and the door shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; 
ECC.12.5	yea, they shall be afraid of 
ECC.12.6	or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern; 
ECC.12.7	and the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit return unto God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. 
ECC.12.9	And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, 
ECC.12.10	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, 
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are 
ECC.12.12	And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
ECC.12.14	For God shall bring every work into judgement, with every hidden thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.
SNG.1.1	The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:
SNG.1.2	For thy love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance;
SNG.1.3	Thy name is 
SNG.1.3	Therefore do the virgins love thee.
SNG.1.4	Draw me; we will run after thee:
SNG.1.4	The king hath brought me into his chambers:
SNG.1.4	We will be glad and rejoice in thee,
SNG.1.4	We will make mention of thy love more than of wine:
SNG.1.4	Rightly do they love thee.
SNG.1.5	I am black, but comely,
SNG.1.5	O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	As the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	As the curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Look not upon me, because I am swarthy,
SNG.1.6	Because the sun hath scorched me.
SNG.1.6	My mother's sons were incensed against me,
SNG.1.6	They made me keeper of the vineyards;
SNG.1.7	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
SNG.1.7	Where thou feedest 
SNG.1.7	Where thou makest 
SNG.1.7	For why should I be as one that is veiled
SNG.1.7	Beside the flocks of thy companions?
SNG.1.8	If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,
SNG.1.8	Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
SNG.1.8	And feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
SNG.1.9	I have compared thee, O my love,
SNG.1.9	To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
SNG.1.10	Thy cheeks are comely with plaits 
SNG.1.10	Thy neck with strings of jewels.
SNG.1.11	We will make thee plaits of gold
SNG.1.11	With studs of silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king sat at his table,
SNG.1.12	My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	My beloved is unto me 
SNG.1.13	That lieth betwixt my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved is unto me 
SNG.1.14	In the vineyards of En-gedi.
SNG.1.15	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
SNG.1.15	Thine eyes are 
SNG.1.16	Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant:
SNG.1.16	Also our couch is green.
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house are cedars,
SNG.2.1	I am a rose of Sharon,
SNG.2.1	A lily of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	As a lily among thorns,
SNG.2.2	So is my love among the daughters.
SNG.2.3	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
SNG.2.3	So is my beloved among the sons.
SNG.2.3	I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
SNG.2.3	And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banqueting house,
SNG.2.4	And his banner over me was love.
SNG.2.5	Stay ye me with raisins, comfort me with apples:
SNG.2.5	For I am sick of love.
SNG.2.6	His left hand 
SNG.2.6	And his right hand doth embrace me.
SNG.2.7	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	By the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
SNG.2.7	That ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh,
SNG.2.8	Leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
SNG.2.9	Behold, he standeth behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	He looketh in at the windows,
SNG.2.9	He sheweth himself through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spake, and said unto me,
SNG.2.10	Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.11	For, lo, the winter is past,
SNG.2.11	The rain is over and gone;
SNG.2.12	The flowers appear on the earth;
SNG.2.12	The time of the singing 
SNG.2.12	And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
SNG.2.13	The fig tree ripeneth her green figs,
SNG.2.13	And the vines are in blossom,
SNG.2.13	They give forth their fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.14	O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place,
SNG.2.14	Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice:
SNG.2.14	For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
SNG.2.15	Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards;
SNG.2.15	For our vineyards are in blossom.
SNG.2.16	My beloved is mine, and I am his:
SNG.2.16	He feedeth 
SNG.2.17	Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
SNG.2.17	Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart
SNG.2.17	Upon the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth:
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.2	In the streets and in the broad ways,
SNG.3.2	I will seek him whom my soul loveth:
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen that go about the city found me:
SNG.3.4	It was but a little that I passed from them,
SNG.3.4	When I found him whom my soul loveth:
SNG.3.4	I held him, and would not let him go,
SNG.3.4	Until I had brought him into my mother's house,
SNG.3.4	And into the chamber of her that conceived me.
SNG.3.5	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	By the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
SNG.3.5	That ye stir not up, nor awaken love,
SNG.3.5	Until it please.
SNG.3.6	Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
SNG.3.6	Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
SNG.3.6	With all powders of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Behold, it is the litter of Solomon;
SNG.3.7	Threescore mighty men are about it,
SNG.3.7	Of the mighty men of Israel.
SNG.3.8	They all handle the sword, 
SNG.3.8	Every man hath his sword upon his thigh,
SNG.3.8	Because of fear in the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made himself a palanquin
SNG.3.9	Of the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made the pillars thereof of silver,
SNG.3.10	The bottom thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple,
SNG.3.10	The midst thereof being paved with love,
SNG.3.10	From the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon,
SNG.3.11	With the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him in the day of his espousals,
SNG.3.11	And in the day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
SNG.4.1	Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil:
SNG.4.1	Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
SNG.4.1	That lie along the side of mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Thy teeth are like a flock 
SNG.4.2	Which are come up from the washing;
SNG.4.2	Whereof every one hath twins,
SNG.4.2	And none is bereaved among them.
SNG.4.3	Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
SNG.4.3	And thy mouth is comely:
SNG.4.3	Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
SNG.4.3	Behind thy veil.
SNG.4.4	Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
SNG.4.4	Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
SNG.4.4	All the shields of the mighty men.
SNG.4.5	Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe,
SNG.4.5	Which feed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
SNG.4.6	I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
SNG.4.6	And to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	Thou art all fair, my love;
SNG.4.7	And there is no spot in thee.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, 
SNG.4.8	With me from Lebanon:
SNG.4.8	Look from the top of Amana,
SNG.4.8	From the top of Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	From the lions' dens,
SNG.4.8	From the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, 
SNG.4.9	Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
SNG.4.9	With one chain of thy neck.
SNG.4.10	How fair is thy love, my sister, 
SNG.4.10	How much better is thy love than wine!
SNG.4.10	And the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices!
SNG.4.11	Thy lips, 
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk are under thy tongue;
SNG.4.11	And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	A garden shut up is my sister, 
SNG.4.12	A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
SNG.4.13	Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits;
SNG.4.13	Henna with spikenard plants,
SNG.4.14	Spikenard and saffron,
SNG.4.14	Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense;
SNG.4.14	Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
SNG.4.15	A well of living waters,
SNG.4.15	And flowing streams from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south;
SNG.4.16	Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come into his garden,
SNG.4.16	And eat his precious fruits.
SNG.5.1	I am come into my garden, my sister, 
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, O friends;
SNG.5.1	Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
SNG.5.2	I was asleep, but my heart waked:
SNG.5.2	It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, 
SNG.5.2	Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled:
SNG.5.2	For my head is filled with dew,
SNG.5.2	My locks with the drops of the night.
SNG.5.3	I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole 
SNG.5.4	And my heart was moved for him.
SNG.5.5	I rose up to open to my beloved;
SNG.5.5	And my hands dropped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	And my fingers with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	Upon the handles of the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved;
SNG.5.6	But my beloved had withdrawn himself, 
SNG.5.6	My soul had failed me when he spake:
SNG.5.6	I sought him, but I could not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he gave me no answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen that go about the city found me,
SNG.5.7	They smote me, they wounded me;
SNG.5.7	The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.
SNG.5.8	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	That ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
SNG.5.9	What is thy beloved more than 
SNG.5.9	O thou fairest among women?
SNG.5.9	What is thy beloved more than 
SNG.5.9	That thou dost so adjure us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved is white and ruddy,
SNG.5.10	The chiefest among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is 
SNG.5.11	His locks are bushy, 
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks;
SNG.5.12	Washed with milk, 
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs:
SNG.5.13	His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands are 
SNG.5.14	His body is 
SNG.5.15	His legs are 
SNG.5.15	His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is most sweet:
SNG.5.16	Yea, he is altogether lovely.
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
SNG.5.16	O daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Whither is thy beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	O thou fairest among women?
SNG.6.1	Whither hath thy beloved turned him,
SNG.6.1	That we may seek him with thee?
SNG.6.2	My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine:
SNG.6.3	He feedeth 
SNG.6.4	Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah,
SNG.6.4	Comely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	Terrible as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn away thine eyes from me,
SNG.6.5	For they have overcome me.
SNG.6.5	Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
SNG.6.5	That lie along the side of Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes,
SNG.6.6	Which are come up from the washing;
SNG.6.6	Whereof every one hath twins,
SNG.6.6	And none is bereaved among them.
SNG.6.7	Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
SNG.6.7	Behind thy veil.
SNG.6.8	There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines,
SNG.6.8	And virgins without number.
SNG.6.9	My dove, my undefiled, is 
SNG.6.9	She is the only one of her mother;
SNG.6.9	She is the choice one of her that bare her.
SNG.6.9	The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;
SNG.6.10	Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,
SNG.6.10	Fair as the moon,
SNG.6.10	Clear as the sun,
SNG.6.10	Terrible as an army with banners?
SNG.6.11	I went down into the garden of nuts,
SNG.6.11	To see the green plants of the valley,
SNG.6.11	To see whether the vine budded,
SNG.6.12	Or ever I was aware, my soul set me
SNG.6.13	Return, return, O Shulammite;
SNG.6.13	Return, return, that we may look upon thee.
SNG.6.13	Why will ye look upon the Shulammite,
SNG.6.13	As upon the dance of Mahanaim?
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter!
SNG.7.1	The joints of thy thighs are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	The work of the hands of a cunning workman.
SNG.7.2	Thy navel is 
SNG.7.2	Thy belly is 
SNG.7.2	Set about with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Thy two breasts are like two fawns
SNG.7.3	That are twins of a roe.
SNG.7.4	Thy neck is like the tower of ivory;
SNG.7.4	Thine eyes 
SNG.7.4	Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	Which looketh toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Thine head upon thee is like Carmel,
SNG.7.5	And the hair of thine head like purple;
SNG.7.5	The king is held captive in the tresses 
SNG.7.6	How fair and how pleasant art thou,
SNG.7.6	O love, for delights!
SNG.7.7	This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	And thy breasts to clusters 
SNG.7.8	I said, I will climb up into the palm tree,
SNG.7.8	I will take hold of the branches thereof:
SNG.7.8	Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine,
SNG.7.8	And the smell of thy breath like apples;
SNG.7.9	And thy mouth like the best wine,
SNG.7.9	That goeth down smoothly for my beloved,
SNG.7.9	Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.
SNG.7.10	I am my beloved's,
SNG.7.10	And his desire is toward me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;
SNG.7.11	Let us lodge in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us get up early to the vineyards;
SNG.7.12	Let us see whether the vine hath budded, 
SNG.7.12	There will I give thee my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
SNG.7.13	And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old,
SNG.7.13	Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
SNG.8.1	Oh that thou wert as my brother,
SNG.8.1	That sucked the breasts of my mother!
SNG.8.1	Yea, and none would despise me.
SNG.8.2	I would lead thee, 
SNG.8.2	Who would instruct me;
SNG.8.2	I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,
SNG.8.2	Of the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	His left hand 
SNG.8.3	And his right hand should embrace me.
SNG.8.4	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	That ye stir not up, nor awaken love,
SNG.8.4	Until it please.
SNG.8.5	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,
SNG.8.5	Leaning upon her beloved?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I awakened thee:
SNG.8.5	There thy mother was in travail with thee,
SNG.8.5	There was she in travail that brought thee forth.
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
SNG.8.6	For love is strong as death;
SNG.8.6	Jealousy is cruel as the grave:
SNG.8.6	The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,
SNG.8.6	A very flame of the 
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	Neither can the floods drown it:
SNG.8.7	If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
SNG.8.7	He would utterly be contemned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	And she hath no breasts:
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	In the day when she shall be spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she be a wall,
SNG.8.9	We will build upon her a turret of silver:
SNG.8.9	And if she be a door,
SNG.8.9	We will enclose her with boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers 
SNG.8.10	Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
SNG.8.11	He let out the vineyard unto keepers;
SNG.8.11	Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand 
SNG.8.12	My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
SNG.8.12	Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,
SNG.8.12	And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
SNG.8.13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	The companions hearken for thy voice:
SNG.8.13	Cause me to hear it.
SNG.8.14	Make haste, my beloved,
SNG.8.14	And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
SNG.8.14	Upon the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the 
ISA.1.3	The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: 
ISA.1.4	Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly: they have forsaken the 
ISA.1.5	Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; 
ISA.1.7	Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. 
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
ISA.1.9	Except the 
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.11	To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the 
ISA.1.12	When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts? 
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,--I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting. 
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them. 
ISA.1.15	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil: 
ISA.1.17	learn to do well; seek judgement, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. 
ISA.1.18	Come now, and let us reason together, saith the 
ISA.1.19	If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 
ISA.1.20	but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	How is the faithful city become an harlot! she that was full of judgement! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. 
ISA.1.22	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water. 
ISA.1.23	Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. 
ISA.1.24	Therefore saith the Lord, the 
ISA.1.25	and I will turn my hand upon thee, and throughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin: 
ISA.1.26	and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city. 
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed with judgement, and her converts with righteousness. 
ISA.1.28	But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the 
ISA.1.29	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 
ISA.1.30	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. 
ISA.1.31	And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
ISA.2.1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 
ISA.2.2	And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	And many peoples shall go and say, come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.4	And he shall judge between the nations, and shall reprove many peoples: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	For thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be filled 
ISA.2.7	Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots. 
ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made. 
ISA.2.9	And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low; therefore forgive them not.
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.11	The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the 
ISA.2.12	For there shall be a day of the 
ISA.2.13	and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan; 
ISA.2.14	and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up; 
ISA.2.15	and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fenced wall; 
ISA.2.16	and upon all the ships of Tarshish; and upon all pleasant imagery. 
ISA.2.17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low: and the 
ISA.2.18	And the idols shall utterly pass away. 
ISA.2.19	And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.20	In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats; 
ISA.2.21	to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.22	Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?
ISA.3.1	For, behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.3.2	the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the ancient; 
ISA.3.3	the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the skilful enchanter. 
ISA.3.4	And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. 
ISA.3.5	And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. 
ISA.3.6	When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, 
ISA.3.7	in that day shall he lift up 
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the 
ISA.3.9	The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 
ISA.3.10	Say ye of the righteous, that 
ISA.3.11	Woe unto the wicked! 
ISA.3.12	As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. 
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, the 
ISA.3.16	Moreover the 
ISA.3.17	therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents; 
ISA.3.19	the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers; 
ISA.3.20	the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume boxes, and the amulets; 
ISA.3.21	the rings, and the nose jewels; 
ISA.3.22	the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels; 
ISA.3.23	the hand mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils. 
ISA.3.24	And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle a rope; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth: branding instead of beauty. 
ISA.3.25	Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 
ISA.3.26	And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.
ISA.4.1	And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saving, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.
ISA.4.2	In that day shall the branch of the 
ISA.4.3	And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: 
ISA.4.4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgement, and by the spirit of burning. 
ISA.4.5	And the 
ISA.4.6	And there shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.
ISA.5.1	Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: 
ISA.5.2	and he made a trench about it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. 
ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. 
ISA.5.4	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? 
ISA.5.5	And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the fence thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 
ISA.5.6	and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. 
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.8	Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land! 
ISA.5.9	In mine ears 
ISA.5.10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield 
ISA.5.11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them! 
ISA.5.12	And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are 
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity, for lack of knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst. 
ISA.5.14	Therefore hell hath enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend 
ISA.5.15	And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled: 
ISA.5.16	but the 
ISA.5.17	Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.
ISA.5.18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope: 
ISA.5.19	that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! 
ISA.5.20	Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! 
ISA.5.21	Woe unto them that are wise their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! 
ISA.5.22	Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: 
ISA.5.23	which justify the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! 
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.25	Therefore is the anger of the 
ISA.5.26	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: 
ISA.5.27	None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: 
ISA.5.28	whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 
ISA.5.29	their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver. 
ISA.5.30	And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness 
ISA.6.1	In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. 
ISA.6.2	Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. 
ISA.6.3	And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the 
ISA.6.4	And the foundations of the thresholds were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 
ISA.6.7	and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 
ISA.6.8	And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
ISA.6.9	And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. 
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed. 
ISA.6.11	Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, 
ISA.6.12	and the 
ISA.6.13	And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.
ISA.7.1	And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it; but could not prevail against it. 
ISA.7.2	And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind. 
ISA.7.3	Then said the 
ISA.7.4	and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thine heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.5	Because Syria hath counselled evil against thee, Ephraim 
ISA.7.6	Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel: 
ISA.7.7	thus saith the Lord 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin: and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, that it be not a people: 
ISA.7.9	and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
ISA.7.10	And the 
ISA.7.11	Ask thee a sign of the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the 
ISA.7.13	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. 
ISA.7.15	Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.7.19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all pastures. 
ISA.7.20	In that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, 
ISA.7.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; 
ISA.7.22	and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land. 
ISA.7.23	And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall even be for briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.24	With arrows and with bow shall one come thither; because all the land shall be briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	And all the hills that were digged with the mattock; thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.
ISA.8.1	And the 
ISA.8.2	and I will take unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 
ISA.8.3	And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the 
ISA.8.4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria. 
ISA.8.5	And the 
ISA.8.6	Forasmuch as this people hath refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; 
ISA.8.7	now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, 
ISA.8.8	and he shall sweep onward into Judah; he shall overflow and pass through; he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
ISA.8.9	Make an uproar; O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. 
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us. 
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people shall say, A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be in dread 
ISA.8.13	The 
ISA.8.14	And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
ISA.8.15	And many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
ISA.8.16	Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 
ISA.8.17	And I will wait for the 
ISA.8.18	Behold, I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.19	And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living 
ISA.8.20	To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them. 
ISA.8.21	And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward, 
ISA.8.22	and they shall look unto the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and into thick darkness 
ISA.9.1	But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 
ISA.9.2	The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. 
ISA.9.3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. 
ISA.9.4	For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian. 
ISA.9.5	For all the armour of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire. 
ISA.9.6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
ISA.9.7	Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with judgement and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. 
ISA.9.9	And all the people shall know, 
ISA.9.10	The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. 
ISA.9.11	Therefore the 
ISA.9.12	the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind, and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. 
ISA.9.13	Yet the people hath not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore the 
ISA.9.15	The ancient and the honourable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. 
ISA.9.16	For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. 
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, neither shall he have compassion on their fatherless and widows: for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. 
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns: yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in thick clouds of smoke. 
ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the 
ISA.9.20	And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 
ISA.9.21	Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.1	Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write perverseness: 
ISA.10.2	to turn aside the needy from judgement, and to take away the right of the poor of my people, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey! 
ISA.10.3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? 
ISA.10.4	They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.5	Ho Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, the staff in whose hand is mine indignation! 
ISA.10.6	I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 
ISA.10.7	Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few. 
ISA.10.8	For he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings? 
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? 
ISA.10.10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
ISA.10.11	shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? 
ISA.10.12	Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. 
ISA.10.13	For he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and I have brought down as a valiant man them that sit 
ISA.10.14	and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped. 
ISA.10.15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if a rod should shake them that lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up 
ISA.10.16	Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire. 
ISA.10.17	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. 
ISA.10.18	And he shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and it shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth. 
ISA.10.19	And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
ISA.10.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the 
ISA.10.21	A remnant shall return, 
ISA.10.22	For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, 
ISA.10.23	For a consummation, and that determined, shall the Lord, the 
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord, the 
ISA.10.25	For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and mine anger, in their destruction. 
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. 
ISA.10.28	He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage: 
ISA.10.29	they are gone over the pass; they have taken up their lodging at Geba: Ramah trembleth; Gibeah of Saul is fled. 
ISA.10.30	Cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim! hearken, O Laishah! O thou poor Anathoth! 
ISA.10.31	Madmenah is a fugitive; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee. 
ISA.10.32	This very day shall he halt at Nob: he shaketh his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.34	And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
ISA.11.1	And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit: 
ISA.11.2	And the spirit of the 
ISA.11.3	And his delight shall be in the fear of the 
ISA.11.4	but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 
ISA.11.5	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. 
ISA.11.6	And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. 
ISA.11.7	And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
ISA.11.8	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk's den. 
ISA.11.9	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, which standeth for an ensign of the peoples, unto him shall the nations seek; and his resting place shall be glorious. 
ISA.11.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall remain, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
ISA.11.12	And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
ISA.11.13	The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and they that vex Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 
ISA.11.14	And they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines on the west; together shall they spoil the children of the east: they shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. 
ISA.11.15	And the 
ISA.11.16	And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall remain, from Assyria; like as there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	And in that day thou shalt say, I will give thanks unto thee, O 
ISA.12.2	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for the 
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
ISA.12.4	And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks unto the 
ISA.12.5	Sing unto the 
ISA.12.6	Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
ISA.13.1	The burden of which Babylon, Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. 
ISA.13.2	Set ye up an ensign upon the bare mountain, lift up the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 
ISA.13.3	I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my mighty men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones. 
ISA.13.4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people! the noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! the 
ISA.13.5	They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even the 
ISA.13.6	Howl ye; for the day of the 
ISA.13.7	Therefore shall all hands be feeble, and every heart of man shall melt: 
ISA.13.8	and they shall be dismayed; pangs and sorrows shall take hold 
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the 
ISA.13.10	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. 
ISA.13.11	And I will punish the world for 
ISA.13.12	I will make a man more rare than fine gold, even a man than the pure gold of Ophir. 
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth shall be shaken out of her place, in the wrath of the 
ISA.13.14	And it shall come to pass, that as the chased roe, and as sheep that no man gathereth, they shall turn every man to his own people, and shall flee every man to his own land. 
ISA.13.15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is taken shall fall by the sword. 
ISA.13.16	Their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. 
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver, and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. 
ISA.13.18	And 
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 
ISA.13.20	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there. 
ISA.13.21	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. 
ISA.13.22	And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the 
ISA.14.3	And it shall come to pass in the day that the 
ISA.14.4	that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! 
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained. 
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest, 
ISA.14.8	Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, 
ISA.14.9	Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 
ISA.14.10	All they shall answer and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? 
ISA.14.11	Thy pomp is brought down to hell, 
ISA.14.12	How art thou fallen from heaven, O day star, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst lay low the nations! 
ISA.14.13	And thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north: 
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. 
ISA.14.15	Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the uttermost parts of the pit. 
ISA.14.16	They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, they shall consider thee, 
ISA.14.17	that made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities thereof; that let not loose his prisoners to their home? 
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house. 
ISA.14.19	But thou art cast forth away from thy sepulchre like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, that are thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under foot. 
ISA.14.20	Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever. 
ISA.14.21	Prepare ye slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they rise not up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities. 
ISA.14.22	And I will rise up against them, saith the 
ISA.14.23	I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.25	that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder. 
ISA.14.26	This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.28	In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. 
ISA.14.29	Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. 
ISA.14.30	And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain. 
ISA.14.31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou art melted away, O Philistia, all of thee; for there cometh a smoke out of the north, and none standeth aloof at his appointed times. 
ISA.14.32	What then shall one answer the messengers of the nation? That the 
ISA.15.1	The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, 
ISA.15.2	He is gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep: Moab howleth over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off. 
ISA.15.3	In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth: on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one howleth, weeping abundantly. 
ISA.15.4	And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembleth within him. 
ISA.15.5	My heart crieth out for Moab; her nobles 
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the grass is withered away, the tender grass faileth, there is no green thing. 
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows. 
ISA.15.8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim. 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood: for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Sela 
ISA.16.2	For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon. 
ISA.16.3	Give counsel, execute judgement; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday: hide the outcasts; bewray not the wanderer. 
ISA.16.4	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; as for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is brought to nought, spoiling ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. 
ISA.16.5	And a throne shall be established in mercy, and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David; judging, and seeking judgement, and swift to do righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, 
ISA.16.7	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, utterly stricken. 
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice plants thereof; they reached even unto Jazer, they wandered into the wilderness; her branches were spread abroad, they passed over the sea. 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the 
ISA.16.10	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the 
ISA.16.11	Wherefore my bowels sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-heres. 
ISA.16.12	And it shall come to pass, when Moab presenteth himself, when he wearieth himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail. 
ISA.16.13	This is the word that the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. 
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid. 
ISA.17.3	The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria; they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the 
ISA.17.4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean. 
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing corn, and his arm reapeth the ears; yea, it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet there shall be left therein gleanings, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith the 
ISA.17.7	In that day shall a man look unto his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
ISA.17.8	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall he have respect to that which his fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images.
ISA.17.9	In that day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel: and it shall be a desolation. 
ISA.17.10	For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength; therefore thou plantest pleasant plants, and settest it with strange slips: 
ISA.17.11	In the day of thy planting thou hedgest it in, and in the morning thou makest thy seed to blossom: but the harvest fleeth away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
ISA.17.12	Ah, the uproar of many peoples, which roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters! 
ISA.17.13	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but he shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm. 
ISA.17.14	At eventide behold terror; 
ISA.18.1	Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: 
ISA.18.2	that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, 
ISA.18.3	All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye. 
ISA.18.4	For thus hath the 
ISA.18.5	For afore the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he shall cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches shall he take away 
ISA.18.6	They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. 
ISA.18.7	In that time shall a present be brought unto the 
ISA.19.1	The burden of Egypt. Behold, the 
ISA.19.2	And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, 
ISA.19.3	And the spirit of Egypt shall be made void in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards. 
ISA.19.4	And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry. 
ISA.19.6	And the rivers shall stink; the streams of Egypt shall be minished and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither away. 
ISA.19.7	The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all that is sown by the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more. 
ISA.19.8	The fishers also shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. 
ISA.19.9	Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be ashamed. 
ISA.19.10	And her pillars shall be broken in pieces, all they that work for hire 
ISA.19.11	The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 
ISA.19.12	Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner stone of her tribes. 
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do. 
ISA.19.16	It In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt, every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day shall there be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians. 
ISA.19.24	In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth: 
ISA.19.25	for that the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it; 
ISA.20.2	at that time the 
ISA.20.3	And the 
ISA.20.4	so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
ISA.20.5	And they shall be dismayed and ashamed, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant of this coastland shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and we, how shall we escape?
ISA.21.1	The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land. 
ISA.21.2	A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. 
ISA.21.3	Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see. 
ISA.21.4	My heart panteth, horror hath affrighted me: the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me. 
ISA.21.5	They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield. 
ISA.21.6	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth: 
ISA.21.7	and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed. 
ISA.21.8	And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights: 
ISA.21.9	and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground. 
ISA.21.10	O thou my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard from the 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? 
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.
ISA.21.13	The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanites. 
ISA.21.14	Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread. 
ISA.21.15	For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. 
ISA.21.16	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: 
ISA.21.17	and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few: for the 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? 
ISA.22.2	O thou that art full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; thy slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. 
ISA.22.3	All thy rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers: all that were found of thee were bound together, they fled afar off. 
ISA.22.4	Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me, for the spoiling of the daughter of my people. 
ISA.22.5	For it is a day of discomfiture, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, the 
ISA.22.6	And Elam bare the quiver, with chariots of men 
ISA.22.7	And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
ISA.22.8	And he took away the covering of Judah; and thou didst look in that day to the armour in the house of the forest. 
ISA.22.9	And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool, 
ISA.22.10	and ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall, 
ISA.22.11	ye made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye looked not unto him that had done this, neither had ye respect unto him that fashioned it long ago. 
ISA.22.12	And in that day did the Lord, the 
ISA.22.13	and behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. 
ISA.22.14	And the 
ISA.22.15	Thus saith the Lord, the 
ISA.22.16	What doest thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre? hewing him out a sepulchre on high, graving an habitation for himself in the rock! 
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	He will surely turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country; there shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of thy lord's house. 
ISA.22.19	And I will thrust thee from thine office, and from thy station shall he pull thee down. 
ISA.22.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
ISA.22.21	and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 
ISA.22.23	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father's house. 
ISA.22.24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons. 
ISA.22.25	In that day, saith the 
ISA.23.1	The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them. 
ISA.23.2	Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished. 
ISA.23.3	And on great waters the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue; and she was the mart of nations. 
ISA.23.4	Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, the strong hold of the sea; saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins. 
ISA.23.5	When the report cometh to Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre. 
ISA.23.6	Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. 
ISA.23.7	Is this your joyous 
ISA.23.8	Who hath purposed this against Tyre, the crowning 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Pass through thy land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no girdle 
ISA.23.11	He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, he hath shaken the kingdoms: the 
ISA.23.12	And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Kittim; even there shalt thou have no rest. 
ISA.23.13	Behold, the land of the Chaldeans; this people is no more; the Assyrian hath appointed it for the beasts of the wilderness: they set up their towers, they overthrew the palaces thereof; he made it a ruin. 
ISA.23.14	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strong hold is laid waste.
ISA.23.15	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it shall be unto Tyre as in the song of the harlot. 
ISA.23.16	Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. 
ISA.23.17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the 
ISA.23.18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. 
ISA.24.3	The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the lofty people of the earth do languish. 
ISA.24.5	The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof'; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. 
ISA.24.6	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are found guilty: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. 
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh. 
ISA.24.8	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. 
ISA.24.9	They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. 
ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in. 
ISA.24.11	There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. 
ISA.24.12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
ISA.24.13	For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the grape gleanings when the vintage is done. 
ISA.24.14	These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Wherefore glorify ye the 
ISA.24.16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. 
ISA.24.17	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. 
ISA.24.18	And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth do shake. 
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. 
ISA.24.20	The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall be moved to and fro like a hut; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again. 
ISA.24.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.24.22	And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. 
ISA.24.23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the 
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.2	For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. 
ISA.25.3	Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. 
ISA.25.4	For thou hast been a strong hold to the poor, a strong hold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. 
ISA.25.5	As the heat in a dry place shalt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
ISA.25.6	And in this mountain shall the 
ISA.25.7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that is cast over all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. 
ISA.25.8	He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord 
ISA.25.9	And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the 
ISA.25.10	For in this mountain shall the hand of the 
ISA.25.11	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth 
ISA.25.12	And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks. 
ISA.26.2	Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth truth may enter in. 
ISA.26.3	Thou wilt keep 
ISA.26.4	Trust ye in the 
ISA.26.5	For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. 
ISA.26.6	The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. 
ISA.26.7	The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art up right dost direct the path of the just. 
ISA.26.8	Yea, in the way of thy judgements, O 
ISA.26.9	With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 
ISA.26.10	Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see 
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.14	 dead, they shall not live; 
ISA.26.15	Thou hast increased the nation, O 
ISA.26.16	, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer 
ISA.26.17	Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been before thee, O 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 
ISA.26.19	Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is 
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. 
ISA.26.21	For, behold, the 
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	In that day: A vineyard of wine, sing ye unto it. 
ISA.27.3	I the 
ISA.27.4	Fury is not in me: would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march upon them, I would burn them together. 
ISA.27.5	Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; 
ISA.27.6	In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud: and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by him? 
ISA.27.8	In measure, when thou sendest her away, thou dost contend with her; he hath removed 
ISA.27.9	Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, 
ISA.27.10	For the defenced city is solitary, an habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof. 
ISA.27.11	When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour. 
ISA.27.12	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.27.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship the 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcome with wine! 
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, shall he cast down to the earth with the hand. 
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot: 
ISA.28.4	and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the firstripe fig before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up. 
ISA.28.5	In that day shall the 
ISA.28.6	and for a spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement, and for strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate. 
ISA.28.7	But these also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are gone astray; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are gone astray through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgement. 
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit 
ISA.28.9	Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? 
ISA.28.10	For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little. 
ISA.28.11	Nay, but by 
ISA.28.12	to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear. 
ISA.28.13	Therefore shall the word of the 
ISA.28.14	Wherefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.15	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves: 
ISA.28.16	therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.28.17	And I will make judgement the line, and righteousness the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. 
ISA.28.18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. 
ISA.28.19	As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message. 
ISA.28.20	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. 
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.22	Now therefore be ye not scorners, lest your bands be made strong: for a consummation, and that determined, have I heard from the Lord, the 
ISA.28.23	Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. 
ISA.28.24	Doth the plowman plow continually to sow? doth he 
ISA.28.25	When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place and the spelt in the border thereof? 
ISA.28.26	For his God doth instruct him aright, 
ISA.28.27	For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp 
ISA.28.28	Bread 
ISA.28.29	This also cometh forth from the 
ISA.29.1	Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round: 
ISA.29.2	then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation: and she shall be unto me as Ariel. 
ISA.29.3	And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a fort, and I will raise siege works against thee. 
ISA.29.4	And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. 
ISA.29.5	But the multitude of they foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. 
ISA.29.6	She shall be visited of the 
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her strong hold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night. 
ISA.29.8	And it shall be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Tarry ye and wonder, take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.11	And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed: 
ISA.29.12	and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. 
ISA.29.13	And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh 
ISA.29.14	therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. 
ISA.29.15	Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
ISA.29.16	Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be counted as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing framed say of him that framed it, He hath no understanding?
ISA.29.17	Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be counted for a forest? 
ISA.29.18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness. 
ISA.29.19	The meek also shall increase their joy in the 
ISA.29.20	For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off: 
ISA.29.21	that make a man an offender in a cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought. 
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.29.23	But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel. 
ISA.29.24	They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall learn doctrine.
ISA.30.1	Woe to the rebellious children, saith the 
ISA.30.2	that walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! 
ISA.30.3	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. 
ISA.30.4	For his princes are at Zoan, and his ambassadors are come to Hanes. 
ISA.30.5	They shall all be ashamed of a people that cannot profit them, that are not an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. 
ISA.30.6	The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit 
ISA.30.7	For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth still.
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever. 
ISA.30.9	For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the 
ISA.30.10	which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: 
ISA.30.11	get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. 
ISA.30.12	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon; 
ISA.30.13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. 
ISA.30.14	And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the cistern. 
ISA.30.15	For thus said the Lord 
ISA.30.16	but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. 
ISA.30.17	One thousand 
ISA.30.18	And therefore will the 
ISA.30.19	For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee. 
ISA.30.20	And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: 
ISA.30.21	and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left. 
ISA.30.22	And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence. 
ISA.30.23	And he shall give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures, 
ISA.30.24	the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savoury provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. 
ISA.30.25	And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers 
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the 
ISA.30.28	and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and a bridle that causeth to err 
ISA.30.29	Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the 
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.31	For through the voice of the 
ISA.30.32	And every stroke of the appointed staff, which the 
ISA.30.33	For a Topheth is prepared of old; yea, for the king it is made ready; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the 
ISA.31.1	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and stay on horses; and trust in chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the 
ISA.31.2	Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. 
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when the 
ISA.31.4	For thus saith the 
ISA.31.5	As birds flying, so will the 
ISA.31.6	Turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O children of Israel. 
ISA.31.7	For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. 
ISA.31.8	Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him: and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary. 
ISA.31.9	And his rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, saith the 
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgement. 
ISA.32.2	And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
ISA.32.3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. 
ISA.32.4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. 
ISA.32.5	The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful. 
ISA.32.6	For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against the 
ISA.32.7	The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right. 
ISA.32.8	But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and in liberal things shall he continue.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, ye women that are at ease, 
ISA.32.10	For days beyond a year shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come. 
ISA.32.11	Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird 
ISA.32.12	They shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 
ISA.32.13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: 
ISA.32.14	For the palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks; 
ISA.32.15	until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. 
ISA.32.16	Then judgement shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field. 
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and confidence for ever. 
ISA.32.18	And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. 
ISA.32.19	But it shall hail, in the downfall of the forest; and the city shall be utterly laid low. 
ISA.32.20	Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass.
ISA.33.1	Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou hast made an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. 
ISA.33.2	O 
ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered. 
ISA.33.4	And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpiller gathereth: as locusts leap shall they leap upon it. 
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.6	And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. 
ISA.33.8	The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man. 
ISA.33.9	The land mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and withereth away: Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off 
ISA.33.10	How will I arise, saith the 
ISA.33.11	Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you. 
ISA.33.12	And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
ISA.33.13	Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. 
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath surprised the godless ones. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 
ISA.33.15	He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil; 
ISA.33.16	He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: his bread shall be given 
ISA.33.17	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a far stretching land. 
ISA.33.18	Thine heart shall muse on the terror: where is he that counted, where is he that weighed 
ISA.33.19	Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive; of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand. 
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 
ISA.33.21	But there the 
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.23	Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey. 
ISA.33.24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
ISA.34.1	Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth of it 
ISA.34.2	For the 
ISA.34.3	Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stink of their carcases shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. 
ISA.34.4	And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading 
ISA.34.5	For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgement. 
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.7	And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. 
ISA.34.8	For it is the day of the 
ISA.34.9	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. 
ISA.34.10	It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. 
ISA.34.11	But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he shall stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness. 
ISA.34.12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all her princes shall be nothing. 
ISA.34.13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches. 
ISA.34.14	And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest. 
ISA.34.15	There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate. 
ISA.34.16	Seek ye out of the book of the 
ISA.34.17	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. 
ISA.35.2	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of the 
ISA.35.3	Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. 
ISA.35.4	Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come 
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. 
ISA.35.6	Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. 
ISA.35.7	And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. 
ISA.35.8	And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err 
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon, they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk 
ISA.35.10	and the ransomed of the 
ISA.36.1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them. 
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. 
ISA.36.3	Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. 
ISA.36.4	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, what confidence is this wherein thou trustest? 
ISA.36.5	I say, 
ISA.36.6	Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him. 
ISA.36.7	But if thou say unto me, We trust in the 
ISA.36.8	Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
ISA.36.9	How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
ISA.36.10	And am I now come up without the 
ISA.36.11	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. 
ISA.36.12	But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? 
ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
ISA.36.14	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he shall not be able to deliver you: 
ISA.36.15	neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
ISA.36.16	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern: 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a laud like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
ISA.36.18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
ISA.36.20	Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the 
ISA.36.21	But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
ISA.36.22	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
ISA.37.1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 
ISA.37.4	It may be the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
ISA.37.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
ISA.37.8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
ISA.37.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
ISA.37.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar? 
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? 
ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed unto the 
ISA.37.16	O 
ISA.37.17	Incline thine ear, O 
ISA.37.18	Of a truth, 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. 
ISA.37.20	Now therefore, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.22	this is the word which the 
ISA.37.23	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? 
ISA.37.24	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into his farthest height, the forest of his fruitful field. 
ISA.37.25	I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt. 
ISA.37.26	Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. 
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field 
ISA.37.28	But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me. 
ISA.37.29	Because of thy raging against me, and for that thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 
ISA.37.30	And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 
ISA.37.31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
ISA.37.32	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of the 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the 
ISA.37.35	For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 
ISA.37.36	And the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
ISA.38.1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the 
ISA.38.3	and said, Remember now, O 
ISA.38.4	Then came the word of the 
ISA.38.5	Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city. 
ISA.38.7	And this shall he the sign unto thee from the 
ISA.38.8	behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.
ISA.38.9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness. 
ISA.38.10	I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. 
ISA.38.11	I said, I shall not see the 
ISA.38.12	Mine age is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd's tent: I have rolled up like a weaver my life; he will cut me off from the loom: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. 
ISA.38.13	I quieted 
ISA.38.14	Like a swallow 
ISA.38.15	What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. 
ISA.38.16	O Lord, by these things men live, and wholly therein is the life of my spirit: wherefore recover thou me, and make me to live. 
ISA.38.17	Behold, 
ISA.38.18	For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. 
ISA.38.19	The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. 
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover. 
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the 
ISA.39.1	At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. 
ISA.39.2	And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. 
ISA.39.3	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon. 
ISA.39.4	Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
ISA.39.5	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the 
ISA.39.7	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
ISA.39.8	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the 
ISA.40.1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 
ISA.40.2	Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned; that she hath received of the 
ISA.40.3	The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of the 
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 
ISA.40.5	and the glory of the 
ISA.40.6	The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: 
ISA.40.7	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the 
ISA.40.8	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
ISA.40.9	O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain: O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God! 
ISA.40.10	Behold, the Lord 
ISA.40.11	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, 
ISA.40.12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 
ISA.40.13	Who hath directed the spirit of the 
ISA.40.14	With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgement, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? 
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. 
ISA.40.16	And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. 
ISA.40.17	All the nations are as nothing before him; they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
ISA.40.18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? 
ISA.40.19	The graven image, a workman melted 
ISA.40.20	He that is too impoverished for 
ISA.40.21	Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
ISA.40.22	 he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: 
ISA.40.23	that bringeth princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. 
ISA.40.24	Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble. 
ISA.40.25	To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal 
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.
ISA.40.27	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the 
ISA.40.28	Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the everlasting God, the 
ISA.40.29	He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength. 
ISA.40.30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: 
ISA.40.31	but they that wait upon the 
ISA.41.1	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the peoples renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgement. 
ISA.41.2	Who hath raised up one from the east, whom he calleth in righteousness to his foot? he giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; he giveth them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow. 
ISA.41.3	He pursueth them, and passeth on safely; even by a way that he had not gone with his feet. 
ISA.41.4	Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the 
ISA.41.5	The isles saw, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled: they drew near, and came. 
ISA.41.6	They helped every one his neighbour; and 
ISA.41.7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved. 
ISA.41.8	But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend; 
ISA.41.9	thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the corners thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away;
ISA.41.10	Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. 
ISA.41.11	Behold, all they that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish. 
ISA.41.12	Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contend with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. 
ISA.41.13	For I the 
ISA.41.14	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the 
ISA.41.15	Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff. 
ISA.41.16	Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the 
ISA.41.17	The poor and needy seek water and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I the 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. 
ISA.41.19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together: 
ISA.41.20	that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the 
ISA.41.21	Produce your cause, saith the 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring them forth, and declare unto us what shall happen: declare ye the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or shew us things for to come. 
ISA.41.23	Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together. 
ISA.41.24	Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you. 
ISA.41.25	I have raised up one from the north, and he is come; from the rising of the sun one that calleth upon my name: and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay. 
ISA.41.26	Who hath declared it from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, 
ISA.41.27	 first 
ISA.41.28	And when I look, there is no man; even among them there is no counsellor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word. 
ISA.41.29	Behold, all of them, their works are vanity 
ISA.42.1	Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles. 
ISA.42.2	He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. 
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgement in truth. 
ISA.42.4	He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgement in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.
ISA.42.5	Thus saith God the 
ISA.42.6	I the 
ISA.42.7	to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. 
ISA.42.8	I am the 
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them. 
ISA.42.10	Sing unto the 
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up 
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory unto the 
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.14	I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: 
ISA.42.15	I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools. 
ISA.42.16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them. 
ISA.42.17	They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods.
ISA.42.18	Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. 
ISA.42.19	Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace 
ISA.42.20	Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not. 
ISA.42.21	It pleased the 
ISA.42.22	But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. 
ISA.42.23	Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come? 
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the 
ISA.42.25	Therefore he poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
ISA.43.1	But now thus saith the 
ISA.43.2	When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. 
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.4	Since thou hast been precious in my sight, 
ISA.43.5	Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; 
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth; 
ISA.43.7	every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory; I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
ISA.43.8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. 
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. 
ISA.43.10	Ye are my witnesses, saith the 
ISA.43.11	I, even I, am the 
ISA.43.12	I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shewed, and there was no strange 
ISA.43.13	Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
ISA.43.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.16	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.17	which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as flax: 
ISA.43.18	Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. 
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. 
ISA.43.20	The beasts of the field shall honour me, the jackals and the ostriches: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen: 
ISA.43.21	the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.
ISA.43.22	Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. 
ISA.43.23	Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not made thee to serve with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense. 
ISA.43.24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. 
ISA.43.25	I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins. 
ISA.43.26	Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth 
ISA.43.27	Thy first father sinned, and thine interpreters have transgressed against me. 
ISA.43.28	Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary, and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.
ISA.44.1	Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen: 
ISA.44.2	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: 
ISA.44.4	and they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses. 
ISA.44.5	One shall say, I am the 
ISA.44.6	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare. 
ISA.44.8	Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have I not declared unto thee of old, and shewed it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.
ISA.44.9	They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit: and their own witnesses see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. 
ISA.44.10	Who hath fashioned a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing? 
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together. 
ISA.44.12	The smith 
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he shapeth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and shapeth it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house. 
ISA.44.14	He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the holm tree and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest: he planteth a fir tree, and the rain doth nourish it. 
ISA.44.15	Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto. 
ISA.44.16	He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 
ISA.44.17	And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. 
ISA.44.18	They know not, neither do they consider: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand. 
ISA.44.19	And none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? 
ISA.44.20	He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, O Jacob; and Israel, for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. 
ISA.44.22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. 
ISA.44.23	Sing, O ye heavens, for the 
ISA.44.24	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.25	that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish: 
ISA.44.26	that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof: 
ISA.44.27	that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 
ISA.44.28	That saith of Cyrus, 
ISA.45.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.2	I will go before thee, and make the rugged places plain: I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 
ISA.45.3	and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the 
ISA.45.4	For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.6	that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me: I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am the 
ISA.45.8	Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, that they may bring forth salvation, and let her cause righteousness to spring up together; I the 
ISA.45.9	Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 
ISA.45.10	Woe unto him that saith unto a father, What begettest thou? or to a woman, with what travailest thou?
ISA.45.11	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. 
ISA.45.13	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith the 
ISA.45.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.15	Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour. 
ISA.45.16	They shall be ashamed, yea, confounded, all of them: they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols. 
ISA.45.17	 Israel shall be saved by the 
ISA.45.18	For thus saith the 
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the 
ISA.45.20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save. 
ISA.45.21	Declare ye, and bring 
ISA.45.22	Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. 
ISA.45.23	By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth 
ISA.45.24	Only in the 
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.46.1	Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary 
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. 
ISA.46.3	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which have been borne 
ISA.46.4	and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry 
ISA.46.5	To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? 
ISA.46.6	Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship. 
ISA.46.7	They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 
ISA.46.8	Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. 
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; 
ISA.46.10	declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not 
ISA.46.11	calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it. 
ISA.46.12	Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness: 
ISA.46.13	I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory,
ISA.47.1	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. 
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones, and grind meal: remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers. 
ISA.47.3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will accept no man. 
ISA.47.4	Our redeemer, the 
ISA.47.5	Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdoms. 
ISA.47.6	I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
ISA.47.7	And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof. 
ISA.47.8	Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and there is none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: 
ISA.47.9	but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: in their full measure shall they come upon thee, despite of the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments. 
ISA.47.10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee: and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and there is none else beside me. 
ISA.47.11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not. 
ISA.47.12	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 
ISA.47.13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee. 
ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before. 
ISA.47.15	Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast laboured: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee.
ISA.48.1	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; which swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; the 
ISA.48.3	I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass. 
ISA.48.4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; 
ISA.48.5	therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. 
ISA.48.6	Thou hast heard it; behold all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known. 
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. 
ISA.48.8	Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
ISA.48.9	For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. 
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. 
ISA.48.11	For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should 
ISA.48.12	Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. 
ISA.48.13	Yea, mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together. 
ISA.48.14	Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The 
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
ISA.48.16	Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord 
ISA.48.17	Thus saith the 
ISA.48.18	Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 
ISA.48.19	thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name should not be cut off nor destroyed from before me. 
ISA.48.20	Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, The 
ISA.48.21	And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out. 
ISA.48.22	There is no peace, saith the 
ISA.49.1	Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye peoples, from far: the 
ISA.49.2	and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me; and he hath made me a polished shaft, in his quiver hath he kept me close: 
ISA.49.3	and he said unto me, Thou art my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified. 
ISA.49.4	But I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and vanity: yet surely my judgement is with the 
ISA.49.5	And now saith the 
ISA.49.6	yea, he saith, It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
ISA.49.7	Thus saith the 
ISA.49.8	Thus saith the 
ISA.49.9	saying to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture. 
ISA.49.10	They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. 
ISA.49.11	And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted. 
ISA.49.12	Lo, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
ISA.49.13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the 
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me. 
ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, these may forget, yet will not I forget thee. 
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. 
ISA.49.17	Thy children make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
ISA.49.18	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the 
ISA.49.19	For, as for thy waste and thy desolate places and thy land that hath been destroyed, surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away. 
ISA.49.20	The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell. 
ISA.49.21	Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they? 
ISA.49.22	Thus saith the Lord 
ISA.49.23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the 
ISA.49.24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered? 
ISA.49.25	But thus saith the 
ISA.49.26	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the 
ISA.50.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.50.2	Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst. 
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
ISA.50.4	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. 
ISA.50.7	For the Lord 
ISA.50.8	He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand up together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me. 
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord 
ISA.50.10	Who is among you that feareth the 
ISA.50.11	Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands: walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
ISA.51.1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the 
ISA.51.2	Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many. 
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.4	Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will make my judgement to rest for a light of the peoples. 
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust. 
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. 
ISA.51.7	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings. 
ISA.51.8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations.
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the 
ISA.51.10	Art thou not it which dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over? 
ISA.51.11	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.51.12	I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; 
ISA.51.13	and hast forgotten the 
ISA.51.14	The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die 
ISA.51.15	For I am the 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the 
ISA.51.18	There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up. 
ISA.51.19	These two things are befallen thee; who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee? 
ISA.51.20	Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the top of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the fury of the 
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: 
ISA.51.22	Thus saith thy Lord the 
ISA.51.23	and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over.
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. 
ISA.52.2	Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit thee down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion, 
ISA.52.3	For thus saith the 
ISA.52.4	For thus saith the Lord 
ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what do I here, saith the 
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore 
ISA.52.7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! 
ISA.52.8	The voice of thy watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see, eye to eye, when the 
ISA.52.9	Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the 
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.11	Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of the 
ISA.52.12	For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight: for the 
ISA.52.13	Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high. 
ISA.52.14	Like as many were astonied at thee, (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men,) 
ISA.52.15	so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.
ISA.53.1	Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. 
ISA.53.3	He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
ISA.53.4	Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 
ISA.53.5	But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed, yet he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb; yea, he opened not his mouth. 
ISA.53.8	By oppression and judgement he was taken away; and as for his generation, who 
ISA.53.9	And they made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his month.
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see of the travail of his soul, 
ISA.53.12	Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the 
ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. 
ISA.54.3	For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. 
ISA.54.4	Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more. 
ISA.54.5	For thy Maker is thine husband; the 
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.7	For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. 
ISA.54.8	In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the 
ISA.54.9	For this is 
ISA.54.10	For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith the 
ISA.54.11	O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. 
ISA.54.12	And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of pleasant stones. 
ISA.54.13	And all thy children shall be taught of the 
ISA.54.14	In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee. 
ISA.54.15	Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee. 
ISA.54.16	Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. 
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgement thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the 
ISA.55.1	Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. 
ISA.55.2	Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. 
ISA.55.3	Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. 
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples. 
ISA.55.5	Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of the 
ISA.55.6	Seek ye the 
ISA.55.7	let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the 
ISA.55.8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the 
ISA.55.9	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
ISA.55.10	For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater; 
ISA.55.11	so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. 
ISA.55.12	For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. 
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the 
ISA.56.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that holdeth fast by it; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
ISA.56.3	Neither let the stranger, that hath joined himself to the 
ISA.56.4	For thus saith the 
ISA.56.5	Unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. 
ISA.56.6	Also the strangers, that join themselves to the 
ISA.56.7	even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar: for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all peoples. 
ISA.56.8	The Lord 
ISA.56.9	All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, 
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber. 
ISA.56.11	Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter. 
ISA.56.12	Come ye, 
ISA.57.1	The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil 
ISA.57.2	He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.
ISA.57.3	But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore. 
ISA.57.4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, 
ISA.57.5	ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks? 
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth 
ISA.57.7	Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed: thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. 
ISA.57.8	And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast discovered 
ISA.57.9	And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell. 
ISA.57.10	Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint. 
ISA.57.11	And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and fearest me not? 
ISA.57.12	I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.
ISA.57.13	When thou criest, let them which thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain. 
ISA.57.14	And he shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people. 
ISA.57.15	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
ISA.57.17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him, I hid 
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 
ISA.57.19	I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt. 
ISA.57.21	There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
ISA.58.1	Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins. 
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous ordinances, they delight to draw near unto God.
ISA.58.3	Wherefore have we fasted, 
ISA.58.4	Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high. 
ISA.58.5	Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the 
ISA.58.6	Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? 
ISA.58.7	Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
ISA.58.8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then shalt thou call, and the 
ISA.58.10	and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday: 
ISA.58.11	and the 
ISA.58.12	And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
ISA.58.13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, 
ISA.58.14	then shalt thou delight thyself in the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.2	but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. 
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness. 
ISA.59.4	None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. 
ISA.59.5	They hatch basilisks' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. 
ISA.59.6	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. 
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation ard destruction are in their paths. 
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgement in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore is judgement far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but behold darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity. 
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind, yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men. 
ISA.59.11	We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgement, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. 
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them: 
ISA.59.13	in transgressing and denying the 
ISA.59.14	And judgement is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter. 
ISA.59.15	Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the 
ISA.59.16	And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him. 
ISA.59.17	And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. 
ISA.59.18	According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. 
ISA.59.19	So shall they fear the name of the 
ISA.59.20	And a redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the 
ISA.59.21	And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples: but the 
ISA.60.3	And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. 
ISA.60.4	Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms. 
ISA.60.5	Then thou shalt see and be lightened, and thine heart shall tremble and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee. 
ISA.60.6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; they all shall come from Sheba: they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. 
ISA.60.8	Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
ISA.60.9	Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of the 
ISA.60.10	And strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee. 
ISA.60.11	Thy gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations; and their kings led 
ISA.60.12	For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. 
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together; to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious. 
ISA.60.14	And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The city of the 
ISA.60.15	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. 
ISA.60.16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the 
ISA.60.17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. 
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. 
ISA.60.19	The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the 
ISA.60.20	Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the 
ISA.60.21	Thy people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever; the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. 
ISA.60.22	The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation: I the 
ISA.61.1	The spirit of the Lord 
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the acceptable year of the 
ISA.61.3	to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the 
ISA.61.4	And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. 
ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. 
ISA.61.6	But ye shall be named the priests of the 
ISA.61.7	For your shame 
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.9	And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the 
ISA.61.10	I will greatly rejoice in the 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
ISA.62.1	For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. 
ISA.62.2	And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the 
ISA.62.3	Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the 
ISA.62.4	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the 
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are the 
ISA.62.7	and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.9	but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise the 
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples. 
ISA.62.11	Behold, the 
ISA.62.12	And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of the 
ISA.63.1	Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 
ISA.63.2	Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 
ISA.63.3	I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my fury; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment. 
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance was in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. 
ISA.63.5	And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. 
ISA.63.6	And I trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my fury, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.
ISA.63.7	I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the 
ISA.63.8	For he said, Surely, they are my people, children that will not deal falsely: so he was their saviour. 
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. 
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled, and grieved his holy spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, 
ISA.63.11	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, 
ISA.63.12	that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? that divided the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? 
ISA.63.13	that led them through the depths, as an horse in the wilderness, that they stumbled not? 
ISA.63.14	As the cattle that go down into the valley, the spirit of the 
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy mighty acts? the yearning of thy bowels and thy compassions are restrained toward me. 
ISA.63.16	For thou art our father, though Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us: thou, O 
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.18	Thy holy people possessed 
ISA.63.19	We are become as they over whom thou never barest rule; as they that were not called by thy name.
ISA.64.1	Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence; 
ISA.64.2	as when fire kindleth the brushwood, 
ISA.64.3	When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 
ISA.64.4	For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee, which worketh for him that waiteth for him. 
ISA.64.5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them 
ISA.64.6	For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. 
ISA.64.7	And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities. 
ISA.64.8	But now, O 
ISA.64.9	Be not wroth very sore, O 
ISA.64.10	Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
ISA.64.11	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 
ISA.64.12	Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O 
ISA.65.1	I AM inquired of by them that asked not 
ISA.65.2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; 
ISA.65.3	a people that provoketh me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks; 
ISA.65.4	which sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; 
ISA.65.5	which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. 
ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom, 
ISA.65.7	your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the 
ISA.65.8	Thus saith the 
ISA.65.9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. 
ISA.65.10	And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
ISA.65.11	But ye that forsake the 
ISA.65.12	I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not. 
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.65.14	behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. 
ISA.65.15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen, and the Lord 
ISA.65.16	so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
ISA.65.17	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
ISA.65.18	But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 
ISA.65.19	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
ISA.65.20	There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old, and the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed. 
ISA.65.21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
ISA.65.22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 
ISA.65.23	They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of the 
ISA.65.24	And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the 
ISA.66.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.66.2	For all these things hath mine hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith the 
ISA.66.3	He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, 
ISA.66.4	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.6	A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the 
ISA.66.7	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. 
ISA.66.8	Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. 
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her: 
ISA.66.11	that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. 
ISA.66.12	For thus saith the 
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 
ISA.66.14	And ye shall see 
ISA.66.15	For, behold, the 
ISA.66.16	For by fire will the 
ISA.66.17	They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves 
ISA.66.18	For I 
ISA.66.19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations. 
ISA.66.20	And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the 
ISA.66.21	And of them also will I take for priests 
ISA.66.22	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the 
ISA.66.23	And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the 
ISA.66.24	And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
JER.1.2	to whom the word of the 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah; unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
JER.1.4	Now the word of the 
JER.1.5	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations. 
JER.1.6	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Be not afraid because of them: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, and to destroy and to overthrow; to build, and to plant.
JER.1.11	Moreover the word of the 
JER.1.12	Then said the 
JER.1.13	And the word of the 
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the 
JER.1.16	And I will utter my judgements against them touching all their wickedness; in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. 
JER.1.17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them. 
JER.1.18	For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. 
JER.1.19	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith the 
JER.2.1	And the word of the 
JER.2.2	Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.2.3	Israel 
JER.2.4	Hear ye the word of the 
JER.2.5	thus saith the 
JER.2.6	Neither said they, Where is the 
JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination. 
JER.2.8	The priests said not, Where is the 
JER.2.9	Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the 
JER.2.10	For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing. 
JER.2.11	Hath a nation changed 
JER.2.12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the 
JER.2.13	For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
JER.2.14	Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn 
JER.2.15	The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled: and they have made his land waste; his cities are burned up, without inhabitant. 
JER.2.16	The children also of Noph and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head. 
JER.2.17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.18	And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? 
JER.2.19	Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.20	For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou didst bow thyself, playing the harlot. 
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? 
JER.2.22	For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord 
JER.2.23	How canst thou say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: 
JER.2.24	a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. 
JER.2.25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go. 
JER.2.26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; 
JER.2.27	which say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. 
JER.2.28	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
JER.2.29	Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the 
JER.2.30	In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. 
JER.2.31	O generation, see ye the word of the 
JER.2.32	Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. 
JER.2.33	How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways. 
JER.2.34	Also, in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: I have not found it at the place of breaking in, but upon all these. 
JER.2.35	Yet thou saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgement with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned. 
JER.2.36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 
JER.2.37	From him also shalt thou go forth, with thine hands upon thine head: for the 
JER.3.1	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the 
JER.3.2	Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. 
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. 
JER.3.4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth? 
JER.3.5	Will he retain 
JER.3.6	Moreover the 
JER.3.7	And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 
JER.3.8	And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot. 
JER.3.9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks. 
JER.3.10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the 
JER.3.11	And the 
JER.3.12	Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the 
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the 
JER.3.14	Return, O backsliding children, saith the 
JER.3.15	and I will give you shepherds according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the 
JER.3.17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers. 
JER.3.19	But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations? and I said, Ye shall call me My father; and shall not turn away from following me.
JER.3.20	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the 
JER.3.21	A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping 
JER.3.22	Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings, Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art the 
JER.3.23	Truly in vain is 
JER.3.24	But the shameful thing hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us: for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the 
JER.4.2	and thou shalt swear, As the 
JER.4.3	For thus saith the 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.5	Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say? Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fenced cities. 
JER.4.6	Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. 
JER.4.7	A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place; to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. 
JER.4.8	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.9	And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the 
JER.4.10	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.4.11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse; 
JER.4.12	a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgements against them. 
JER.4.13	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots 
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee? 
JER.4.15	For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim: 
JER.4.16	make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, 
JER.4.17	As keepers of a field are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the 
JER.4.18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thine heart.
JER.4.19	My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
JER.4.20	Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, 
JER.4.21	How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? 
JER.4.22	For my people is foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. 
JER.4.23	I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. 
JER.4.24	I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro. 
JER.4.25	I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. 
JER.4.26	I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the 
JER.4.27	For thus saith the 
JER.4.28	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it. 
JER.4.29	The whole city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein. 
JER.4.30	And thou, when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair; 
JER.4.31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, 
JER.5.1	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her. 
JER.5.2	And though they say, As the 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.4	Then I said, Surely these are poor: they are foolish; for they know not the way of the 
JER.5.5	I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of the 
JER.5.6	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities, every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, 
JER.5.7	How can I pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots' houses. 
JER.5.8	They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife, 
JER.5.9	shall I not visit for these things? saith the 
JER.5.10	Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches: for they are not the 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the 
JER.5.12	They have denied the 
JER.5.13	and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them. 
JER.5.14	Wherefore thus saith the 
JER.5.15	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the 
JER.5.16	Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. 
JER.5.17	And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread, 
JER.5.18	But even in those days, saith the 
JER.5.19	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath the 
JER.5.20	Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
JER.5.21	Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not: 
JER.5.22	Fear ye not me? saith the 
JER.5.23	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. 
JER.5.24	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the 
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you. 
JER.5.26	For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men. 
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. 
JER.5.28	They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness: they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they should prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge, 
JER.5.29	shall I not visit for these things? saith the 
JER.5.30	A wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land; 
JER.5.31	the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
JER.6.1	Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem: for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction. 
JER.6.2	The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off. 
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. 
JER.6.4	Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. 
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces. 
JER.6.6	For thus hath the 
JER.6.7	As a well casteth forth her waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds. 
JER.6.8	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.
JER.6.9	Thus saith the 
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the 
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the 
JER.6.12	And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
JER.6.13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
JER.6.14	They have healed also the hurt of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the 
JER.6.16	Thus saith the 
JER.6.17	And I set watchmen over you, 
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. 
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it. 
JER.6.20	To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me. 
JER.6.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.6.22	Thus saith the 
JER.6.23	They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses; every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion. 
JER.6.24	We have heard the fame thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, 
JER.6.25	Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for 
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. 
JER.6.27	I have made thee a tower 
JER.6.28	They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly. 
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away. 
JER.6.30	Refuse silver shall men call them, because the 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus saith the 
JER.7.4	Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the 
JER.7.5	For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgement between a man and his neighbour; 
JER.7.6	if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt: 
JER.7.7	then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore. 
JER.7.8	Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 
JER.7.9	Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye have not known, 
JER.7.10	and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations. 
JER.7.11	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith the 
JER.7.12	But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. 
JER.7.13	And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the 
JER.7.14	therefore will I do unto the house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
JER.7.16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee. 
JER.7.17	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. 
JER.7.19	Do they provoke me to anger? saith the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
JER.7.21	Thus saith the 
JER.7.22	For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: 
JER.7.23	but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you. 
JER.7.24	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 
JER.7.26	yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers. 
JER.7.27	And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee. 
JER.7.28	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of the 
JER.7.29	Cut off thine hair, 
JER.7.30	For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith the 
JER.7.31	And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind. 
JER.7.32	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.7.33	And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away. 
JER.7.34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride: for the land shall become a waste.
JER.8.1	At that time, saith the 
JER.8.2	and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. 
JER.8.3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the 
JER.8.4	Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.8.5	Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. 
JER.8.6	I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle. 
JER.8.7	Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the ordinance of the 
JER.8.8	How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the 
JER.8.9	The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.10	Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
JER.8.11	And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the 
JER.8.13	I will utterly consume them, saith the 
JER.8.14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good came; 
JER.8.16	The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein. 
JER.8.17	For, behold, I will send serpents, basilisks, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith the 
JER.8.18	Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me. 
JER.8.19	Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: Is not the 
JER.8.20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. 
JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. 
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. 
JER.9.3	And they bend their tongue 
JER.9.4	Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will go about with slanders. 
JER.9.5	And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity. 
JER.9.6	Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the 
JER.9.7	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.9.8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him. 
JER.9.9	Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the 
JER.9.10	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled, they are gone. 
JER.9.11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
JER.9.12	Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and 
JER.9.13	And the 
JER.9.14	but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them: 
JER.9.15	therefore thus saith the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them. 
JER.9.17	Thus saith the 
JER.9.18	and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. 
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings. 
JER.9.20	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.9.21	For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, 
JER.9.22	Speak, Thus saith the 
JER.9.23	Thus saith the 
JER.9.24	but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth, and knoweth me, that I am the 
JER.9.25	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.9.26	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners 
JER.10.1	Hear ye the word which the 
JER.10.2	thus saith the 
JER.10.3	For the customs of the peoples are vanity: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe. 
JER.10.4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. 
JER.10.5	They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good. 
JER.10.6	There is none like unto thee, O 
JER.10.7	Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee. 
JER.10.8	But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols, it is but a stock. 
JER.10.9	There is silver beaten into plates which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of cunning men. 
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.11	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens. 
JER.10.12	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens: 
JER.10.13	when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. 
JER.10.14	Every man is become brutish 
JER.10.15	They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: the 
JER.10.17	Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege. 
JER.10.18	For thus saith the 
JER.10.19	Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is 
JER.10.20	My tent is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. 
JER.10.21	For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of the 
JER.10.22	The voice of a rumour, behold it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling place of jackals. 
JER.10.23	O 
JER.10.24	O 
JER.10.25	Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
JER.11.3	and say thou unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: 
JER.11.5	that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O 
JER.11.6	And the 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. 
JER.11.8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not. 
JER.11.9	And the 
JER.11.10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
JER.11.11	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.12	Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.13	For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal. 
JER.11.14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. 
JER.11.15	What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness 
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.17	For the 
JER.11.18	And the 
JER.11.19	But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, 
JER.11.20	But, O 
JER.11.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.22	therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.23	and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
JER.12.1	Righteous art thou, O 
JER.12.2	Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. 
JER.12.3	But thou, O 
JER.12.4	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end. 
JER.12.5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of Jordan? 
JER.12.6	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
JER.12.7	I have forsaken mine house, I have cast off mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. 
JER.12.8	Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her. 
JER.12.9	Is mine heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour. 
JER.12.10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 
JER.12.11	They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. 
JER.12.12	Spoilers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness: for the sword of the 
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.12.14	Thus saith the 
JER.12.15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land, 
JER.12.16	and it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As the 
JER.12.17	But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith the 
JER.13.1	Thus said the 
JER.13.2	So I bought a girdle according to the word of the 
JER.13.3	And the word of the 
JER.13.4	Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. 
JER.13.5	So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	And it came to pass after many days, that the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing. 
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	Thus saith the 
JER.13.10	This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing. 
JER.13.11	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the 
JER.13.12	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith the 
JER.13.13	Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.13.14	And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the 
JER.13.15	Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.17	But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for 
JER.13.18	Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory. 
JER.13.19	The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive all of it; it is wholly carried away captive. 
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? 
JER.13.21	What wilt thou say, when he shall set 
JER.13.22	And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels suffer violence. 
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. 
JER.13.24	Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness. 
JER.13.25	This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith the 
JER.13.26	Therefore will I also discover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear. 
JER.13.27	I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
JER.14.3	And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the pits, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty: they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads. 
JER.14.4	Because of the ground which is chapt, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads. 
JER.14.5	Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh 
JER.14.6	And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage. 
JER.14.7	Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name's sake, O 
JER.14.8	O thou hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? 
JER.14.9	Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O 
JER.14.10	Thus saith the 
JER.14.11	And the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; 
JER.14.13	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
JER.14.17	And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound. 
JER.14.18	If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge. 
JER.14.19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold dismay! 
JER.14.20	We acknowledge, O 
JER.14.21	Do not abhor 
JER.14.22	Are there any among the vanities of the heathen that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O 
JER.15.1	Then said the 
JER.15.2	And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the 
JER.15.3	And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the 
JER.15.4	And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem. 
JER.15.5	For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall turn aside to ask of thy welfare? 
JER.15.6	Thou hast rejected me, saith the 
JER.15.7	And I have fanned them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved 
JER.15.8	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly. 
JER.15.9	She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent on usury, neither have men lent to me on usury; 
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.12	Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass? 
JER.15.13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. 
JER.15.14	And I will make 
JER.15.15	O 
JER.15.16	Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O 
JER.15.17	I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced: I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation. 
JER.15.18	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful 
JER.15.19	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.15.20	And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the 
JER.15.21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
JER.16.1	The word of the 
JER.16.2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. 
JER.16.3	For thus saith the 
JER.16.4	They shall die of grievous deaths; they shalt not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
JER.16.5	For thus saith the 
JER.16.6	Both great and small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them: 
JER.16.7	neither shall men break 
JER.16.8	And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink. 
JER.16.9	For thus saith the 
JER.16.10	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the 
JER.16.11	Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the 
JER.16.12	and ye have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto me: 
JER.16.13	therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; for I will shew you no favour.
JER.16.14	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.16.15	but, As the 
JER.16.16	Behold, I will send for many fishers saith the 
JER.16.17	For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes. 
JER.16.18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have polluted my land with the carcases of their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations. 
JER.16.19	O 
JER.16.20	Shall a man make unto himself gods, which yet are no gods? 
JER.16.21	Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.
JER.17.1	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, 
JER.17.2	whilst their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees upon the high hills. 
JER.17.3	O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil, 
JER.17.4	And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever.
JER.17.5	Thus saith the 
JER.17.6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited. 
JER.17.7	Blessed is the man that trusteth in the 
JER.17.8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out his roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat cometh, but his leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. 
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is desperately sick: who can know it? 
JER.17.10	I the 
JER.17.11	As the partridge that gathereth 
JER.17.12	A glorious throne, 
JER.17.13	O 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.15	Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the 
JER.17.16	As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face. 
JER.17.17	Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil. 
JER.17.18	Let them be ashamed that persecute me, but let not me be ashamed; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	Thus said the 
JER.17.20	and say unto them, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.17.21	Thus saith the 
JER.17.22	neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers; 
JER.17.23	But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction. 
JER.17.24	And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the 
JER.17.25	then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. 
JER.17.26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the mountains, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and oblations, and frankincense, and bringing 
JER.17.27	But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. 
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought his work on the wheels. 
JER.18.4	And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. 
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the 
JER.18.7	At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it; 
JER.18.8	if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 
JER.18.9	And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 
JER.18.10	if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
JER.18.11	Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.18.12	But they say, There is no hope: for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart. 
JER.18.13	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.18.14	Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? 
JER.18.15	For my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity; and they have caused them to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up; 
JER.18.16	to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head. 
JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will look upon their back, and not their face, in the day of their calamity.
JER.18.18	Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. 
JER.18.19	Give heed to me, O 
JER.18.20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy fury from them. 
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, 
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. 
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.19.1	Thus said the 
JER.19.2	and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee: 
JER.19.3	and say, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; 
JER.19.5	and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: 
JER.19.6	therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
JER.19.8	And I will make this city an astonishment, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof. 
JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall straiten them.
JER.19.10	Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, 
JER.19.11	and shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.19.12	Thus will I do unto this place, saith the 
JER.19.13	and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. 
JER.19.14	Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither the 
JER.19.15	Thus saith the 
JER.20.1	Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of the 
JER.20.2	Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of the 
JER.20.3	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The 
JER.20.4	For thus saith the 
JER.20.5	Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.8	For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and spoil: because the word of the 
JER.20.9	And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in mine heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot 
JER.20.10	For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, 
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.12	But, O 
JER.20.13	Sing unto the 
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed. 
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad. 
JER.20.16	And let that man be as the cities which the 
JER.20.17	because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother should have been my grave, and her womb always great. 
JER.20.18	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	Inquire, I pray thee, of the 
JER.21.3	Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 
JER.21.4	Thus saith the 
JER.21.5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
JER.21.6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence. 
JER.21.7	And afterward, saith the 
JER.21.8	And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the 
JER.21.9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth away to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. 
JER.21.10	For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith the 
JER.21.11	And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of the 
JER.21.12	O house of David, thus saith the 
JER.21.13	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, 
JER.21.14	And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the 
JER.22.1	Thus said the 
JER.22.2	And say, Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	Thus saith the 
JER.22.4	For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
JER.22.5	But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the 
JER.22.6	For thus saith the 
JER.22.7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. 
JER.22.8	And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the 
JER.22.9	Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country. 
JER.22.11	For thus saith the 
JER.22.12	But in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more. 
JER.22.13	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not his hire; 
JER.22.14	that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. 
JER.22.15	Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgement and justice? then it was well with him. 
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith the 
JER.22.17	But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it. 
JER.22.18	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.22.19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan: and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed. 
JER.22.21	I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice. 
JER.22.22	The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. 
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! 
JER.22.24	As I live, saith the 
JER.22.25	and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
JER.22.26	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. 
JER.22.27	But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return. 
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not? 
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	Thus saith the 
JER.23.1	Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.23.3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply. 
JER.23.4	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith the 
JER.23.5	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.23.6	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The 
JER.23.7	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.23.8	but, As the 
JER.23.9	Concerning the prophets. Mine heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome; because of the 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up; and their course is evil, and their force is not right, 
JER.23.11	for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the 
JER.23.12	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the 
JER.23.13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. 
JER.23.14	In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies, and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. 
JER.23.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.23.16	Thus saith the 
JER.23.17	They say continually unto them that despise me, The 
JER.23.18	For who hath stood in the council of the 
JER.23.19	Behold, the tempest of the 
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.21	I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied. 
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. 
JER.23.23	Am I a God at hand, saith the 
JER.23.24	Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the 
JER.23.25	I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. 
JER.23.26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies; even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart? 
JER.23.27	which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal. 
JER.23.28	The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith the 
JER.23.29	Is not my word like as fire? saith the 
JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the 
JER.23.31	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the 
JER.23.32	Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith the 
JER.23.33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the 
JER.23.34	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the 
JER.23.35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the 
JER.23.36	And the burden of the 
JER.23.37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the 
JER.23.38	But if ye say, The burden of the 
JER.23.39	therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence: 
JER.23.40	and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten.
JER.24.1	The 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
JER.24.3	Then said the 
JER.24.4	And the word of the 
JER.24.5	Thus saith the 
JER.24.6	For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. 
JER.24.7	And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the 
JER.24.8	And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the 
JER.24.9	I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. 
JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah; the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 
JER.25.2	the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: 
JER.25.3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of the 
JER.25.4	And the 
JER.25.5	saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the 
JER.25.6	and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. 
JER.25.7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the 
JER.25.8	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.25.9	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the 
JER.25.10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 
JER.25.11	And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
JER.25.12	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the 
JER.25.13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them, even of them: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
JER.25.15	For thus saith the 
JER.25.16	And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. 
JER.25.17	Then took I the cup at the 
JER.25.18	, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 
JER.25.20	and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 
JER.25.21	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon; 
JER.25.22	and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; 
JER.25.23	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners 
JER.25.24	and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness; 
JER.25.25	and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; 
JER.25.26	and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. 
JER.25.27	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.25.28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.25.29	For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the 
JER.25.30	Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The 
JER.25.31	A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for the 
JER.25.32	Thus saith the 
JER.25.33	And the slain of the 
JER.25.34	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves 
JER.25.35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. 
JER.25.36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the howling of the principal of the flock! for the 
JER.25.37	And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing 
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from the 
JER.26.2	Thus saith the 
JER.26.3	It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. 
JER.26.4	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.26.5	to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even rising up early and sending them, but ye have not hearkened; 
JER.26.6	then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
JER.26.7	And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.10	And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house unto the house of the 
JER.26.11	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. 
JER.26.12	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The 
JER.26.13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the 
JER.26.14	But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes. 
JER.26.15	Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye shall bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the 
JER.26.16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying, 
JER.26.18	Micaiah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the 
JER.26.20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt: 
JER.26.22	and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, 
JER.26.23	and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. 
JER.26.24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.27.2	Thus saith the 
JER.27.3	and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 
JER.27.4	and give them a charge unto their masters; saying, Thus saith the 
JER.27.5	I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me. 
JER.27.6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him. 
JER.27.7	And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him. 
JER.27.8	And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the 
JER.27.9	But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: 
JER.27.10	for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out and ye should perish. 
JER.27.11	But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that 
JER.27.12	And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
JER.27.13	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. 
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.27.16	Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.27.17	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation? 
JER.27.18	But if they be prophets, and if the word of the 
JER.27.19	For thus saith the 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
JER.27.21	yea, thus saith the 
JER.27.22	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith the 
JER.28.1	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the 
JER.28.2	Thus speaketh the 
JER.28.3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the 
JER.28.6	even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: 
JER.28.8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
JER.28.9	The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. 
JER.28.11	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.28.12	Then the word of the 
JER.28.13	Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.28.14	For thus saith the 
JER.28.15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; the 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.28.17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
JER.29.2	(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, 
JER.29.3	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,) saying, 
JER.29.4	Thus saith the 
JER.29.5	Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 
JER.29.6	Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply ye there, and be not diminished. 
JER.29.7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto the 
JER.29.8	For thus saith the 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.29.10	For thus saith the 
JER.29.11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the 
JER.29.12	And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. 
JER.29.13	And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all year heart. 
JER.29.14	And I will be found of you, saith the 
JER.29.15	For ye have said, The 
JER.29.16	for thus saith the 
JER.29.17	thus saith the 
JER.29.18	And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: 
JER.29.19	because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the 
JER.29.20	Hear ye therefore the word of the 
JER.29.21	Thus saith the 
JER.29.22	and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The 
JER.29.23	because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith the 
JER.29.24	And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying, 
JER.29.25	Thus speaketh the 
JER.29.26	The 
JER.29.27	Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you, 
JER.29.28	forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, 
JER.29.29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 
JER.29.30	Then came the word of the 
JER.29.31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.29.32	therefore thus saith the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.30.2	Thus speaketh the 
JER.30.3	For, lo, the days come, saith the 
JER.30.4	And these are the words that the 
JER.30.5	For thus saith the 
JER.30.6	Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? 
JER.30.7	Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. 
JER.30.8	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
JER.30.9	but they shall serve the 
JER.30.10	Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the 
JER.30.11	For I am with thee, saith the 
JER.30.12	For thus saith the 
JER.30.13	There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. 
JER.30.14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one; for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased. 
JER.30.15	Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. 
JER.30.16	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. 
JER.30.17	For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the 
JER.30.18	Thus saith the 
JER.30.19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. 
JER.30.20	Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. 
JER.30.21	And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith the 
JER.30.22	And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
JER.30.23	Behold, the tempest of the 
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.31.1	At that time, saith the 
JER.31.2	Thus saith the 
JER.31.3	The 
JER.31.4	Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. 
JER.31.5	Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy 
JER.31.6	For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the 
JER.31.7	For thus saith the 
JER.31.8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, 
JER.31.9	They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
JER.31.10	Hear the word of the 
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.12	And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together unto the goodness of the 
JER.31.13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. 
JER.31.14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the 
JER.31.15	Thus saith the 
JER.31.16	Thus saith the 
JER.31.17	And there is hope for thy latter end, saith the 
JER.31.18	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself 
JER.31.19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 
JER.31.20	Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the 
JER.31.21	Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. 
JER.31.22	How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for the 
JER.31.23	Thus saith the 
JER.31.24	And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together; the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks. 
JER.31.25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished. 
JER.31.26	Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
JER.31.27	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.28	And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to overthrow and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith the 
JER.31.29	In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge. 
JER.31.30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge. 
JER.31.31	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the 
JER.31.33	But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the 
JER.31.34	and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the 
JER.31.35	Thus saith the 
JER.31.36	If these ordinances depart from before me, saith the 
JER.31.37	Thus saith the 
JER.31.38	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall yet go out straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah. 
JER.31.40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the 
JER.32.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	Now at that time the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house. 
JER.32.3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the 
JER.32.4	and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; 
JER.32.5	and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the 
JER.32.6	And Jeremiah said, The word of the 
JER.32.7	Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. 
JER.32.8	So Hanamel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the 
JER.32.9	And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. 
JER.32.10	And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. 
JER.32.11	So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, 
JER.32.12	and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle's 
JER.32.13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
JER.32.14	Thus saith the 
JER.32.15	For thus saith the 
JER.32.16	Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the 
JER.32.17	Ah Lord 
JER.32.18	which shewest mercy unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the great, the mighty God, the 
JER.32.19	great in counsel, and mighty in work: whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men; to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: 
JER.32.20	which didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among 
JER.32.21	and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror; 
JER.32.22	and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing milk and honey; 
JER.32.23	and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them: 
JER.32.24	Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. 
JER.32.25	And thou hast said unto me, O Lord 
JER.32.26	Then came the word of the 
JER.32.27	Behold, I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.29	and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
JER.32.30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done that which was evil in my sight from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the 
JER.32.31	For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face: 
JER.32.32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
JER.32.33	And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. 
JER.32.34	But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. 
JER.32.35	And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through 
JER.32.36	And now therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.37	Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: 
JER.32.38	and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 
JER.32.39	and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them: 
JER.32.40	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. 
JER.32.41	Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. 
JER.32.42	For thus saith the 
JER.32.43	And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans; 
JER.32.44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the 
JER.33.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.2	Thus saith the 
JER.33.3	Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and will shew thee great things, and difficult, which thou knowest not. 
JER.33.4	For thus saith the 
JER.33.5	they come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. 
JER.33.6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth. 
JER.33.7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 
JER.33.8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me. 
JER.33.9	And 
JER.33.10	Thus saith the 
JER.33.11	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, Give thanks to the 
JER.33.12	Thus saith the 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the 
JER.33.14	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.33.15	In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgement and righteousness in the land. 
JER.33.16	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is 
JER.33.17	For thus saith the 
JER.33.18	neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn oblations, and to do sacrifice continually. 
JER.33.19	And the word of the 
JER.33.20	Thus saith the 
JER.33.21	then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me. 
JER.33.23	And the word of the 
JER.33.24	Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the 
JER.33.25	Thus saith the 
JER.33.26	then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.
JER.34.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	Thus saith the 
JER.34.3	and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.34.5	thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee, 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
JER.34.7	when the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these 
JER.34.8	The word that came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, 
JER.34.10	And all the princes and all the people obeyed, which had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go: 
JER.34.11	but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids: 
JER.34.12	Therefore the word of the 
JER.34.13	Thus saith the 
JER.34.14	At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. 
JER.34.15	And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 
JER.34.16	but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. 
JER.34.17	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.34.18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof; 
JER.34.19	the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf; 
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 
JER.34.21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. 
JER.34.22	Behold, I will command, saith the 
JER.35.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the 
JER.35.3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 
JER.35.4	and I brought them into the house of the 
JER.35.5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
JER.35.6	But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever: 
JER.35.7	neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn. 
JER.35.8	And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 
JER.35.9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: 
JER.35.10	but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.
JER.35.12	Then came the word of the 
JER.35.13	Thus saith the 
JER.35.14	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed, and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father's commandment: but I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me. 
JER.35.15	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. 
JER.35.16	Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me; 
JER.35.17	therefore thus saith the 
JER.35.18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the 
JER.35.19	therefore thus saith the 
JER.36.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.36.2	Take thee a roll of a book, and write thereon all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. 
JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. 
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the 
JER.36.5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the 
JER.36.6	therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the 
JER.36.7	It may be they will present their supplication before the 
JER.36.8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the 
JER.36.9	Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before the 
JER.36.10	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the 
JER.36.11	And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the 
JER.36.12	he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
JER.36.13	Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. 
JER.36.15	And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. 
JER.36.16	Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. 
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? 
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. 
JER.36.19	Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
JER.36.20	And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king. 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and 
JER.36.23	And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that 
JER.36.24	And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. 
JER.36.25	Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. 
JER.36.26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the 
JER.36.27	Then the word of the 
JER.36.28	Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. 
JER.36.29	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith the 
JER.36.30	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.36.31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not. 
JER.36.32	Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.
JER.37.1	And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 
JER.37.2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the 
JER.37.3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison. 
JER.37.5	And Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem. 
JER.37.6	Then came the word of the 
JER.37.7	Thus saith the 
JER.37.8	And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire. 
JER.37.9	Thus saith the 
JER.37.10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
JER.37.11	And it came to pass that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, 
JER.37.12	then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people. 
JER.37.13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans. 
JER.37.14	Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans; but he hearkened not to him: so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. 
JER.37.15	And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. 
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 
JER.37.17	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where now are your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? 
JER.37.20	And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. 
JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.1	And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying, 
JER.38.2	Thus saith the 
JER.38.3	Thus saith the 
JER.38.4	Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. 
JER.38.5	And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you. 
JER.38.6	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: and Jeremiah sank in the mire. 
JER.38.7	Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an eunuch, which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 
JER.38.8	Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying, 
JER.38.9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is because of the famine: for there is no more bread in the city. 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
JER.38.12	And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the 
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me. 
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the 
JER.38.17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the 
JER.38.18	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. 
JER.38.19	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. 
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the 
JER.38.21	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the 
JER.38.22	behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: 
JER.38.23	And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. 
JER.38.24	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. 
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death: also what the king said unto thee: 
JER.38.26	then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there. 
JER.38.27	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. 
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken,
JER.39.1	(IN the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it; 
JER.39.2	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city:) 
JER.39.3	that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. 
JER.39.4	And it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the Arabah. 
JER.39.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgement upon him. 
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also, that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained. 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, 
JER.39.12	Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee. 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; 
JER.39.14	they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people. 
JER.39.15	Now the word of the 
JER.39.16	Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the 
JER.40.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, the 
JER.40.3	and the 
JER.40.4	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and convenient unto thee to go, thither go. 
JER.40.5	Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, 
JER.40.6	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
JER.40.7	Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; 
JER.40.8	then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 
JER.40.9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 
JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans, which shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. 
JER.40.11	Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; 
JER.40.12	then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much. 
JER.40.13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
JER.40.14	and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish? 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
JER.41.1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and 
JER.41.2	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, even the men of war. 
JER.41.4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 
JER.41.5	that there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with oblations and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the 
JER.41.6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. 
JER.41.7	And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, 
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. 
JER.41.9	Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah, (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. 
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
JER.41.12	then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	Now it came to pass that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. 
JER.41.14	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. 
JER.41.16	Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: 
JER.41.17	and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near, 
JER.42.2	and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the 
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, The 
JER.42.6	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the 
JER.42.7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 
JER.42.9	and said unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.42.10	If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you. 
JER.42.11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the 
JER.42.12	And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. 
JER.42.13	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of the 
JER.42.14	saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: 
JER.42.15	now therefore hear ye the word of the 
JER.42.16	then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feel shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. 
JER.42.17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. 
JER.42.18	For thus saith the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto the 
JER.42.21	and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.
JER.43.1	And it came to pass that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the 
JER.43.3	but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives to Babylon. 
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the 
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of Judah; 
JER.43.6	the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah; 
JER.43.7	and they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of the 
JER.43.8	Then came the word of the 
JER.43.9	Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 
JER.43.10	and say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.43.11	And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death 
JER.43.12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. 
JER.43.13	He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwelt in the land of Egypt, which dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
JER.44.2	Thus saith the 
JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, 
JER.44.4	Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. 
JER.44.5	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
JER.44.6	Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day. 
JER.44.7	Therefore now thus saith the 
JER.44.8	in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
JER.44.9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. 
JER.44.11	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed, by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, 
JER.44.13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: 
JER.44.14	so that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.
JER.44.15	Then all the men which knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 
JER.44.16	As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. 
JER.44.18	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 
JER.44.19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our husbands?
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people which had given him that answer, saying, 
JER.44.21	The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the 
JER.44.22	so the 
JER.44.23	Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	Thus saith the 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear ye the word of the 
JER.44.27	Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. 
JER.44.28	And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs. 
JER.44.29	And this shall be the sign unto you, saith the 
JER.44.30	Thus saith the 
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah; saying, 
JER.45.2	Thus saith the 
JER.45.3	Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the 
JER.45.4	Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith the 
JER.45.5	And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the 
JER.46.1	The word of the 
JER.46.2	Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah. 
JER.46.3	Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 
JER.46.4	Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail. 
JER.46.5	Wherefore have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: terror is on every side, saith the 
JER.46.6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled, and fallen. 
JER.46.7	Who is this that riseth up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers? 
JER.46.8	Egypt riseth up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. 
JER.46.9	Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow. 
JER.46.10	For that day is 
JER.46.11	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together. 
JER.46.13	The word that the 
JER.46.14	Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, stand forth, and prepare thee; for the sword hath devoured round about thee. 
JER.46.15	Why are thy strong ones swept away? they stood not, because the 
JER.46.16	He made many to stumble, yea, they fell one upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. 
JER.46.17	They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the appointed time pass by. 
JER.46.18	As I live, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.46.19	O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant. 
JER.46.20	Egypt is a very fair heifer; 
JER.46.21	Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation. 
JER.46.22	The sound thereof shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. 
JER.46.23	They shall cut down her forest, saith the 
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. 
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the 
JER.46.27	But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, low, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. 
JER.46.28	Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith the 
JER.47.1	The word of the 
JER.47.2	Thus saith the 
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands; 
JER.47.4	because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the 
JER.47.5	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nought, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? 
JER.47.6	O thou sword of the 
JER.47.7	How canst thou be quiet, seeing the 
JER.48.1	Of Moab. Thus saith the 
JER.48.2	The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her, Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue thee. 
JER.48.3	The sound of a cry from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction! 
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. 
JER.48.5	For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for in the going down of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction. 
JER.48.6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. 
JER.48.7	For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together. 
JER.48.8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as the 
JER.48.9	Give wings unto Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein. 
JER.48.10	Cursed be he that doeth the work of the 
JER.48.11	Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed. 
JER.48.12	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.48.13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.
JER.48.14	How say ye, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war? 
JER.48.15	Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into her cities; and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.48.16	The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. 
JER.48.17	All ye that are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye that know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod! 
JER.48.18	O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, he hath destroyed thy strong holds. 
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What hath been done? 
JER.48.20	Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste. 
JER.48.21	And judgement is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath; 
JER.48.22	and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim; 
JER.48.23	and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon; 
JER.48.24	and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the 
JER.48.26	Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against the 
JER.48.27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest the head. 
JER.48.28	O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth. 
JER.48.29	We have heard of the pride of Moab, 
JER.48.30	I know his wrath, saith the 
JER.48.31	Therefore will I howl for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn. 
JER.48.32	With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the spoiler is fallen. 
JER.48.33	And gladness and joy is taken away, from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting. 
JER.48.34	From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate. 
JER.48.35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the 
JER.48.36	Therefore mine heart soundeth for Moab like pipes, and mine heart soundeth like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished. 
JER.48.37	For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the 
JER.48.39	How is it broken down! 
JER.48.40	For thus saith the 
JER.48.41	Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. 
JER.48.42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the 
JER.48.43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the 
JER.48.44	He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon her, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the 
JER.48.45	They that fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon: for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. 
JER.48.46	Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone: for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity. 
JER.48.47	Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the 
JER.49.1	Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith the 
JER.49.2	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.49.3	Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. 
JER.49.4	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, 
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, the 
JER.49.6	But afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the 
JER.49.7	Of Edom. Thus saith the 
JER.49.8	Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. 
JER.49.9	If grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough? 
JER.49.10	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not. 
JER.49.11	Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. 
JER.49.12	For thus saith the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself, saith the 
JER.49.14	I have heard tidings from the 
JER.49.15	For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men. 
JER.49.16	As for thy terribleness, the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the 
JER.49.17	And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall he astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. 
JER.49.18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the 
JER.49.19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of Jordan against the strong habitation: but I will suddenly make him run away from her; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over her: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? 
JER.49.20	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the 
JER.49.21	The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea. 
JER.49.22	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.49.23	Of Damascus. Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. 
JER.49.24	Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail. 
JER.49.25	How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy? 
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the 
JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
JER.49.28	Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote: Thus saith the 
JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side. 
JER.49.30	Flee ye, wander far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the 
JER.49.31	Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith the 
JER.49.32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners 
JER.49.33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	Thus saith the 
JER.49.36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. 
JER.49.37	And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the 
JER.49.38	and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the 
JER.49.39	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the 
JER.50.1	The word that the 
JER.50.2	Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed. 
JER.50.3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast. 
JER.50.4	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.5	They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, 
JER.50.6	My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place. 
JER.50.7	All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the 
JER.50.8	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.
JER.50.9	For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain. 
JER.50.10	And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the 
JER.50.11	Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder mine heritage, because ye are wanton as an heifer that treadeth out 
JER.50.12	your mother shall be sore ashamed; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. 
JER.50.13	Because of the wrath of the 
JER.50.14	Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Shout against her round about; she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. 
JER.50.17	Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. 
JER.50.18	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.50.19	And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. 
JER.50.20	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.21	Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith the 
JER.50.22	A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. 
JER.50.23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
JER.50.24	I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. 
JER.50.27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 
JER.50.28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.29	Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; camp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the 
JER.50.30	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the 
JER.50.31	Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, the 
JER.50.32	And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.
JER.50.33	Thus saith the 
JER.50.34	Their redeemer is strong; the 
JER.50.35	A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the 
JER.50.36	A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed. 
JER.50.37	A sword is upon their horse, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her, and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed. 
JER.50.38	A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad upon idols. 
JER.50.39	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. 
JER.50.40	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the 
JER.50.41	Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. 
JER.50.42	They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses; every one set in array, as man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. 
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon hath heard the fame of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, 
JER.50.44	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of Jordan against the strong habitation: but I will suddenly make them run away from her; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over her: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? 
JER.50.45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the 
JER.50.46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.
JER.51.1	Thus saith the 
JER.51.2	And I will send unto Babylon strangers, that shall fan her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. 
JER.51.3	Let not the archer bend his bow, and let him not lift himself up in his coat of mail: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. 
JER.51.4	And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets. 
JER.51.5	For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of the 
JER.51.6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be not cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of the 
JER.51.7	Babylon hath been a golden cup in the 
JER.51.8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. 
JER.51.9	We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgement reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. 
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.11	Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: the 
JER.51.12	Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the 
JER.51.13	O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness. 
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.15	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens: 
JER.51.16	when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. 
JER.51.17	Every man is become brutish 
JER.51.18	They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and 
JER.51.20	Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: and with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; 
JER.51.21	and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and him that rideth therein; 
JER.51.22	and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid; 
JER.51.23	and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke 
JER.51.24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the 
JER.51.25	Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the 
JER.51.26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the 
JER.51.27	Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough cankerworm. 
JER.51.28	Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, the governors thereof, and all the deputies thereof, and all the land of his dominion. 
JER.51.29	And the land trembleth and is in pain: for the purposes of the 
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strong holds; their might hath failed; they are become as women: her dwelling places are set on fire; her bars are broken. 
JER.51.31	One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter: 
JER.51.32	and the passages are surprised, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted. 
JER.51.33	For thus saith the 
JER.51.34	Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his maw with my delicates; he hath cast me out. 
JER.51.35	The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. 
JER.51.36	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.51.37	And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for jackals, an astonishment, and an hissing, without inhabitant. 
JER.51.38	They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions' whelps. 
JER.51.39	When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats. 
JER.51.41	How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
JER.51.42	The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. 
JER.51.43	Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby. 
JER.51.44	And I will do judgement upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall. 
JER.51.45	My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of the 
JER.51.46	And let not your heart faint, neither fear ye for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; for a rumour shall come one year, and after that in another year 
JER.51.47	Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgement upon the graven images of Babylon, and her whole land shall be ashamed; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. 
JER.51.48	Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the 
JER.51.49	As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land. 
JER.51.50	Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember the 
JER.51.51	We are ashamed, because we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the 
JER.51.52	Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the 
JER.51.54	The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! 
JER.51.55	For the 
JER.51.56	for the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces: for the 
JER.51.57	And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.51.58	Thus saith the 
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain. 
JER.51.60	And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon. 
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words, 
JER.51.62	and say, O 
JER.51.63	And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: 
JER.51.64	and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
JER.52.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
JER.52.3	For through the anger of the 
JER.52.4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
JER.52.6	In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about:) and they went by the way of the Arabah. 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgement upon him. 
JER.52.10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
JER.52.11	And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, which stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem: 
JER.52.13	and he burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest sort of the people, and the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. 
JER.52.17	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the 
JER.52.18	The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 
JER.52.19	And the cups, and the firepans, and the basons, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. 
JER.52.20	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of the 
JER.52.21	And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow. 
JER.52.22	And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates. 
JER.52.23	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were an hundred upon the network round about.
JER.52.24	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
JER.52.25	and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king's face, which were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. 
JER.52.26	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
JER.52.27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. 
JER.52.28	This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 
JER.52.30	in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
JER.52.31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the 
JER.52.32	and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, 
JER.52.33	and he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life, 
JER.52.34	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
LAM.1.1	How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! 
LAM.1.2	She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. 
LAM.1.3	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her within the straits. 
LAM.1.4	The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; all her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness. 
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; for the 
LAM.1.6	And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. 
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, the adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations. 
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. 
LAM.1.9	Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end; therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: behold, O 
LAM.1.10	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen are entered into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation. 
LAM.1.11	All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to refresh the soul: see, O 
LAM.1.12	Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the 
LAM.1.13	From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate and faint all the day. 
LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; they are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand. 
LAM.1.15	The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah. 
LAM.1.16	For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed. 
LAM.1.17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; the 
LAM.1.18	The 
LAM.1.19	I called for my lovers, 
LAM.1.20	Behold, O 
LAM.1.21	They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me. 
LAM.1.22	Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.
LAM.2.1	How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! he hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. 
LAM.2.2	The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied; he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof. 
LAM.2.3	He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: and he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. 
LAM.2.4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his fury like fire. 
LAM.2.5	The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel; he hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strong holds: and he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. 
LAM.2.6	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: the 
LAM.2.7	The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: they have made a noise in the house of the 
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.9	Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; yea, her prophets find no vision from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. 
LAM.2.11	Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. 
LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom. 
LAM.2.13	What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee? 
LAM.2.14	Thy prophets have seen visions for thee of vanity and foolishness; and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to bring again thy captivity: but have seen for thee burdens of vanity and causes of banishment. 
LAM.2.15	All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, 
LAM.2.16	All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up; certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it. 
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease. 
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the top of every street. 
LAM.2.20	See, O 
LAM.2.21	The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, 
LAM.2.22	Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side, and there was none that escaped or remained in the day of the 
LAM.3.1	I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 
LAM.3.2	He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light. 
LAM.3.3	Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day. 
LAM.3.4	My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 
LAM.3.5	He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. 
LAM.3.6	He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. 
LAM.3.7	He hath fenced me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy. 
LAM.3.8	Yea, when I cry and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer. 
LAM.3.9	He hath fenced up my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 
LAM.3.10	He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. 
LAM.3.11	He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate. 
LAM.3.12	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 
LAM.3.13	He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins. 
LAM.3.14	I am become a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. 
LAM.3.15	He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood. 
LAM.3.16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 
LAM.3.17	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity. 
LAM.3.18	And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from the 
LAM.3.19	Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 
LAM.3.20	My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.
LAM.3.21	This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. 
LAM.3.22	 the 
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness. 
LAM.3.24	The 
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.26	It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him. 
LAM.3.29	Let him put his mouth in the dust; if so be there may he hope. 
LAM.3.30	Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach. 
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not cast off for ever. 
LAM.3.32	For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 
LAM.3.33	For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. 
LAM.3.34	To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, 
LAM.3.35	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, 
LAM.3.36	To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
LAM.3.37	Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? 
LAM.3.38	Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good? 
LAM.3.39	Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 
LAM.3.40	Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned. 
LAM.3.43	Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 
LAM.3.44	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that 
LAM.3.45	Thou hast made us 
LAM.3.46	all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. 
LAM.3.47	Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction. 
LAM.3.48	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
LAM.3.49	Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 
LAM.3.50	Till the 
LAM.3.51	Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. 
LAM.3.52	They have chased me sore like a bird, that are mine enemies without cause. 
LAM.3.53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me. 
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over mine head; I said, I am cut off.
LAM.3.55	I called upon thy name, O 
LAM.3.56	Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 
LAM.3.57	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 
LAM.3.58	O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 
LAM.3.59	O 
LAM.3.60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. 
LAM.3.61	Thou hast heard their reproach, O 
LAM.3.62	The lips of those that rose up against me, and their imagination against me all the day. 
LAM.3.63	Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. 
LAM.3.64	Thou wilt render unto them a recompence, O 
LAM.3.65	Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them. 
LAM.3.66	Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How is the gold become dim! 
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 
LAM.4.3	Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. 
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 
LAM.4.5	They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dung-hills. 
LAM.4.6	For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her. 
LAM.4.7	Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire: 
LAM.4.8	Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 
LAM.4.9	They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger; for these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field. 
LAM.4.10	The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children; they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, that the adversary and the enemy should enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.14	They wander as blind men in the streets, that are polluted with blood, so that men cannot touch their garments. 
LAM.4.15	Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn 
LAM.4.16	The anger of the 
LAM.4.17	Our eyes do yet fail 
LAM.4.18	They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the 
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: the cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 
LAM.4.22	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
LAM.5.1	Remember, O what is 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, our houses unto aliens. 
LAM.5.3	We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. 
LAM.5.4	We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 
LAM.5.5	Our pursuers are upon our necks: we are weary, and have no rest. 
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
LAM.5.7	Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. 
LAM.5.8	Servants rule over us: there is none to deliver us out of their hand. 
LAM.5.9	We get our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 
LAM.5.10	Our skin is black like an oven because of the burning heat of famine. 
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion, the maidens in the cities of Judah. 
LAM.5.12	Princes were hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 
LAM.5.13	The young men bare the mill, and the children stumbled under the wood. 
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music. 
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
LAM.5.16	The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us! for we have sinned.
LAM.5.17	For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim; 
LAM.5.18	For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate; the foxes walk upon it. 
LAM.5.19	Thou, O 
LAM.5.20	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, 
LAM.5.21	Turn thou us unto thee, O 
LAM.5.22	But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art very wroth against us.
EZK.1.1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth 
EZK.1.2	In the fifth 
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 
EZK.1.5	And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. 
EZK.1.6	And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings. 
EZK.1.7	And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. 
EZK.1.8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they four had their faces and their wings 
EZK.1.9	their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. 
EZK.1.10	As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	And their faces and their wings were separate above; two 
EZK.1.12	And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went. 
EZK.1.13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; it went up and down among the living creatures: and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof. 
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went upon their four sides: they turned not when they went. 
EZK.1.18	As for their rings, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rings full of eyes round about. 
EZK.1.19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
EZK.1.20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.22	And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 
EZK.1.23	And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies. 
EZK.1.24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. 
EZK.1.25	And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
EZK.1.26	And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. 
EZK.1.27	And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. 
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the 
EZK.2.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee. 
EZK.2.2	And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me. 
EZK.2.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day. 
EZK.2.4	And the children are impudent and stiffhearted; I do send thee unto them: and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.2.5	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
EZK.2.6	And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. 
EZK.2.7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. 
EZK.2.8	But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. 
EZK.2.9	And when I looked, behold, an hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; 
EZK.2.10	And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
EZK.3.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel. 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll. 
EZK.3.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. 
EZK.3.4	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
EZK.3.5	For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; 
EZK.3.6	not to many peoples of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee. 
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of an hard forehead and of a stiff heart. 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shalt speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
EZK.3.11	And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.3.12	Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, 
EZK.3.13	And 
EZK.3.14	So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away: and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there astonied among them seven days.
EZK.3.16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the 
EZK.3.17	Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood wilt I require at thine hand. 
EZK.3.19	Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
EZK.3.20	Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.3.22	And the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. 
EZK.3.25	But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
EZK.3.26	and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.4.1	Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it a city, even Jerusalem: 
EZK.4.2	and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mount against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about. 
EZK.4.3	And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.4	Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: 
EZK.4.5	For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.6	And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee. 
EZK.4.7	And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.
EZK.4.9	Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; 
EZK.4.10	And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. 
EZK.4.11	And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. 
EZK.4.12	And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man. 
EZK.4.13	And the 
EZK.4.14	Then said I, Ah Lord 
EZK.4.15	Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon. 
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with carefulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 
EZK.4.17	that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword, as a barber's razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair. 
EZK.5.2	A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. 
EZK.5.3	And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
EZK.5.4	And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
EZK.5.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.6	And she hath rebelled against my judgements in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have rejected my judgements, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them. 
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.8	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 
EZK.5.10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgements in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds. 
EZK.5.11	Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.5.12	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them. 
EZK.5.13	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will satisfy my fury upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the 
EZK.5.14	Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach, among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. 
EZK.5.15	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgements in thee in anger and in fury, and in furious rebukes: I the 
EZK.5.16	when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you; and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread; 
EZK.5.17	and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I the 
EZK.6.1	And the word of the 
EZK.6.2	Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them, 
EZK.6.3	and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.6.4	your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. 
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
EZK.6.6	In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished. 
EZK.6.7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.8	Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. 
EZK.6.9	And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, how that I have been broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. 
EZK.6.10	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.6.12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. 
EZK.6.13	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.7.2	And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.7.3	Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations. 
EZK.7.4	And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.7.6	An end is come, the end is come, it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh. 
EZK.7.7	Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near; 
EZK.7.8	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations. 
EZK.7.9	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.7.10	Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. 
EZK.7.11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them 
EZK.7.12	The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. 
EZK.7.13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. 
EZK.7.15	The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
EZK.7.16	But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one in his iniquity. 
EZK.7.17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water. 
EZK.7.18	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. 
EZK.7.19	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the 
EZK.7.20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations 
EZK.7.21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it. 
EZK.7.22	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret 
EZK.7.23	Make the chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 
EZK.7.24	Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned. 
EZK.7.25	Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. 
EZK.7.26	Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
EZK.7.27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	And it came to in the sixth year, in the sixth 
EZK.8.2	Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire: and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. 
EZK.8.3	And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner 
EZK.8.4	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain. 
EZK.8.5	Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 
EZK.8.6	And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. 
EZK.8.9	And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here. 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. 
EZK.8.11	And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and the odour of the cloud of incense went up. 
EZK.8.12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, the 
EZK.8.13	He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do. 
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the 
EZK.8.15	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen 
EZK.8.16	And he brought me into the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen 
EZK.8.18	Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
EZK.9.1	Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. 
EZK.9.2	And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. 
EZK.9.3	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side. 
EZK.9.4	And the 
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 
EZK.9.6	slay utterly the old man, the young man and the maiden, and little children and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. 
EZK.9.7	And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city. 
EZK.9.8	And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord 
EZK.9.9	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting 
EZK.9.10	And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head. 
EZK.9.11	And behold, the man clothed in linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim, there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
EZK.10.2	And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling 
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
EZK.10.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh. 
EZK.10.6	And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling 
EZK.10.7	And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took 
EZK.10.8	And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings. 
EZK.10.9	And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone. 
EZK.10.10	And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went upon their four sides: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. 
EZK.10.12	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, 
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling 
EZK.10.14	And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
EZK.10.15	And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. 
EZK.10.16	And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them. 
EZK.10.18	And the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of the 
EZK.10.20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 
EZK.10.21	Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
EZK.10.22	And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.
EZK.11.1	Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the 
EZK.11.2	And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city, 
EZK.11.3	which say, 
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. 
EZK.11.5	And the spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. 
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.8	Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord 
EZK.11.9	And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgements among you. 
EZK.11.10	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This 
EZK.11.12	and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord 
EZK.11.14	And the word of the 
EZK.11.15	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, 
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.18	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 
EZK.11.19	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: 
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord 
EZK.11.22	Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
EZK.11.23	And the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
EZK.11.25	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not, which have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.3	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.4	And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile. 
EZK.12.5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. 
EZK.12.6	In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel. 
EZK.12.7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight. 
EZK.12.8	And in the morning came the word of the 
EZK.12.9	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou? 
EZK.12.10	Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.11	Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall go into exile, into captivity. 
EZK.12.12	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the ground with his eyes. 
EZK.12.13	My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there. 
EZK.12.14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them. 
EZK.12.15	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.12.18	Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness; 
EZK.12.19	and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	And the word of the 
EZK.12.22	Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? 
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.24	For there shall be no more any vain vision, nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
EZK.12.25	For I am the 
EZK.12.26	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.27	Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off. 
EZK.12.28	Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.1	And the word of the 
EZK.13.2	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of the 
EZK.13.3	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.4	O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places. 
EZK.13.5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the fence for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of the 
EZK.13.6	They have seen vanity and lying divination, that say, The 
EZK.13.7	Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The 
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.9	And mine hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.13.10	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered 
EZK.13.11	say unto them which daub it with untempered 
EZK.13.12	Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? 
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.14	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered 
EZK.13.15	Thus will I accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered 
EZK.13.16	, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord 
EZK.13.17	And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, 
EZK.13.18	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.19	And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies. 
EZK.13.20	Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive: 
EZK.13.23	therefore ye shall no more see vanity, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. 
EZK.14.2	And the word of the 
EZK.14.3	Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them? 
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.5	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols. 
EZK.14.6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.7	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I the 
EZK.14.8	and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	And if the prophet be deceived and speaketh a word, I the 
EZK.14.10	And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh 
EZK.14.11	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.12	And the word of the 
EZK.14.13	Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out mine hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast; 
EZK.14.14	though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.15	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts; 
EZK.14.16	though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.17	Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast; 
EZK.14.18	though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 
EZK.14.20	though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.21	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it. 
EZK.14.23	And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord 
EZK.15.1	And the word of the 
EZK.15.2	Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
EZK.15.3	Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
EZK.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel: the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned; is it profitable for any work? 
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work? 
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.16.2	Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 
EZK.16.3	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.4	And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. 
EZK.16.5	None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born.
EZK.16.6	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, 
EZK.16.7	I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thine hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare. 
EZK.16.8	Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.9	Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk. 
EZK.16.11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. 
EZK.16.12	And I put a ring upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head. 
EZK.16.13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate. 
EZK.16.14	And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.15	But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was. 
EZK.16.16	And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colours, and playedst the harlot upon them: 
EZK.16.17	Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them; 
EZK.16.18	and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour, and 
EZK.16.20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter, 
EZK.16.21	that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through 
EZK.16.22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood. 
EZK.16.23	And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord 
EZK.16.24	that thou hast built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street. 
EZK.16.25	Thou hast built thy lofty place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom. 
EZK.16.26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger. 
EZK.16.27	Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary 
EZK.16.28	Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom in the land of Canaan, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith. 
EZK.16.30	How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.31	in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire. 
EZK.16.32	A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband! 
EZK.16.33	They give gifts to all harlots: but thou gavest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms. 
EZK.16.34	And the contrary is in thee from 
EZK.16.35	Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.37	therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. 
EZK.16.38	And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels: and they shall leave thee naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They shall also bring up an assembly against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgements upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more. 
EZK.16.42	So will I satisfy my fury upon thee, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. 
EZK.16.43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; therefore behold, I also will bring thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.44	Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use 
EZK.16.45	Thou art thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. 
EZK.16.47	Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as 
EZK.16.48	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom; pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw 
EZK.16.51	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done. 
EZK.16.52	Thou also, bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgement for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. 
EZK.16.53	And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them: 
EZK.16.54	that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. 
EZK.16.55	And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. 
EZK.16.56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride; 
EZK.16.57	before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which do despite unto thee round about. 
EZK.16.58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the 
EZK.16.59	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. 
EZK.16.61	Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder 
EZK.16.62	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame; when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord 
EZK.17.1	And the word of the 
EZK.17.2	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; 
EZK.17.3	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.4	he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants. 
EZK.17.5	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow tree. 
EZK.17.6	And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. 
EZK.17.7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it. 
EZK.17.8	It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine. 
EZK.17.9	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.10	Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither; when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew. 
EZK.17.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.17.12	Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon; 
EZK.17.13	and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land: 
EZK.17.14	that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand. 
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape? 
EZK.17.16	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.17.17	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, when they cast up mounts and build forts, to cut off many persons. 
EZK.17.18	For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape. 
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.20	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. 
EZK.17.21	And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.17.22	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.23	in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. 
EZK.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the 
EZK.18.1	The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, 
EZK.18.2	What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? 
EZK.18.3	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. 
EZK.18.5	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 
EZK.18.6	and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her separation; 
EZK.18.7	and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 
EZK.18.8	he that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgement between man and man, 
EZK.18.9	hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgements, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.10	If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things, 
EZK.18.11	and that doeth not any of those 
EZK.18.12	hath wronged the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 
EZK.18.13	hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations: he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. 
EZK.18.14	Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doth not such like, 
EZK.18.15	that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, 
EZK.18.16	neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 
EZK.18.17	that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgements, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. 
EZK.18.18	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity. 
EZK.18.19	Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. 
EZK.18.20	The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.18.22	None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. 
EZK.18.23	Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord 
EZK.18.24	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. 
EZK.18.25	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? 
EZK.18.26	When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. 
EZK.18.27	Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. 
EZK.18.28	Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
EZK.18.30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereto ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord 
EZK.19.1	Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
EZK.19.2	and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps. 
EZK.19.3	And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion: and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men. 
EZK.19.4	The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit: and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt. 
EZK.19.5	Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion. 
EZK.19.6	And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion: and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men. 
EZK.19.7	And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring. 
EZK.19.8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces: and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit. 
EZK.19.9	And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strong holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. 
EZK.19.11	And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches. 
EZK.19.12	But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them. 
EZK.19.13	And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. 
EZK.19.14	And fire is gone out of the rods of her branches, it hath devoured her fruit, so that there is in her no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
EZK.20.1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth 
EZK.20.2	And the word of the 
EZK.20.3	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.4	Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
EZK.20.5	and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.6	in that day I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands: 
EZK.20.7	And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the 
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
EZK.20.10	So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgements, which if a man do, he shall live in them. 
EZK.20.12	Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected my judgements, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned: then I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
EZK.20.14	But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	Moreover also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 
EZK.20.16	because they rejected my judgements, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. 
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.18	And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgements, nor defile yourselves with their idols: 
EZK.20.19	I am the 
EZK.20.20	and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the 
EZK.20.21	But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgements to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths: then I said I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not he profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth. 
EZK.20.23	Moreover I lifted up mine hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries, 
EZK.20.24	because they had not executed my judgements, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. 
EZK.20.25	Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgements wherein they should not live; 
EZK.20.26	and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through 
EZK.20.27	Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.28	For when I had brought them into the land, which I lifted up mine hand to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering, there also they made their sweet savour, and they poured out there their drink offerings. 
EZK.20.29	Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. 
EZK.20.30	Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.31	and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.32	and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
EZK.20.33	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.34	and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, 
EZK.20.35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I plead with you face to face. 
EZK.20.36	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; 
EZK.20.38	and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.40	For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.41	As a sweet savour will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. 
EZK.20.42	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. 
EZK.20.44	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.45	And the word of the 
EZK.20.46	Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop 
EZK.20.47	and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of the 
EZK.20.48	And all flesh shall see that I the 
EZK.20.49	Then said I, Ah Lord 
EZK.21.1	And the word of the 
EZK.21.2	Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop 
EZK.21.3	and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the 
EZK.21.4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: 
EZK.21.5	and all flesh shall know that I the 
EZK.21.6	Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes. 
EZK.21.7	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord 
EZK.21.8	And the word of the 
EZK.21.9	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the 
EZK.21.10	it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree. 
EZK.21.11	And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. 
EZK.21.12	Cry and howl, son of man: for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh. 
EZK.21.13	For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord 
EZK.21.14	Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers. 
EZK.21.15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter. 
EZK.21.16	Gather thee together, go to the right; set thyself in array, go to the left; whithersoever thy face is set. 
EZK.21.17	I will also smite mine hands together, and I will satisfy my fury: I the 
EZK.21.18	The word of the 
EZK.21.19	Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city. 
EZK.21.20	Thou shalt appoint a way, for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. 
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver. 
EZK.21.22	In his right hand was the divination 
EZK.21.23	And it shall be unto them as a vain divination in their sight, which have sworn oaths unto them: but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken. 
EZK.21.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.25	And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end; 
EZK.21.26	thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it 
EZK.21.28	And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.29	whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end. 
EZK.21.30	Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee. 
EZK.21.31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath: and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy. 
EZK.21.32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the 
EZK.22.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.22.2	And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations. 
EZK.22.3	And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries. 
EZK.22.5	Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one 
EZK.22.6	Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood. 
EZK.22.7	In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee, have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow. 
EZK.22.8	Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. 
EZK.22.9	Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood: and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness. 
EZK.22.10	In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her separation. 
EZK.22.11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. 
EZK.22.12	In thee have they taken bribes to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by oppression, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord 
EZK.22.13	Behold, therefore, I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. 
EZK.22.14	Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the 
EZK.22.15	And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee. 
EZK.22.16	And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.22.17	And the word of the 
EZK.22.18	Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver. 
EZK.22.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.20	As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will lay you there, and melt you. 
EZK.22.21	Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shalt be melted in the midst thereof. 
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.22.23	And the word of the 
EZK.22.24	Son of man, say unto her, thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. 
EZK.22.25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof. 
EZK.22.26	Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. 
EZK.22.27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey; to shed blood, 
EZK.22.28	And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered 
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 
EZK.22.30	And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the fence, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. 
EZK.22.31	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord 
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
EZK.23.3	and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
EZK.23.4	And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. 
EZK.23.5	And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians 
EZK.23.6	which were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
EZK.23.7	And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them: and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself. 
EZK.23.8	Neither hath, she left her whoredoms since 
EZK.23.9	Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
EZK.23.10	These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgements upon her.
EZK.23.11	And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister. 
EZK.23.12	She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, 
EZK.23.13	And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way. 
EZK.23.14	And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, 
EZK.23.15	girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity. 
EZK.23.16	And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love; and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them. 
EZK.23.18	So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
EZK.23.21	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the bruising of thy teats by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.
EZK.23.22	Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, 
EZK.23.24	And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with an assembly of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will commit the judgement unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgements. 
EZK.23.25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 
EZK.23.26	They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. 
EZK.23.27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom 
EZK.23.28	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.29	and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
EZK.23.30	These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. 
EZK.23.32	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
EZK.23.34	Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through 
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. 
EZK.23.40	And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far: unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thine eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments; 
EZK.23.41	and satest upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil. 
EZK.23.42	And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them 
EZK.23.43	Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they commit whoredoms with her, and she 
EZK.23.44	And they went in unto her, as they go in unto an harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women. 
EZK.23.45	And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgement of adulteresses, and with the judgement of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 
EZK.23.46	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.47	And the assembly shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
EZK.23.48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. 
EZK.23.49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.24.1	Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth 
EZK.24.2	Son of man, write thee the name of the day, 
EZK.24.3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.4	gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones. 
EZK.24.5	Take the choice of the flock, and pile also the bones under it: make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be seethed in the midst of it. 
EZK.24.6	Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 
EZK.24.8	That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered. 
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.10	Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned. 
EZK.24.11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed. 
EZK.24.12	She hath wearied 
EZK.24.13	In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have satisfied my fury upon thee. 
EZK.24.14	I the 
EZK.24.15	Also the word of the 
EZK.24.16	Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. 
EZK.24.17	Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead, bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. 
EZK.24.18	So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died: and I did in the morning as I was commanded. 
EZK.24.19	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? 
EZK.24.20	Then I said unto them, The word of the 
EZK.24.21	Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.22	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men. 
EZK.24.23	And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another. 
EZK.24.24	Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord 
EZK.24.25	And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters, 
EZK.24.26	that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears? 
EZK.24.27	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.1	And the word of the 
EZK.25.2	Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them: 
EZK.25.3	and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.25.4	therefore behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 
EZK.25.5	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.6	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.7	therefore behold, I have stretched out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.25.8	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.9	therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 
EZK.25.10	unto the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon, and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations: 
EZK.25.11	and I will execute judgements upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.12	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.13	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury: and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord 
EZK.25.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.16	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.26.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first 
EZK.26.2	Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken 
EZK.26.3	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock. 
EZK.26.5	She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.26.6	And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mount against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee. 
EZK.26.9	And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. 
EZK.26.10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. 
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people with the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground. 
EZK.26.12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters. 
EZK.26.13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. 
EZK.26.14	And I will make thee a bare rock: thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I the 
EZK.26.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee. 
EZK.26.17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which caused their terror to be on all that haunt it! 
EZK.26.18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure. 
EZK.26.19	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.20	then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living: 
EZK.26.21	I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord 
EZK.27.1	The word of the 
EZK.27.2	And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre; 
EZK.27.3	and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, which art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.27.4	Thy borders are in the heart of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. 
EZK.27.5	They have made all thy planks of fir trees from Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make a mast for thee. 
EZK.27.6	Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim. 
EZK.27.7	Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning. 
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots. 
EZK.27.9	The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. 
EZK.27.10	Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. 
EZK.27.11	The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty. 
EZK.27.12	Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares. 
EZK.27.13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise. 
EZK.27.14	They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules. 
EZK.27.15	The men of Dedan were thy traffickers: many isles were the mart of thine hand: they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony. 
EZK.27.16	Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handyworks: they traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies. 
EZK.27.17	Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm: 
EZK.27.18	Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handyworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 
EZK.27.19	Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise. 
EZK.27.20	Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding. 
EZK.27.21	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants. 
EZK.27.22	The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy wares with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 
EZK.27.23	Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur 
EZK.27.24	These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. 
EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.
EZK.27.26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas. 
EZK.27.27	Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin. 
EZK.27.28	At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake. 
EZK.27.29	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, 
EZK.27.30	and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: 
EZK.27.31	and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning. 
EZK.27.32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, 
EZK.27.33	When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 
EZK.27.34	In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee. 
EZK.27.35	All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid, they are troubled in their countenance. 
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.
EZK.28.1	The word of the 
EZK.28.2	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.3	behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee: 
EZK.28.4	by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 
EZK.28.5	by thy great wisdom 
EZK.28.6	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.7	therefore behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. 
EZK.28.8	They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas. 
EZK.28.9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee. 
EZK.28.10	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.28.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.28.12	Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.13	Thou wast in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared. 
EZK.28.14	Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, 
EZK.28.15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee. 
EZK.28.16	By the multitude of they traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore, have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
EZK.28.17	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground, I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 
EZK.28.18	By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee, it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 
EZK.28.19	All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.
EZK.28.20	And the word of the 
EZK.28.21	Son of man, set thy face toward Zidon, and prophesy against it, 
EZK.28.22	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.23	For I will send into her pestilence and blood in her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.28.24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a grieving thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.28.25	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.26	And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely; when I have executed judgements upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.1	In the tenth year, in the tenth 
EZK.29.2	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: 
EZK.29.3	speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.4	And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales. 
EZK.29.5	And I will leave thee 
EZK.29.6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.9	And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.10	therefore behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia. 
EZK.29.11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 
EZK.29.12	And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
EZK.29.13	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.14	and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 
EZK.29.15	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 
EZK.29.16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.29.17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first 
EZK.29.18	Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it: 
EZK.29.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.20	I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompence for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord 
EZK.29.21	In that day will I cause an horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.1	The word of the 
EZK.30.2	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.3	For the day is near, even the day of the 
EZK.30.4	And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. 
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. 
EZK.30.6	Thus saith the 
EZK.30.7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. 
EZK.30.8	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.9	In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. 
EZK.30.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. 
EZK.30.12	And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the 
EZK.30.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.14	And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgements in No. 
EZK.30.15	And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strong hold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. 
EZK.30.16	And I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up: and Noph 
EZK.30.17	The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these 
EZK.30.18	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. 
EZK.30.19	Thus will I execute judgements in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first 
EZK.30.21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up to apply 
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
EZK.30.24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. 
EZK.30.25	And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.31.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third 
EZK.31.2	Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
EZK.31.3	Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. 
EZK.31.4	The waters nourished him, the deep made him to grow: her rivers ran round about her plantation; and she sent out her channels unto all the trees of the field. 
EZK.31.5	Therefore his stature was exalted above all the trees of the field: and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long by reason of many waters, when he shot 
EZK.31.6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. 
EZK.31.7	Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by many waters. 
EZK.31.8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the plane trees were not as his branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto him in his beauty. 
EZK.31.9	I made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus said the Lord 
EZK.31.11	I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness. 
EZK.31.12	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. 
EZK.31.13	Upon his ruin all the fowls of the heaven shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 
EZK.31.14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up in their height, 
EZK.31.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth. 
EZK.31.17	They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, 
EZK.31.18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first 
EZK.32.2	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a dragon in the seas; and thou brakest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. 
EZK.32.3	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.32.4	And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee. 
EZK.32.5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. 
EZK.32.6	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee. 
EZK.32.7	And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. 
EZK.32.8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.9	I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. 
EZK.32.10	Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. 
EZK.32.11	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.32.12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall spoil the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. 
EZK.32.13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. 
EZK.32.14	Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith: for Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth 
EZK.32.18	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. 
EZK.32.19	Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. 
EZK.32.20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her away and all her multitudes. 
EZK.32.21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword. 
EZK.32.22	Asshur is there and all her company; his graves are round about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword: 
EZK.32.23	whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living. 
EZK.32.24	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. 
EZK.32.25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain. 
EZK.32.26	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about her: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living. 
EZK.32.27	And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for 
EZK.32.28	But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword. 
EZK.32.29	There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, which in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. 
EZK.32.30	There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are ashamed; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. 
EZK.32.31	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude: even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.32	For I have put his terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord 
EZK.33.1	And the word of the 
EZK.33.2	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman: 
EZK.33.3	if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
EZK.33.4	then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him: whereas if he had taken warning he should have delivered his soul. 
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. 
EZK.33.7	So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
EZK.33.8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
EZK.33.9	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.33.10	And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then should we live? 
EZK.33.11	Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.33.12	And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness: neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. 
EZK.33.13	When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die. 
EZK.33.14	Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 
EZK.33.15	if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. 
EZK.33.17	Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. 
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein. 
EZK.33.19	And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. 
EZK.33.20	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
EZK.33.21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth 
EZK.33.22	Now the hand of the 
EZK.33.23	And the word of the 
EZK.33.24	Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. 
EZK.33.25	Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.33.26	Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land? 
EZK.33.27	Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.33.28	And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment, and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. 
EZK.33.29	Then shall they know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the 
EZK.33.31	And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their gain. 
EZK.33.32	And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. 
EZK.33.33	And when this cometh to pass, (behold, it cometh,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
EZK.34.1	And the word of the 
EZK.34.2	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.3	Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep. 
EZK.34.4	The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigour have ye ruled over them. 
EZK.34.5	And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered. 
EZK.34.6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and there was none that did search or seek 
EZK.34.7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.8	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.34.9	therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.11	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. 
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them with good pasture, and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I myself will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord 
EZK.34.16	I will seek that which was lost, and will bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: and the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in judgement.
EZK.34.17	And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.18	Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? 
EZK.34.19	And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. 
EZK.34.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.21	Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; 
EZK.34.22	therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. 
EZK.34.23	And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. 
EZK.34.24	And I the 
EZK.34.25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
EZK.34.26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing. 
EZK.34.27	And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid. 
EZK.34.29	And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. 
EZK.34.30	And they shall know that I the 
EZK.34.31	And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord 
EZK.35.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.35.2	Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
EZK.35.3	and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.35.4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end: 
EZK.35.6	therefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.35.7	Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth. 
EZK.35.8	And I will fill his mountains with his slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 
EZK.35.9	I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the 
EZK.35.11	therefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.35.12	And thou shalt know that I the 
EZK.35.13	And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it. 
EZK.35.14	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.35.15	As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the 
EZK.36.2	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.3	therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.4	therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.36.5	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.6	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.7	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.8	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come. 
EZK.36.9	For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown: 
EZK.36.10	and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded: 
EZK.36.11	and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase, and be fruitful: and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better 
EZK.36.12	Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children. 
EZK.36.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord 
EZK.36.15	neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the heathen, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord 
EZK.36.16	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.36.17	Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation. 
EZK.36.18	Wherefore I poured out my fury upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols: 
EZK.36.19	and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. 
EZK.36.20	And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of the 
EZK.36.21	But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went. 
EZK.36.22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.23	And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.24	For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
EZK.36.25	And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. 
EZK.36.26	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you art heart of flesh. 
EZK.36.27	And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them. 
EZK.36.28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you. 
EZK.36.30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. 
EZK.36.31	Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
EZK.36.32	Not for your sake do I 
EZK.36.33	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.34	And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by. 
EZK.36.35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fenced and inhabited. 
EZK.36.36	Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the 
EZK.36.37	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.38	As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.1	The hand of the 
EZK.37.2	And he caused me to pass by them round about: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and lo, they were very dry. 
EZK.37.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord 
EZK.37.4	Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the 
EZK.37.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.6	And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold an earthquake, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 
EZK.37.8	And I beheld, and lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. 
EZK.37.9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.10	So I prophesied as he commanded me; and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 
EZK.37.11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. 
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.13	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.14	And I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.37.15	The word of the 
EZK.37.16	And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and 
EZK.37.17	and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thine hand. 
EZK.37.18	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? 
EZK.37.19	say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. 
EZK.37.21	And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.22	and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: 
EZK.37.23	neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.37.24	And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgements, and observe my statutes, and do them. 
EZK.37.25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. 
EZK.37.26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
EZK.37.27	My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
EZK.37.28	And the nations shall know that I am the 
EZK.38.1	And the word of the 
EZK.38.2	Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 
EZK.38.3	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.4	and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armour, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords: 
EZK.38.5	Persia, Cush, and Put with them; all of them with shield and helmet: 
EZK.38.6	Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes: even many peoples with thee. 
EZK.38.7	Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them. 
EZK.38.8	After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste: but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them. 
EZK.38.9	And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee. 
EZK.38.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.11	and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at quiet, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates: 
EZK.38.12	to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thine hand against the waste places that are 
EZK.38.13	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish; with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?
EZK.38.14	Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses; a great company and a mighty army: 
EZK.38.16	and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. 
EZK.38.17	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.38.19	For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
EZK.38.20	so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 
EZK.38.21	And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord 
EZK.38.22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood: and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. 
EZK.38.23	And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.1	And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.2	and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 
EZK.39.3	and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 
EZK.39.4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. 
EZK.39.5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.8	Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years, 
EZK.39.10	so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea: and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog. 
EZK.39.12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.13	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown, in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.14	And they shall sever out men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land to bury them that pass through, that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search. 
EZK.39.15	And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. 
EZK.39.16	And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.17	And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
EZK.39.19	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. 
EZK.39.20	And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.21	And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgement that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. 
EZK.39.22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword. 
EZK.39.24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them. 
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.26	And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid; 
EZK.39.27	when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. 
EZK.39.28	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.29	neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.40.1	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth 
EZK.40.2	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south. 
EZK.40.3	And he brought me thither, and behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
EZK.40.4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
EZK.40.5	And behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long, of a cubit and an handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
EZK.40.6	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof; and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad: and the other threshold, one reed broad. 
EZK.40.7	And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and 
EZK.40.8	He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. 
EZK.40.9	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. 
EZK.40.10	And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
EZK.40.11	And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate thirteen cubits; 
EZK.40.12	and a border before the lodges one cubit 
EZK.40.13	And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door. 
EZK.40.14	He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court 
EZK.40.15	And 
EZK.40.16	And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon 
EZK.40.17	Then brought he me into the outer court, and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits, 
EZK.40.20	And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof. 
EZK.40.21	And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
EZK.40.22	And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them. 
EZK.40.23	And there was a gate to the inner court over against the 
EZK.40.24	And he led me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. 
EZK.40.25	And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
EZK.40.26	And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
EZK.40.27	And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits. 
EZK.40.28	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; 
EZK.40.29	and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof; according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
EZK.40.30	And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 
EZK.40.31	And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
EZK.40.32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures; 
EZK.40.33	and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
EZK.40.34	And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
EZK.40.35	And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured 
EZK.40.36	the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof; and there were windows therein round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
EZK.40.37	And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
EZK.40.38	And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt offering.
EZK.40.39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering. 
EZK.40.40	And on the 
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew 
EZK.40.42	And there were four tables for the burnt offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
EZK.40.43	And the hooks, an handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation. 
EZK.40.44	And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. 
EZK.40.45	And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house, 
EZK.40.46	and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, which from among the sons of Levi come near to the 
EZK.40.47	And he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house. 
EZK.40.48	Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. 
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
EZK.41.1	And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. 
EZK.41.2	And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. 
EZK.41.3	Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits: and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits. 
EZK.41.4	And he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. 
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. 
EZK.41.6	And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold 
EZK.41.7	And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed 
EZK.41.8	I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house. 
EZK.41.10	And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
EZK.41.11	And the doors of the side-chambers were toward 
EZK.41.12	And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. 
EZK.41.13	So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long, and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; 
EZK.41.14	also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. 
EZK.41.15	And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court; 
EZK.41.16	the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, cieled with wood round about, and 
EZK.41.17	to 
EZK.41.18	And it was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; 
EZK.41.19	so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: 
EZK.41.20	from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple. 
EZK.41.21	As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance 
EZK.41.22	The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the 
EZK.41.23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
EZK.41.24	And the doors had two leaves 
EZK.41.25	And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick beams of wood upon the face of the porch without. 
EZK.41.26	And there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thick beams.
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north. 
EZK.42.2	Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. 
EZK.42.3	Over against the twenty 
EZK.42.4	And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north. 
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building. 
EZK.42.6	For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore 
EZK.42.7	And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. 
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. 
EZK.42.9	And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court. 
EZK.42.10	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers. 
EZK.42.11	And the way before them was like the appearance of 
EZK.42.12	And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. 
EZK.42.13	Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.
EZK.42.15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. 
EZK.42.16	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
EZK.42.17	He measured on the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
EZK.42.18	He measured on the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.20	He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: 
EZK.43.2	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. 
EZK.43.3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar: and I fell upon my face. 
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	And the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.
EZK.43.7	And he said unto me, Son of man, 
EZK.43.8	in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post beside my door post, and there was 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. 
EZK.43.10	Thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern. 
EZK.43.11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof, and write it in their sight: that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. 
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
EZK.43.13	And these are the measures of the altar by cubits: (the cubit is a cubit and an handbreadth:) the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span: and this shall be the base of the altar. 
EZK.43.14	And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit. 
EZK.43.15	And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns. 
EZK.43.16	And the altar hearth shall be twelve 
EZK.43.17	And the settle shall be fourteen 
EZK.43.18	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.43.19	Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord 
EZK.43.20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it. 
EZK.43.21	Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
EZK.43.22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. 
EZK.43.23	When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 
EZK.43.24	And thou shalt bring them near before the 
EZK.43.25	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. 
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it. 
EZK.43.27	And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. 
EZK.44.2	And the 
EZK.44.3	As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before the 
EZK.44.4	Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.44.7	in that ye have brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, 
EZK.44.8	And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. 
EZK.44.9	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.44.10	But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray from me after their idols; they shall bear their iniquity. 
EZK.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. 
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. 
EZK.44.14	Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. 
EZK.44.15	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.16	they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
EZK.44.17	And it shall be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. 
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with 
EZK.44.19	And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments. 
EZK.44.20	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. 
EZK.44.21	Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. 
EZK.44.22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest. 
EZK.44.23	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. 
EZK.44.24	And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my judgements shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. 
EZK.44.25	And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 
EZK.44.26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 
EZK.44.27	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.28	And they shall have an inheritance; I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession. 
EZK.44.29	They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	And the first of all the firstfruits of every thing, and every oblation of every thing, of all your oblations, shall be for the priests: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thine house. 
EZK.44.31	The priests shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
EZK.45.1	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the 
EZK.45.2	Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred 
EZK.45.3	And of this measure shalt thou measure, a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. 
EZK.45.4	It is an holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, which come near to minister unto the 
EZK.45.5	And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, 
EZK.45.6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel. 
EZK.45.7	And 
EZK.45.8	In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
EZK.45.9	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.45.10	Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. 
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. 
EZK.45.12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
EZK.45.13	This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah from an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from an homer of barley: 
EZK.45.14	and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, shall be the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, 
EZK.45.15	and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the fat pastures of Israel; for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord 
EZK.45.16	All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel. 
EZK.45.17	And it shall be the prince's part to give the burnt offerings, and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meal offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel. 
EZK.45.18	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.45.19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the door posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
EZK.45.20	And so thou shalt do on the seventh 
EZK.45.21	In the first 
EZK.45.22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering. 
EZK.45.23	And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	And he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.45.25	In the seventh 
EZK.46.1	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.46.2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate; then he shall go forth: but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 
EZK.46.3	And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before the 
EZK.46.4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the 
EZK.46.5	and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.6	And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish; and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish: 
EZK.46.7	and he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. 
EZK.46.9	But when the people of the land shall come before the 
EZK.46.10	And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth 
EZK.46.11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.12	And when the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering unto the 
EZK.46.13	And thou shalt prepare a lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering unto the 
EZK.46.14	And thou shalt prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering unto the 
EZK.46.15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.
EZK.46.16	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.46.17	But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. 
EZK.46.18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
EZK.46.19	Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward. 
EZK.46.20	And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meal offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people. 
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty 
EZK.46.23	And there was a row 
EZK.46.24	Then said he unto me, These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
EZK.47.1	And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house was toward the east: and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. 
EZK.47.2	Then brought he me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of 
EZK.47.3	When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. 
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through 
EZK.47.5	Afterward he measured a thousand; 
EZK.47.6	And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen 
EZK.47.7	Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. 
EZK.47.8	Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah: and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea 
EZK.47.9	And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish: for these waters are come thither, and 
EZK.47.10	And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. 
EZK.47.11	But the miry places thereof, and the marishes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt. 
EZK.47.12	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for meat, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for healing.
EZK.47.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.47.14	And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. 
EZK.47.15	And this shall be the border of the land: on the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entering in of Zedad; 
EZK.47.16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. 
EZK.47.18	And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be Jordan; from the 
EZK.47.19	And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook 
EZK.47.20	And the west side shall be the great sea, from the 
EZK.47.21	So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the homeborn among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth; there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord 
EZK.48.1	Now these are the names of the tribes: from the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entering in of Hamath, Hazer-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath; and they shall have their sides east 
EZK.48.2	And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side; Asher, one 
EZK.48.3	And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side; Naphtali, one 
EZK.48.4	And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side; Manasseh, one 
EZK.48.5	And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side; Ephraim, one 
EZK.48.6	And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side; Reuben, one 
EZK.48.7	And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side; Judah, 
EZK.48.8	And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand 
EZK.48.9	The oblation that ye shall offer unto the 
EZK.48.10	And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand 
EZK.48.11	 for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, which have kept my charge; which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
EZK.48.12	And it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites. 
EZK.48.13	And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. 
EZK.48.14	And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange it, nor shall the firstfruits of the land be alienated: for it is holy unto the 
EZK.48.15	And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof. 
EZK.48.16	And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred; and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
EZK.48.17	And the city shall have suburbs; toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 
EZK.48.18	And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be answerable unto the holy oblation; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that labour in the city. 
EZK.48.19	And they that labour in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. 
EZK.48.20	All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city. 
EZK.48.21	And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. 
EZK.48.22	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince. 
EZK.48.23	And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side; Benjamin, one 
EZK.48.24	And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side; Simeon, one 
EZK.48.25	And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side; Issachar, one 
EZK.48.26	And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side; Zebulun, one 
EZK.48.27	And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side; Gad, one 
EZK.48.28	And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook 
EZK.48.29	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, saith the Lord 
EZK.48.30	And these are the goings out of the city; on the north side four thousand and five hundred 
EZK.48.31	and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one: 
EZK.48.32	And at the east side four thousand and five hundred 
EZK.48.33	And at the south side four thousand and five hundred 
EZK.48.34	At the west side four thousand and five hundred 
EZK.48.35	It shall be eighteen thousand 
DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. 
DAN.1.3	And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in 
DAN.1.4	youths in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 
DAN.1.5	And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 
DAN.1.6	Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave 
DAN.1.8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
DAN.1.9	Now God made Daniel to find favour and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. 
DAN.1.10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Darnel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths which are of your own age? so should ye endanger my head with the king. 
DAN.1.11	Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
DAN.1.12	Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's meat; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 
DAN.1.14	So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths which did eat of the king's meat. 
DAN.1.16	So the steward took away their meat, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.
DAN.1.17	Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 
DAN.1.18	And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. 
DAN.1.20	And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm. 
DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. 
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. 
DAN.2.3	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream. 
DAN.2.4	Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. 
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 
DAN.2.6	But if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereof. 
DAN.2.7	They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. 
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, I know of a certain that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. 
DAN.2.9	But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. 
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: forasmuch as no king, lord, nor ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. 
DAN.2.11	And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. 
DAN.2.12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; 
DAN.2.15	he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
DAN.2.16	And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would shew the king the interpretation. 
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
DAN.2.18	that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.19	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: 
DAN.2.21	And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: 
DAN.2.22	he revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. 
DAN.2.23	I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee: for thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. 
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. 
DAN.2.26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, shew unto the king; 
DAN.2.28	but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: 
DAN.2.29	as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
DAN.2.31	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible. 
DAN.2.32	As for this image, his head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 
DAN.2.33	his legs of iron, his feet part of iron, and part of clay. 
DAN.2.34	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces. 
DAN.2.35	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. 
DAN.2.36	This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. 
DAN.2.37	Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; 
DAN.2.38	and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold. 
DAN.2.39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 
DAN.2.40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. 
DAN.2.41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 
DAN.2.42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. 
DAN.2.43	And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. 
DAN.2.44	And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. 
DAN.2.45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
DAN.2.46	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. 
DAN.2.47	The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, sing thou hast been able to reveal this secret. 
DAN.2.48	Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
DAN.3.3	Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	Then the herald cried aloud, to you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, 
DAN.3.5	that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: 
DAN.3.6	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
DAN.3.8	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever. 
DAN.3.10	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image: 
DAN.3.11	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter. 
DAN.3.17	If it be 
DAN.3.18	But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
DAN.3.19	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: 
DAN.3.20	And he commanded certain mighty men that were in is army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their 
DAN.3.22	Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. 
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. 
DAN.3.25	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods. 
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dung-hill: because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort. 
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; peace be multiplied unto you. 
DAN.4.2	It hath seemed good unto me to shew the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me. 
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid; the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
DAN.4.6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. 
DAN.4.7	Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 
DAN.4.8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, 
DAN.4.9	O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. 
DAN.4.10	Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. 
DAN.4.12	The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. 
DAN.4.13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven. 
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches. 
DAN.4.15	Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 
DAN.4.16	let his heart be changed from man's and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. 
DAN.4.17	The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men. 
DAN.4.18	This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen: and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. 
DAN.4.20	The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; 
DAN.4.21	whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 
DAN.4.22	it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. 
DAN.4.23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; 
DAN.4.24	this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king: 
DAN.4.25	that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. 
DAN.4.26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. 
DAN.4.27	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
DAN.4.28	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty? 
DAN.4.31	While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, 
DAN.4.32	and thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. 
DAN.4.33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles' 
DAN.4.34	And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation: 
DAN.4.35	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? 
DAN.4.36	At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me. 
DAN.4.37	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways judgement: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therein. 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank in them. 
DAN.5.4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 
DAN.5.5	In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. 
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.8	Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation. 
DAN.5.9	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
DAN.5.11	There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him: and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, 
DAN.5.12	forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. 
DAN.5.13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. 
DAN.5.15	And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing. 
DAN.5.16	But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 
DAN.5.18	O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty: 
DAN.5.19	and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 
DAN.5.21	and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will. 
DAN.5.22	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; 
DAN.5.23	but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: 
DAN.5.24	Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed. 
DAN.5.25	And this is the writing that was inscribed, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end. 
DAN.5.27	TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 
DAN.5.28	PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 
DAN.5.29	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain. 
DAN.5.31	And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty satraps, which should be throughout the whole kingdom; 
DAN.6.2	and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage. 
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. 
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. 
DAN.6.5	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
DAN.6.6	Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. 
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
DAN.6.9	Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict. 
DAN.6.10	And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem;) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. 
DAN.6.12	Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's interdict; Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
DAN.6.13	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. 
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to rescue him. 
DAN.6.15	Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. 
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. 
DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him. 
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 
DAN.6.20	And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice: the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? 
DAN.6.21	Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
DAN.6.22	My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. 
DAN.6.23	Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God. 
DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, or ever they came at the bottom of the den.
DAN.6.25	Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
DAN.6.26	I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end: 
DAN.6.27	He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth; who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. 
DAN.7.2	Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven brake forth upon the great sea. 
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. 
DAN.7.4	The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. 
DAN.7.5	And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in his mouth between his teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. 
DAN.7.6	After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. 
DAN.7.7	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
DAN.7.8	I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
DAN.7.9	I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, 
DAN.7.10	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgement was set, and the books were opened. 
DAN.7.11	I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and he was given to be burned with fire. 
DAN.7.12	And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 
DAN.7.13	I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. 
DAN.7.14	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
DAN.7.16	I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
DAN.7.17	These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. 
DAN.7.19	Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; 
DAN.7.20	and concerning the ten horns that were on his head, and the other 
DAN.7.21	I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 
DAN.7.22	until the ancient of days came, and judgement was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. 
DAN.7.23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
DAN.7.24	And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. 
DAN.7.25	And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High: and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. 
DAN.7.26	But the judgement shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. 
DAN.7.27	And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. 
DAN.7.28	Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. 
DAN.8.2	And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. 
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. 
DAN.8.5	And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
DAN.8.6	And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. 
DAN.8.7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him: but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
DAN.8.8	And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable 
DAN.8.9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious 
DAN.8.10	And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. 
DAN.8.11	Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual 
DAN.8.12	And the host was given over 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one which spake, How long shall be the vision 
DAN.8.14	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings 
DAN.8.15	And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man's voice between 
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. 
DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
DAN.8.19	And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation: for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. 
DAN.8.20	The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 
DAN.8.22	And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. 
DAN.8.23	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. 
DAN.8.24	And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do 
DAN.8.25	And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in 
DAN.8.26	And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days 
DAN.8.27	And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by the books the number of the years, whereof the word of the 
DAN.9.3	And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.
DAN.9.4	And I prayed unto the 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thy judgements: 
DAN.9.6	neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
DAN.9.7	O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. 
DAN.9.8	O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses; for we have rebelled against him; 
DAN.9.10	neither have we obeyed the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him. 
DAN.9.12	And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favour of the 
DAN.9.14	Therefore hath the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 
DAN.9.16	O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy fury, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us. 
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. 
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. 
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not; for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
DAN.9.20	And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the 
DAN.9.21	yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. 
DAN.9.22	And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding. 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision. 
DAN.9.24	Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy. 
DAN.9.25	Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks: and threescore and two weeks, it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times. 
DAN.9.26	And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and his end shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined. 
DAN.9.27	And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and for the half of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations 
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. 
DAN.10.2	In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. 
DAN.10.4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, 
DAN.10.5	I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz: 
DAN.10.6	his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 
DAN.10.7	And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. 
DAN.10.9	Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.
DAN.10.10	And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 
DAN.10.11	And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent: and when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. 
DAN.10.12	Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and, to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words' sake. 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for the vision is yet for 
DAN.10.15	and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. 
DAN.10.16	And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength. 
DAN.10.17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me. 
DAN.10.18	Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me. 
DAN.10.19	And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. 
DAN.10.20	Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come. 
DAN.10.21	But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.
DAN.11.1	And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him. 
DAN.11.2	And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. 
DAN.11.4	And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside these.
DAN.11.5	And the king of the south shall be strong, and 
DAN.11.6	And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times. 
DAN.11.7	But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, which shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail: 
DAN.11.8	And also their gods, with their molten images, 
DAN.11.9	And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land. 
DAN.11.10	And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through: and they shall return and war, even to his fortress. 
DAN.11.11	And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand. 
DAN.11.12	And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted: and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail. 
DAN.11.13	And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, 
DAN.11.14	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall. 
DAN.11.15	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take a well fenced city: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand. 
DAN.11.16	But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction. 
DAN.11.17	And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; and he shall do 
DAN.11.18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him. 
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found. 
DAN.11.20	Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
DAN.11.21	And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 
DAN.11.22	And with the arms of a flood shall they be swept away from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. 
DAN.11.23	And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people. 
DAN.11.24	In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strong holds, even for a time. 
DAN.11.25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army: but he shall not stand, for they shall devise devices against him. 
DAN.11.26	Yea, they that eat of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain. 
DAN.11.27	And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. 
DAN.11.28	Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart 
DAN.11.29	At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former. 
DAN.11.30	For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do 
DAN.11.31	And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual 
DAN.11.32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries: but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do 
DAN.11.33	And they that be wise among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, 
DAN.11.34	Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries. 
DAN.11.35	And some of them that be wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for the time appointed. 
DAN.11.36	And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods: and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done. 
DAN.11.37	Neither shall he regard the gods his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. 
DAN.11.38	But in his place shall he honour the god of fortresses: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. 
DAN.11.39	And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a strange god; whosoever acknowledgeth 
DAN.11.40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through. 
DAN.11.41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many 
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 
DAN.11.43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. 
DAN.11.44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many. 
DAN.11.45	And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
DAN.12.1	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. 
DAN.12.2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. 
DAN.12.3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. 
DAN.12.4	But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
DAN.12.5	Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side. 
DAN.12.6	And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? 
DAN.12.7	And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth fear ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. 
DAN.12.8	And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things? 
DAN.12.9	And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many shall purify themselves; and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand: but they that be wise shall understand. 
DAN.12.11	And from the time that the continual 
DAN.12.12	Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. 
DAN.12.13	But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot, at the end of the days.
HOS.1.1	The word of the 
HOS.1.2	When the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son. 
HOS.1.4	And the 
HOS.1.5	And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And 
HOS.1.7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the 
HOS.1.8	Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. 
HOS.1.9	And 
HOS.1.10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, 
HOS.1.11	And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
HOS.2.1	Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. 
HOS.2.2	Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
HOS.2.3	lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst; 
HOS.2.4	Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they be children of whoredom, 
HOS.2.5	for their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
HOS.2.6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will make a fence against her, that she shall not find her paths. 
HOS.2.7	And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now. 
HOS.2.8	For she did not know that I gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. 
HOS.2.9	Therefore will I take back my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. 
HOS.2.10	And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. 
HOS.2.11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. 
HOS.2.12	And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. 
HOS.2.13	And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense; when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. 
HOS.2.15	And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
HOS.2.16	And it shall be at that day, saith the 
HOS.2.17	For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name. 
HOS.2.18	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely. 
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgement, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. 
HOS.2.20	I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the 
HOS.2.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith the 
HOS.2.22	and the earth shall answer the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel. 
HOS.2.23	And I wilt sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, 
HOS.3.1	And the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her to me for fifteen 
HOS.3.3	and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man's wife: so will I also be toward thee. 
HOS.3.4	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim, 
HOS.3.5	afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.2	There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood. 
HOS.4.3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. 
HOS.4.4	Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. 
HOS.4.5	And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children. 
HOS.4.7	As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame. 
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity. 
HOS.4.9	And it shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and will reward them their doings. 
HOS.4.10	And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the 
HOS.4.11	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.
HOS.4.12	My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. 
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your brides commit adultery. 
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for they themselves go apart with whores, and they sacrifice with the harlots: and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown. 
HOS.4.15	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As the 
HOS.4.16	For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will the 
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone. 
HOS.4.18	Their drink is become sour: they commit whoredom continually; her rulers dearly love shame. 
HOS.4.19	The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertain the judgement; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
HOS.5.2	And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all. 
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom, Israel is defiled. 
HOS.5.4	Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not the 
HOS.5.5	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them. 
HOS.5.6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
HOS.5.7	They have dealt treacherously against the 
HOS.5.8	Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin. 
HOS.5.9	Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgement; because he was content to walk after the command. 
HOS.5.12	Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. 
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah 
HOS.5.14	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver. 
HOS.5.15	I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.
HOS.6.1	Come, and let us return unto the 
HOS.6.2	After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him. 
HOS.6.3	And let us know, let us follow on to know the 
HOS.6.4	O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away. 
HOS.6.5	Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgements are 
HOS.6.6	For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
HOS.6.7	But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is stained with blood. 
HOS.6.9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness. 
HOS.6.10	In the house of Israel I have seen an horrible thing: there whoredom is 
HOS.6.11	Also, O Judah, there is an harvest appointed for thee, when I bring again the captivity of my people.
HOS.7.1	When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood: and the thief entereth in, 
HOS.7.2	And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face. 
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir 
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. 
HOS.7.6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 
HOS.7.7	They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth 
HOS.7.10	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto the 
HOS.7.11	And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria. 
HOS.7.12	When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven: I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 
HOS.7.13	Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 
HOS.7.14	And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against me. 
HOS.7.15	Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. 
HOS.7.16	They return, but not to 
HOS.8.2	They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee. 
HOS.8.3	Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him. 
HOS.8.4	They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. 
HOS.8.5	He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? 
HOS.8.6	For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God: yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. 
HOS.8.7	For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing corn; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. 
HOS.8.9	For they are gone up to Assyria, 
HOS.8.10	Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of the king of princes. 
HOS.8.11	Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been unto him to sin. 
HOS.8.12	Though I write for him my law in ten thousand 
HOS.8.13	As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but the 
HOS.8.14	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.
HOS.9.1	Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved hire upon every cornfloor. 
HOS.9.2	The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her. 
HOS.9.3	They shall not dwell in the 
HOS.9.4	They shall not pour out wine 
HOS.9.5	What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of the 
HOS.9.6	For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, 
HOS.9.7	The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great. 
HOS.9.8	Ephraim 
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. 
HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.
HOS.9.11	As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception. 
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! 
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer. 
HOS.9.14	Give them, O 
HOS.9.15	All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house: I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters. 
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb. 
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly pillars. 
HOS.10.2	Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he shall smite their altars, he shall spoil their pillars. 
HOS.10.3	Surely now shall they say, We have no king: for we fear not the 
HOS.10.4	They speak 
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 
HOS.10.6	It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 
HOS.10.7	 Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water. 
HOS.10.8	The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
HOS.10.9	O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; that the battle against the children of iniquity should not overtake them in Gibeah. 
HOS.10.10	When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions. 
HOS.10.11	And Ephraim is an heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out 
HOS.10.12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the 
HOS.10.13	Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 
HOS.10.14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. 
HOS.10.15	So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
HOS.11.1	When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 
HOS.11.2	As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 
HOS.11.3	Yet I taught Ephraim to go; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 
HOS.11.4	I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat before them. 
HOS.11.5	He shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. 
HOS.11.6	And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour 
HOS.11.7	And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they call them to 
HOS.11.8	How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? 
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. 
HOS.11.10	They shall walk after the 
HOS.11.11	They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the 
HOS.11.12	Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.3	In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God: 
HOS.12.4	yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us; 
HOS.12.5	even the 
HOS.12.6	Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgement, and wait on thy God continually.
HOS.12.8	And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labours they shall find in me none iniquity that were sin. 
HOS.12.9	But I am the 
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. 
HOS.12.11	Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether vanity; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks: yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field. 
HOS.12.12	And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept 
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet the 
HOS.12.14	Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel: but when he offended in Baal, he died. 
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. 
HOS.13.3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passeth early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. 
HOS.13.4	Yet I am the 
HOS.13.5	I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. 
HOS.13.6	According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me. 
HOS.13.7	Therefore am I unto them as a lion: as a leopard will I watch by the way: 
HOS.13.8	I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart: and there will I devour them like a lion; the wild beast shall tear them.
HOS.13.9	It is thy destruction, O Israel, that 
HOS.13.10	Where now is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? 
HOS.13.11	I have given thee a king in mine anger, and have taken him away in my wrath. 
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store. 
HOS.13.13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children. 
HOS.13.14	I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, where are thy plagues? O grave, where is thy destruction? repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. 
HOS.13.15	Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the breath of the 
HOS.13.16	Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
HOS.14.1	O ISRAEL, return unto the 
HOS.14.2	Take with you words, and return unto the 
HOS.14.3	Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, 
HOS.14.4	I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.. 
HOS.14.5	I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 
HOS.14.6	His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 
HOS.14.7	They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive 
HOS.14.8	Ephraim 
HOS.14.9	Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the 
JOL.1.1	The word of the 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers? 
JOL.1.3	Tell ye your children of it, and 
JOL.1.4	That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. 
JOL.1.5	Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. 
JOL.1.6	For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw teeth of a great lion. 
JOL.1.7	He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
JOL.1.8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 
JOL.1.9	The meal offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the 
JOL.1.10	The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 
JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen, howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished. 
JOL.1.12	The vine is withered, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men. 
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves 
JOL.1.14	Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men 
JOL.1.15	Alas for the day! for the day of the 
JOL.1.16	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, 
JOL.1.17	The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. 
JOL.1.18	How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. 
JOL.1.19	O 
JOL.1.20	Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee: for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the 
JOL.2.2	a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong, there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations. 
JOL.2.3	A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them. 
JOL.2.4	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run. 
JOL.2.5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. 
JOL.2.6	At their presence the peoples are in anguish: all faces are waxed pale. 
JOL.2.7	They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks. 
JOL.2.8	Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path: and they burst through the weapons, and break not off 
JOL.2.9	They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief. 
JOL.2.10	The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble: the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining: 
JOL.2.11	And the 
JOL.2.12	Yet even now, saith the 
JOL.2.13	and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the 
JOL.2.14	Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering unto the 
JOL.2.15	Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: 
JOL.2.16	gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. 
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, the ministers of the 
JOL.2.18	Then was the 
JOL.2.19	And the 
JOL.2.20	but I will remove far off from you the northern 
JOL.2.21	Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the 
JOL.2.22	Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. 
JOL.2.23	Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the 
JOL.2.24	And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. 
JOL.2.25	And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. 
JOL.2.26	And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the 
JOL.2.27	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the 
JOL.2.28	And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: 
JOL.2.29	and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. 
JOL.2.30	And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. 
JOL.2.31	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the 
JOL.3.1	For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
JOL.3.2	I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land, 
JOL.3.3	and they have cast lots for my people: and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. 
JOL.3.4	Yea, and what are ye to me, 
JOL.3.5	Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things; 
JOL.3.6	the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border: 
JOL.3.7	behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head; 
JOL.3.8	and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for the 
JOL.3.9	Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war: stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. 
JOL.3.10	Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. 
JOL.3.11	Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O 
JOL.3.12	Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about. 
JOL.3.13	Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great. 
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. 
JOL.3.16	And the 
JOL.3.17	So shall ye know that I am the 
JOL.3.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the 
JOL.3.19	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. 
JOL.3.20	But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
JOL.3.21	And I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
AMO.1.2	And he said, The 
AMO.1.3	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.4	but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. 
AMO.1.5	And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the 
AMO.1.6	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.7	But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof: 
AMO.1.8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn mine hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord 
AMO.1.9	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.10	but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. 
AMO.1.11	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.12	but I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. 
AMO.1.13	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.14	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbath and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: 
AMO.1.15	and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the 
AMO.2.1	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.2	but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: 
AMO.2.3	and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the 
AMO.2.4	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.5	but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. 
AMO.2.6	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.7	that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go unto the 
AMO.2.8	and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge, and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.
AMO.2.9	Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. 
AMO.2.10	Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 
AMO.2.11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the 
AMO.2.12	But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. 
AMO.2.13	Behold, I will press 
AMO.2.14	And flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: 
AMO.2.15	neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver 
AMO.2.16	and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that the 
AMO.3.2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities. 
AMO.3.3	Shall two walk together, except they have agreed? 
AMO.3.4	Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? 
AMO.3.5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is 
AMO.3.6	Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? shalt evil befall a city, and the 
AMO.3.7	Surely the Lord 
AMO.3.8	The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord 
AMO.3.9	Publish ye in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults are therein, and what oppressions in the midst thereof. 
AMO.3.10	For they know not to do right, saith the 
AMO.3.11	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
AMO.3.12	Thus saith the 
AMO.3.13	Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the Lord 
AMO.3.14	For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. 
AMO.3.15	And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say unto their lords, Bring, and let us drink. 
AMO.4.2	The Lord 
AMO.4.3	And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall cast 
AMO.4.4	Come to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, 
AMO.4.5	and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings and publish them: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord 
AMO.4.6	And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.7	And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. 
AMO.4.8	So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.9	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees hath the palmerworm devoured: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.10	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.11	I have overthrown 
AMO.4.12	Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: 
AMO.4.13	For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth; the 
AMO.5.1	Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel. 
AMO.5.2	The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up. 
AMO.5.3	For thus saith the Lord 
AMO.5.4	For thus saith the 
AMO.5.5	but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought. 
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.7	Ye who turn judgement to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth; 
AMO.5.8	 that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; the 
AMO.5.9	that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress. 
AMO.5.10	They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. 
AMO.5.11	Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof. 
AMO.5.12	For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins; ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate 
AMO.5.13	Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time. 
AMO.5.14	Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the 
AMO.5.15	Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgement in the gate: it may be that the 
AMO.5.16	Therefore thus saith the 
AMO.5.17	And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith the 
AMO.5.18	Woe unto you that desire the day of the 
AMO.5.19	As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. 
AMO.5.20	Shall not the day of the 
AMO.5.21	I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. 
AMO.5.22	Yea, though ye offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. 
AMO.5.23	Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. 
AMO.5.24	But let judgement roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. 
AMO.5.25	Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 
AMO.5.26	Yea, ye have borne Siccuth your king and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. 
AMO.5.27	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the 
AMO.6.1	Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come! 
AMO.6.2	Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border? 
AMO.6.3	Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; 
AMO.6.4	that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; 
AMO.6.5	that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol; that devise for themselves instruments of music, like David; 
AMO.6.6	that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. 
AMO.6.7	Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away.
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.9	And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. 
AMO.6.10	And when a man's uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold thy peace; for we may not make mention of the name of the 
AMO.6.11	For, behold, the 
AMO.6.12	Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow 
AMO.6.13	ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? 
AMO.6.14	For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the 
AMO.7.1	Thus the Lord 
AMO.7.2	And it came to pass that when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord 
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	Thus the Lord 
AMO.7.5	Then said I, O Lord 
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. 
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.9	and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 
AMO.7.11	For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. 
AMO.7.12	Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
AMO.7.13	but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house. 
AMO.7.14	Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a dresser of sycomore trees: 
AMO.7.15	and the 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore hear thou the word of the 
AMO.7.17	therefore thus saith the 
AMO.8.1	Thus the Lord 
AMO.8.2	And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the 
AMO.8.3	And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.4	Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail, 
AMO.8.5	saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat? making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit; 
AMO.8.6	that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat. 
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt. 
AMO.8.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.12	And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the 
AMO.8.13	In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst. 
AMO.8.14	They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy God, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
AMO.9.1	I SAW the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the chapiters, that the thresholds may shake: and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. 
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. 
AMO.9.3	And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them. 
AMO.9.4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. 
AMO.9.5	For the Lord, the 
AMO.9.6	 he that buildeth his chambers in the heaven, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; the 
AMO.9.7	Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord 
AMO.9.9	For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as 
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
AMO.9.11	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; 
AMO.9.12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations, which are called by my name, saith the 
AMO.9.13	Behold, the days come, saith the 
AMO.9.14	And I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
AMO.9.15	And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord 
OBA.1.2	Behold, I have made thee small among the nations: thou art greatly despised. 
OBA.1.3	The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? 
OBA.1.4	Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the 
OBA.1.5	If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not steal till they had enough? if grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? 
OBA.1.6	How are 
OBA.1.7	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; 
OBA.1.8	Shall I not in that day, saith the 
OBA.1.9	And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
OBA.1.10	For the violence done to thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. 
OBA.1.11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. 
OBA.1.12	But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress. 
OBA.1.13	Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither lay ye 
OBA.1.14	And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress. 
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.16	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.
OBA.1.17	But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. 
OBA.1.18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall burn among them, and devour them: and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for the 
OBA.1.19	And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the lowland the Philistines and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria: and Benjamin 
OBA.1.20	And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, which are 
OBA.1.21	And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the 
JON.1.1	Now the word of the 
JON.1.2	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. 
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. 
JON.1.6	So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. 
JON.1.7	And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. 
JON.1.8	Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? 
JON.1.9	And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the 
JON.1.10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. 
JON.1.12	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. 
JON.1.14	Wherefore they cried unto the 
JON.1.15	So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the 
JON.1.17	And the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed unto the 
JON.2.2	And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto the 
JON.2.3	For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all thy waves and thy billows passed over me. 
JON.2.4	And I said, am cast out from before thine eyes; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. 
JON.2.5	The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head. 
JON.2.6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars 
JON.2.7	When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the 
JON.2.8	They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
JON.2.9	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of the 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	And the word of the 
JON.3.2	Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. 
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the 
JON.3.4	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
JON.3.5	And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 
JON.3.6	And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
JON.3.7	And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: 
JON.3.8	but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 
JON.3.9	Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? 
JON.3.10	And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. 
JON.4.2	And he prayed unto the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O 
JON.4.4	And the 
JON.4.5	Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. 
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered. 
JON.4.8	And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. 
JON.4.9	And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry even unto death. 
JON.4.10	And the 
JON.4.11	and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city; wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
MIC.1.1	The word of the 
MIC.1.2	Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord 
MIC.1.3	For, behold, the 
MIC.1.4	And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place. 
MIC.1.5	For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? 
MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, 
MIC.1.7	And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate: for of the hire of an harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of an harlot shall they return.
MIC.1.8	For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the ostriches. 
MIC.1.9	For her wounds are incurable: for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. 
MIC.1.10	Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-Aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust. 
MIC.1.11	Pass ye away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof. 
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good: because evil is come down from the 
MIC.1.13	Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. 
MIC.1.14	Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel. 
MIC.1.15	I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam. 
MIC.1.16	Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
MIC.2.1	Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
MIC.2.2	And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. 
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus saith the 
MIC.2.4	In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, 
MIC.2.5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the 
MIC.2.6	Prophesy ye not, 
MIC.2.7	Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the spirit of the 
MIC.2.8	But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely 
MIC.2.9	The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever. 
MIC.2.10	Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction. 
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, 
MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah: as a flock in the midst of their pasture, they shall make great noise by reason of 
MIC.2.13	The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat: and their king is passed on before them, and the 
MIC.3.1	And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know judgement? 
MIC.3.2	who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
MIC.3.3	who also eat the flesh of my people; and they flay their skin from off them, and break their bones: yea, they chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 
MIC.3.4	Then shall they cry unto the 
MIC.3.5	Thus saith the 
MIC.3.6	Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them. 
MIC.3.7	And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips: for there is no answer of God.
MIC.3.8	But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the 
MIC.3.9	Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor judgement, and pervert all equity. 
MIC.3.10	They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
MIC.3.11	The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the 
MIC.3.12	Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
MIC.4.1	But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.3	and he shall judge between many peoples, and shall reprove strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
MIC.4.4	But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the 
MIC.4.5	For all the peoples will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.6	In that day, saith the 
MIC.4.7	and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the 
MIC.4.8	And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come; yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem. 
MIC.4.9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail? 
MIC.4.10	Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon; there shalt thou be rescued; there shall the 
MIC.4.11	And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see 
MIC.4.12	But they know not the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shalt devote their gain unto the 
MIC.5.1	Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. 
MIC.5.2	But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting. 
MIC.5.3	Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. 
MIC.5.4	And he shall stand, and shall feed 
MIC.5.5	And this 
MIC.5.6	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.
MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from the 
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver. 
MIC.5.9	Let thine hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off. 
MIC.5.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
MIC.5.11	and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strong holds: 
MIC.5.12	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no 
MIC.5.13	and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands, 
MIC.5.14	and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee: and I will destroy thy cities. 
MIC.5.15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations which hearkened not.
MIC.6.1	Hear ye now what the 
MIC.6.2	Hear, O ye mountains, the 
MIC.6.3	O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. 
MIC.6.4	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
MIC.6.5	O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; 
MIC.6.6	Wherewith shall I come before the 
MIC.6.7	will the 
MIC.6.8	He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the 
MIC.6.9	The voice of the 
MIC.6.10	Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? 
MIC.6.11	Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights? 
MIC.6.12	For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 
MIC.6.13	Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins. 
MIC.6.14	Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt remove, but shalt not carry away safe; and that which thou carriest away will I give up to the sword. 
MIC.6.15	Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine. 
MIC.6.16	For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels: that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the firstripe fig. 
MIC.7.2	The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. 
MIC.7.3	Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge 
MIC.7.4	The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is 
MIC.7.5	Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
MIC.7.6	For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will look unto the 
MIC.7.8	Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the 
MIC.7.10	Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her; which said unto me, Where is the 
MIC.7.11	A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed. 
MIC.7.12	In that day shall they come unto thee, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and 
MIC.7.13	Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
MIC.7.14	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
MIC.7.15	As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvelous things. 
MIC.7.16	The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. 
MIC.7.17	They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places: they shall come with fear unto the 
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. 
MIC.7.19	He will turn again and have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
MIC.7.20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, 
NAM.1.1	The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
NAM.1.2	The 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.4	He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. 
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. 
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him. 
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.8	But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of the place thereof, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
NAM.1.9	What do ye imagine against the 
NAM.1.10	For though they be like tangled thorns, told be drenched as it were in their drink, they shall be devoured utterly as dry stubble. 
NAM.1.11	There is one gone forth out of thee, that imagineth evil against the 
NAM.1.12	Thus saith the 
NAM.1.13	And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. 
NAM.1.14	And the 
NAM.1.15	Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows: for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
NAM.2.1	He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. 
NAM.2.2	For the 
NAM.2.3	The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the spears are shaken terribly. 
NAM.2.4	The chariots rage in the streets, they justle one against another in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches, they run like the lightnings. 
NAM.2.5	He remembereth his worthies: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared. 
NAM.2.6	The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved. 
NAM.2.7	And Huzzab is uncovered, she is carried away, and her handmaids mourn as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. 
NAM.2.8	But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away; Stand, stand, 
NAM.2.9	Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store, the glory of all pleasant furniture. 
NAM.2.10	She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.
NAM.2.11	Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion 
NAM.2.12	The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin. 
NAM.2.13	Behold, I am against thee, saith the 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not. 
NAM.3.2	The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels; and pransing horses, and jumping chariots; 
NAM.3.3	the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear; and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of carcases: and there is none end of the corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: 
NAM.3.4	because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. 
NAM.3.5	Behold, I am against thee, saith the 
NAM.3.6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. 
NAM.3.7	And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
NAM.3.8	Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, 
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. 
NAM.3.10	Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. 
NAM.3.11	Thou also shalt be drunken, thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a strong hold because of the enemy. 
NAM.3.12	All thy fortresses shall be 
NAM.3.13	Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars. 
NAM.3.14	Draw thee water for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses: go into the clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln. 
NAM.3.15	There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locust. 
NAM.3.16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away. 
NAM.3.17	Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. 
NAM.3.18	Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy worthies are at rest: thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them. 
NAM.3.19	There is no assuaging of thy hurt; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee clap the hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
HAB.1.1	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
HAB.1.2	O 
HAB.1.3	Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there is strife, and contention riseth up. 
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is slacked, and judgement doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore judgement goeth forth perverted.
HAB.1.5	Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I work a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you. 
HAB.1.6	For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation; which march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs. 
HAB.1.7	They are terrible and dreadful: their judgement and their dignity proceed from themselves. 
HAB.1.8	Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen spread themselves: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour. 
HAB.1.9	They come all of them for violence; their faces are set eagerly as the east wind; and they gather captives as the sand. 
HAB.1.10	Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him: he derideth every strong hold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it. 
HAB.1.11	Then shall he sweep by 
HAB.1.12	Art not thou from everlasting, O 
HAB.1.13	Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; 
HAB.1.14	and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? 
HAB.1.15	He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad. 
HAB.1.16	Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his meat plenteous. 
HAB.1.17	Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?
HAB.2.1	I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint. 
HAB.2.2	And the 
HAB.2.3	For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay. 
HAB.2.4	Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
HAB.2.5	Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer, a haughty man, and that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as hell, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples. 
HAB.2.6	Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges! 
HAB.2.7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? 
HAB.2.8	Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein. 
HAB.2.9	Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil! 
HAB.2.10	Thou hast consulted shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul. 
HAB.2.11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. 
HAB.2.12	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity! 
HAB.2.13	Behold, is it not of the 
HAB.2.14	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the 
HAB.2.15	Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that addest thy venom 
HAB.2.16	Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised: the cup of the 
HAB.2.17	For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein. 
HAB.2.18	What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and the teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? 
HAB.2.19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. 
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	In the midst of the years make it known;
HAB.3.2	In wrath remember mercy.
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman,
HAB.3.3	And the Holy One from mount Paran. 
HAB.3.3	His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
HAB.3.4	And 
HAB.3.4	He had rays 
HAB.3.4	And there was the hiding of his power.
HAB.3.5	Before him went the pestilence, and fiery bolts went forth at his feet.
HAB.3.6	He stood, and measured the earth;
HAB.3.6	He beheld, and drove asunder the nations:
HAB.3.6	And the eternal mountains were scattered,
HAB.3.6	The everlasting hills did bow;
HAB.3.6	His goings were 
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:
HAB.3.7	The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
HAB.3.8	Was the 
HAB.3.8	Was thine anger against the rivers,
HAB.3.8	Or thy wrath against the sea,
HAB.3.8	That thou didst ride upon thine horses,
HAB.3.8	Upon thy chariots of salvation?
HAB.3.9	Thy bow was made quite bare;
HAB.3.9	The oaths to the tribes were a 
HAB.3.9	Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw thee, and were afraid;
HAB.3.10	The tempest of waters passed by:
HAB.3.10	The deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still in their habitation;
HAB.3.11	At the light of thine arrows as they went,
HAB.3.11	At the shining of thy glittering spear.
HAB.3.12	Thou didst march through the land in indignation,
HAB.3.12	Tthou didst thresh the nations in anger.
HAB.3.13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
HAB.3.13	For the salvation of thine anointed;
HAB.3.13	Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked,
HAB.3.13	Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. 
HAB.3.14	Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors:
HAB.3.14	They came as a whirlwind to scatter me:
HAB.3.14	Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
HAB.3.15	Thou didst tread the sea with thine horses,
HAB.3.15	The heap of mighty waters.
HAB.3.16	I heard, and my belly trembled,
HAB.3.16	My lips quivered at the voice;
HAB.3.16	Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place:
HAB.3.16	That I should rest in the day of trouble,
HAB.3.16	When it cometh up against the people which invadeth him in troops.
HAB.3.17	For though the fig tree shall not blossom,
HAB.3.17	Neither shall fruit be in the vines;
HAB.3.17	The labour of the olive shall fail,
HAB.3.17	And the fields shall yield no meat;
HAB.3.17	The flock shall be cut off from the fold,
HAB.3.17	And there shall be no herd in the stalls:
HAB.3.18	Yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.18	I will joy in the God of my salvation.
HAB.3.19	Jehovah the Lord, is my strength,
HAB.3.19	And he maketh my feet like hinds' 
HAB.3.19	And will make me to walk upon mine high places.
HAB.3.19	For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.
ZEP.1.1	The word of the 
ZEP.1.2	I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith the 
ZEP.1.3	I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith the 
ZEP.1.4	And I will stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, 
ZEP.1.5	and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, which swear to the 
ZEP.1.6	and them that are turned back from following the 
ZEP.1.7	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord 
ZEP.1.8	And it shall come to pass in the day of the 
ZEP.1.9	And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, which fill their master's house with violence and deceit. 
ZEP.1.10	And in that day, saith the 
ZEP.1.11	Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone: all they that were laden with sliver are cut off. 
ZEP.1.12	And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, The 
ZEP.1.13	And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, 
ZEP.1.16	a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities, and against the high battlements. 
ZEP.1.17	And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the 
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame; 
ZEP.2.2	before the decree bring forth, 
ZEP.2.3	Seek ye the 
ZEP.2.4	For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. 
ZEP.2.5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the 
ZEP.2.6	And the sea coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks. 
ZEP.2.7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. 
ZEP.2.9	Therefore as I live, saith the 
ZEP.2.10	This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.12	Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword. 
ZEP.2.13	And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness. 
ZEP.2.14	And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the chapiters thereof: 
ZEP.2.15	This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted, to the oppressing city! 
ZEP.3.2	She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow. 
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. 
ZEP.3.5	The 
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off nations, their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. 
ZEP.3.7	I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction; so her dwelling should not be cut off, 
ZEP.3.8	Therefore wait ye for me, saith the 
ZEP.3.9	For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. 
ZEP.3.11	In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain. 
ZEP.3.12	But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
ZEP.3.14	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: O Zion, let not thine hands be slack. 
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.18	I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee: 
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth. 
ZEP.3.20	At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring again your captivity before your eyes, saith the 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the 
HAG.1.2	Thus speaketh the 
HAG.1.3	Then came the word of the 
HAG.1.4	Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your cieled houses, while this house lieth waste? 
HAG.1.5	Now therefore thus saith the 
HAG.1.6	Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages 
HAG.1.7	Thus saith the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the 
HAG.1.9	Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the 
HAG.1.10	Therefore for your sake the heaven is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed 
HAG.1.11	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the 
HAG.1.13	Then spake Haggai the 
HAG.1.14	And the 
HAG.1.15	in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth 
HAG.2.1	In the seventh 
HAG.2.2	Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
HAG.2.3	Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing? 
HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the 
HAG.2.5	 the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my spirit abode among you: fear ye not. 
HAG.2.6	For thus saith the 
HAG.2.7	and I will shake all nations, and the desirable things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the 
HAG.2.8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the 
HAG.2.9	The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith the 
HAG.2.10	In the four and twentieth 
HAG.2.11	Thus saith the 
HAG.2.12	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No. 
HAG.2.13	Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. 
HAG.2.14	Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the 
HAG.2.15	And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the 
HAG.2.16	Through all that time, when one came to an heap of twenty 
HAG.2.17	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye 
HAG.2.18	Consider, I pray you, from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth 
HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree hath not brought forth; from this day will I bless 
HAG.2.20	And the word of the 
HAG.2.21	Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth: 
HAG.2.22	and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 
HAG.2.23	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the 
ZEC.1.2	The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.4	Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as the 
ZEC.1.7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the 
ZEC.1.8	I saw in the night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white. 
ZEC.1.9	Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be. 
ZEC.1.10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the 
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.15	And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. 
ZEC.1.16	Therefore thus saith the 
ZEC.1.17	Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.18	And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
ZEC.1.19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
ZEC.1.20	And the 
ZEC.1.21	Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.
ZEC.2.1	And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. 
ZEC.2.3	And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
ZEC.2.4	and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. 
ZEC.2.5	For I, saith the 
ZEC.2.6	Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith the 
ZEC.2.7	Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. 
ZEC.2.8	For thus saith the 
ZEC.2.9	For, behold, I will shake mine hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know that the 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the 
ZEC.2.11	And many nations shall join themselves to the 
ZEC.2.12	And the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, all flesh, before the 
ZEC.3.1	And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the 
ZEC.3.2	And the 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
ZEC.3.4	And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel. 
ZEC.3.5	And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.3.8	Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men which are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. 
ZEC.3.9	For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the 
ZEC.3.10	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.4.1	And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof: 
ZEC.4.3	and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. 
ZEC.4.4	And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? 
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
ZEC.4.6	Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel 
ZEC.4.8	Moreover the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the 
ZEC.4.10	For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, even these seven, 
ZEC.4.11	Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? 
ZEC.4.12	And I answered the second time, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden 
ZEC.4.13	And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
ZEC.4.14	Then said he, These are the two sons of oil, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
ZEC.5.1	Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, a flying roll. 
ZEC.5.2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 
ZEC.5.3	Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be purged out on the one side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be purged out on the other side according to it. 
ZEC.5.4	I will cause it to go forth, saith the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. 
ZEC.5.6	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance in all the land: 
ZEC.5.7	(and behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead:) and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah. 
ZEC.5.8	And he said, This is Wickedness; and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah: and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
ZEC.5.9	Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
ZEC.5.10	Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
ZEC.5.11	And he said unto me, To build her an house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.
ZEC.6.1	And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 
ZEC.6.2	In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
ZEC.6.3	and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled bay horses. 
ZEC.6.4	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 
ZEC.6.5	And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
ZEC.6.6	 wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grisled went forth toward the south country. 
ZEC.6.7	And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
ZEC.6.8	Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
ZEC.6.9	And the word of the 
ZEC.6.10	Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon; 
ZEC.6.11	yea, take 
ZEC.6.12	and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the 
ZEC.6.13	even he shall build the temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the 
ZEC.6.15	And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the 
ZEC.7.2	Now 
ZEC.7.3	 to speak unto the priests of the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	Then came the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh 
ZEC.7.6	And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? 
ZEC.7.7	 not 
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	Thus hath the 
ZEC.7.10	and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. 
ZEC.7.12	Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the 
ZEC.7.13	And it came to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear; so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said the 
ZEC.7.14	but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
ZEC.8.1	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.2	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.3	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.4	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. 
ZEC.8.6	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.8	and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
ZEC.8.9	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.10	For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. 
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith the 
ZEC.8.12	For 
ZEC.8.13	And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, 
ZEC.8.14	For thus saith the 
ZEC.8.15	so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. 
ZEC.8.16	These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbour; execute the judgement of truth and peace in your gates: 
ZEC.8.17	and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the 
ZEC.8.18	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.20	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.21	and the inhabitants of one 
ZEC.8.22	Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	Thus saith the 
ZEC.9.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.9.2	and Hamath also which bordereth thereon: Tyre and Zidon, because she is very wise. 
ZEC.9.3	And Tyre did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed: and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. 
ZEC.9.6	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
ZEC.9.7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God: and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. 
ZEC.9.8	And I will encamp about mine house against the army, that none pass through or return: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
ZEC.9.10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. 
ZEC.9.11	As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.
ZEC.9.12	Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double unto thee. 
ZEC.9.13	For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
ZEC.9.14	And the 
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.16	And the 
ZEC.9.17	For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maids.
ZEC.10.1	Ask ye of the 
ZEC.10.2	For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. 
ZEC.10.3	Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats: for the 
ZEC.10.4	From him shall come forth the corner stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every exactor together.
ZEC.10.5	And they shall be as mighty men, treading down 
ZEC.10.6	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again, for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the 
ZEC.10.7	And 
ZEC.10.8	I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. 
ZEC.10.9	And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries: and they shall live with their children, and shall return. 
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and 
ZEC.10.11	And he shall pass through the sea of affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. 
ZEC.10.12	And I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.11.1	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
ZEC.11.2	Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down. 
ZEC.11.3	A voice of the howling of the shepherds! for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
ZEC.11.4	Thus said the 
ZEC.11.5	whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be the 
ZEC.11.6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
ZEC.11.7	So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
ZEC.11.8	And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me. 
ZEC.11.9	Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them which are left eat every one the flesh of another. 
ZEC.11.10	And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 
ZEC.11.11	And it was broken in that day: and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of the 
ZEC.11.12	And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty 
ZEC.11.13	And the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	And the 
ZEC.11.16	For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek those that be scattered, nor heal that that is broken; neither shall he feed that which is sound, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and shall tear their hoofs in pieces. 
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock, the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
ZEC.12.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.12.2	behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.3	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it. 
ZEC.12.4	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.12.5	And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in the 
ZEC.12.6	In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a torch of fire among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in her own place, even in Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.7	The 
ZEC.12.8	In that day shall the 
ZEC.12.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.10	And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced: and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. 
ZEC.12.11	In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
ZEC.12.12	And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
ZEC.12.13	the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart; 
ZEC.12.14	all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
ZEC.13.1	In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. 
ZEC.13.2	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEC.13.3	And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shall not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive: 
ZEC.13.5	but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth. 
ZEC.13.6	And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
ZEC.13.7	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the 
ZEC.13.8	And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the 
ZEC.13.9	And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, The 
ZEC.14.1	Behold, a day of the 
ZEC.14.2	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished: and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
ZEC.14.3	Then shall the 
ZEC.14.4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, 
ZEC.14.5	And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the 
ZEC.14.6	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be with brightness and with gloom: 
ZEC.14.7	but it shall be one day which is known unto the 
ZEC.14.8	And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. 
ZEC.14.9	And the 
ZEC.14.10	All the land shall be turned as the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel unto the king's winepresses. 
ZEC.14.11	And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely. 
ZEC.14.12	And this shall be the plague wherewith the 
ZEC.14.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the 
ZEC.14.14	And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. 
ZEC.14.15	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as this plague.
ZEC.14.16	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	And it shall be, that whoso of 
ZEC.14.18	And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither 
ZEC.14.19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
ZEC.14.20	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO THE 
ZEC.14.21	Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto the 
MAL.1.1	The burden of the word of the 
MAL.1.2	I have loved you, saith the 
MAL.1.3	but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and 
MAL.1.4	Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith the 
MAL.1.5	And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The 
MAL.1.6	A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the 
MAL.1.7	Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the 
MAL.1.8	And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith the 
MAL.1.9	And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith the 
MAL.1.10	Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle 
MAL.1.11	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the 
MAL.1.12	But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the 
MAL.1.13	Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the 
MAL.1.14	But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing: for I am a great king, saith the 
MAL.2.1	And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. 
MAL.2.2	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the 
MAL.2.3	Behold, I will rebuke the seed for your sake, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your sacrifices; and ye shall be taken away with it. 
MAL.2.4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the 
MAL.2.5	My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear, and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name. 
MAL.2.6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity. 
MAL.2.7	For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the 
MAL.2.8	But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the 
MAL.2.9	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.
MAL.2.10	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
MAL.2.11	Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the 
MAL.2.12	The 
MAL.2.13	And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of the 
MAL.2.14	Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the 
MAL.2.15	And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. 
MAL.2.16	For I hate putting away, saith the 
MAL.2.17	Ye have wearied the 
MAL.3.1	Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he cometh, saith the 
MAL.3.2	But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: 
MAL.3.3	and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto the 
MAL.3.4	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the 
MAL.3.5	And I will come near to you to judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers; and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger 
MAL.3.6	For I the 
MAL.3.7	From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the 
MAL.3.8	Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
MAL.3.9	Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation. 
MAL.3.10	Bring ye the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the 
MAL.3.11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the 
MAL.3.12	And all nations shall call you happy: for ye shall he a delightsome land, saith the 
MAL.3.13	Your words have been stout against me, saith the 
MAL.3.14	Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before the 
MAL.3.15	And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and are delivered. 
MAL.3.16	Then they that feared the 
MAL.3.17	And they shall be mine, saith the 
MAL.3.18	Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
MAL.4.1	For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the 
MAL.4.2	But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall. 
MAL.4.3	And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do make, saith the 
MAL.4.4	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and judgements. 
MAL.4.5	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the 
MAL.4.6	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
MAT.1.1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
MAT.1.2	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; 
MAT.1.3	and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 
MAT.1.4	and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 
MAT.1.5	and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
MAT.1.6	and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her 
MAT.1.7	and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; 
MAT.1.8	and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; 
MAT.1.9	and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; 
MAT.1.10	and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; 
MAT.1.11	and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon. 
MAT.1.12	And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; 
MAT.1.13	and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 
MAT.1.14	and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
MAT.1.15	and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 
MAT.1.16	and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 
MAT.1.19	And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. 
MAT.1.20	But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
MAT.1.21	And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins. 
MAT.1.22	Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
MAT.1.23	Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us. 
MAT.1.24	And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife; 
MAT.1.25	and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
MAT.2.1	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 
MAT.2.2	saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
MAT.2.3	And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 
MAT.2.4	And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born. 
MAT.2.5	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, 
MAT.2.6	And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: For out of thee shall come forth a governor, Which shall be shepherd of my people Israel. 
MAT.2.7	Then Herod privily called the wise men, and learned of them carefully what time the star appeared. 
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out carefully concerning the young child; and when ye have found 
MAT.2.9	And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 
MAT.2.10	And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 
MAT.2.11	And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	And being warned 
MAT.2.13	Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. 
MAT.2.14	And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt; 
MAT.2.15	and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son.
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had carefully learned of the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.2.18	A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she would not be comforted, because they are not.
MAT.2.19	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
MAT.2.20	saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child's life. 
MAT.2.21	And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned 
MAT.2.23	and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.
MAT.3.1	And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, 
MAT.3.2	saying, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
MAT.3.3	For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight. 
MAT.3.4	Now John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan; 
MAT.3.6	and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
MAT.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance: 
MAT.3.9	and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
MAT.3.10	And even now is the axe laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
MAT.3.11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and 
MAT.3.12	whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
MAT.3.13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 
MAT.3.14	But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 
MAT.3.15	But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer 
MAT.3.16	And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him; 
MAT.3.17	and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
MAT.4.1	Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. 
MAT.4.2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered. 
MAT.4.3	And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread. 
MAT.4.4	But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 
MAT.4.6	and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: And on their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
MAT.4.7	Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
MAT.4.9	and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 
MAT.4.10	Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
MAT.4.12	Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee; 
MAT.4.13	and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali: 
MAT.4.14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.4.15	The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, Toward the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, 
MAT.4.16	The people which sat in darkness Saw a great light, And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, To them did light spring up. 
MAT.4.17	From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
MAT.4.18	And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. 
MAT.4.19	And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men. 
MAT.4.20	And they straightway left the nets, and followed him. 
MAT.4.21	And going on from thence he saw other two brethren, James the 
MAT.4.22	And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him.
MAT.4.23	And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people. 
MAT.4.24	And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with devils, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them. 
MAT.4.25	And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and 
MAT.5.1	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him: 
MAT.5.2	and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
MAT.5.3	Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.4	Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 
MAT.5.5	Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 
MAT.5.6	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 
MAT.5.7	Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 
MAT.5.8	Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 
MAT.5.9	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God. 
MAT.5.10	Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.11	Blessed are ye when 
MAT.5.12	Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
MAT.5.13	Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. 
MAT.5.14	Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. 
MAT.5.15	Neither do 
MAT.5.16	Even so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
MAT.5.17	Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill. 
MAT.5.18	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished. 
MAT.5.19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.20	For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed 
MAT.5.21	Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgement: 
MAT.5.22	but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgement; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire. 
MAT.5.23	If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, 
MAT.5.24	leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 
MAT.5.25	Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 
MAT.5.26	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.
MAT.5.27	Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 
MAT.5.28	but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. 
MAT.5.29	And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. 
MAT.5.30	And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell. 
MAT.5.31	It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: 
MAT.5.32	but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.
MAT.5.33	Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: 
MAT.5.34	but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; 
MAT.5.35	nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 
MAT.5.36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black. 
MAT.5.37	But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil 
MAT.5.38	Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 
MAT.5.39	but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 
MAT.5.40	And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. 
MAT.5.41	And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain. 
MAT.5.42	Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
MAT.5.43	Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: 
MAT.5.44	but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; 
MAT.5.45	that ye may be sons of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. 
MAT.5.46	For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 
MAT.5.47	And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more 
MAT.5.48	Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
MAT.6.1	Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.6.2	When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward. 
MAT.6.3	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 
MAT.6.4	that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret shall recompense thee.
MAT.6.5	And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward. 
MAT.6.6	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall recompense thee. 
MAT.6.7	And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 
MAT.6.8	Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
MAT.6.9	After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. 
MAT.6.10	Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. 
MAT.6.11	Give us this day our daily bread. 
MAT.6.12	And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 
MAT.6.13	And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil 
MAT.6.14	For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 
MAT.6.15	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
MAT.6.16	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward. 
MAT.6.17	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; 
MAT.6.18	that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall recompense thee.
MAT.6.19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust doth consume, and where thieves break through and steal: 
MAT.6.20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 
MAT.6.21	for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also. 
MAT.6.22	The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 
MAT.6.23	But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness! 
MAT.6.24	No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
MAT.6.25	Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? 
MAT.6.26	Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they? 
MAT.6.27	And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto his stature? 
MAT.6.28	And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 
MAT.6.29	yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
MAT.6.30	But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, 
MAT.6.31	Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 
MAT.6.32	For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 
MAT.6.33	But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 
MAT.6.34	Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
MAT.7.1	Judge not, that ye be not judged. 
MAT.7.2	For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you. 
MAT.7.3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
MAT.7.4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye? 
MAT.7.5	Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. 
MAT.7.6	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend you.
MAT.7.7	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 
MAT.7.8	for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
MAT.7.9	Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone; 
MAT.7.10	or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent? 
MAT.7.11	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
MAT.7.12	All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them: for this is the law and the prophets. 
MAT.7.13	Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many be they that enter in thereby. 
MAT.7.14	For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it.
MAT.7.15	Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves. 
MAT.7.16	By their fruits ye shall know them. Do 
MAT.7.17	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 
MAT.7.18	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
MAT.7.20	Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
MAT.7.21	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.7.22	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out devils, and by thy name do many mighty works? 
MAT.7.23	And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. 
MAT.7.24	Every one therefore which heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, which built his house upon the rock: 
MAT.7.25	and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock. 
MAT.7.26	And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 
MAT.7.27	and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof. 
MAT.7.28	And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching: 
MAT.7.29	for he taught them as 
MAT.8.1	And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. 
MAT.8.2	And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
MAT.8.3	And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed. 
MAT.8.4	And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
MAT.8.5	And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, 
MAT.8.6	and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 
MAT.8.7	And he saith unto him, I will come and heal him. 
MAT.8.8	And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed. 
MAT.8.9	For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 
MAT.8.10	And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
MAT.8.11	And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: 
MAT.8.12	but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.8.13	And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, 
MAT.8.14	And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever. 
MAT.8.15	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him. 
MAT.8.16	And when even was come, they brought unto him many possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick: 
MAT.8.17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases.
MAT.8.18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. 
MAT.8.19	And there came a scribe, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 
MAT.8.20	And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven 
MAT.8.21	And another of the disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
MAT.8.22	But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
MAT.8.23	And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him. 
MAT.8.24	And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish. 
MAT.8.26	And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
MAT.8.27	And the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
MAT.8.28	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way. 
MAT.8.29	And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? 
MAT.8.30	Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding. 
MAT.8.31	And the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine. 
MAT.8.32	And he said unto them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters. 
MAT.8.33	And they that fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were possessed with devils. 
MAT.8.34	And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought 
MAT.9.1	And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city. 
MAT.9.2	And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven. 
MAT.9.3	And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. 
MAT.9.4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? 
MAT.9.5	For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? 
MAT.9.6	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go unto thy house. 
MAT.9.7	And he arose, and departed to his house. 
MAT.9.8	But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.
MAT.9.9	And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. 
MAT.9.10	And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. 
MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with the publicans and sinners? 
MAT.9.12	But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. 
MAT.9.13	But go ye and learn what 
MAT.9.14	Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast. 
MAT.9.16	And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made. 
MAT.9.17	Neither do 
MAT.9.18	While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. 
MAT.9.19	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and 
MAT.9.20	And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: 
MAT.9.21	for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole. 
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. 
MAT.9.23	And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult, 
MAT.9.24	he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose. 
MAT.9.26	And the fame hereof went forth into all that land.
MAT.9.27	And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David. 
MAT.9.28	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 
MAT.9.29	Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you. 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. 
MAT.9.31	But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land. 
MAT.9.32	And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. 
MAT.9.33	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. 
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
MAT.9.35	And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. 
MAT.9.36	But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. 
MAT.9.38	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his harvest.
MAT.10.1	And he called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. 
MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the 
MAT.10.3	Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent forth, and charged them, saying, Go not into 
MAT.10.6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.10.7	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
MAT.10.8	Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely ye received, freely give. 
MAT.10.9	Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses; 
MAT.10.10	no wallet for 
MAT.10.11	And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth. 
MAT.10.12	And as ye enter into the house, salute it. 
MAT.10.13	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
MAT.10.14	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet. 
MAT.10.15	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for that city.
MAT.10.16	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. 
MAT.10.17	But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you; 
MAT.10.18	yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 
MAT.10.19	But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. 
MAT.10.20	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you. 
MAT.10.21	And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
MAT.10.22	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. 
MAT.10.23	But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. 
MAT.10.24	A disciple is not above his master, nor a servant above his lord. 
MAT.10.25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more 
MAT.10.26	Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. 
MAT.10.27	What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light: and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops. 
MAT.10.28	And be not afraid of them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
MAT.10.29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father: 
MAT.10.30	but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
MAT.10.31	Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows. 
MAT.10.32	Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.10.33	But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.10.34	Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 
MAT.10.35	For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law: 
MAT.10.36	and a man's foes 
MAT.10.37	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.38	And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.39	He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. 
MAT.10.40	He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
MAT.10.41	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 
MAT.10.42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
MAT.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities. 
MAT.11.2	Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples, 
MAT.11.3	and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? 
MAT.11.4	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go your way and tell John the things which ye do hear and see: 
MAT.11.5	the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them. 
MAT.11.6	And blessed is he, whosoever shall find none occasion of stumbling in me.
MAT.11.7	And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? 
MAT.11.8	But what went ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft 
MAT.11.9	But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. 
MAT.11.10	This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee. 
MAT.11.11	Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
MAT.11.12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force. 
MAT.11.13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
MAT.11.14	And if ye are willing to receive 
MAT.11.15	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.11.16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, which call unto their fellows, 
MAT.11.17	and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn. 
MAT.11.18	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 
MAT.11.19	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works. 
MAT.11.20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not. 
MAT.11.21	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
MAT.11.22	Howbeit I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgement, than for you. 
MAT.11.23	And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day. 
MAT.11.24	Howbeit I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgement, than for thee.
MAT.11.25	At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: 
MAT.11.26	yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. 
MAT.11.27	All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal 
MAT.11.28	Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
MAT.11.29	Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 
MAT.11.30	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
MAT.12.1	At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the cornfields; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck ears of corn, and to eat. 
MAT.12.2	But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath. 
MAT.12.3	But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; 
MAT.12.4	how be entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests? 
MAT.12.5	Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless? 
MAT.12.6	But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here. 
MAT.12.7	But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. 
MAT.12.8	For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath. 
MAT.12.9	And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue: 
MAT.12.10	and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him. 
MAT.12.11	And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 
MAT.12.12	How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day. 
MAT.12.13	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him. 
MAT.12.15	And Jesus perceiving 
MAT.12.16	and charged them that they should not make him known: 
MAT.12.17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.12.18	Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgement to the Gentiles. 
MAT.12.19	He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets. 
MAT.12.20	A bruised reed shall he not break, And smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgement unto victory. 
MAT.12.21	And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
MAT.12.22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw. 
MAT.12.23	And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Is this the son of David? 
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. 
MAT.12.25	And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: 
MAT.12.26	and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? 
MAT.12.27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. 
MAT.12.28	But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. 
MAT.12.29	Or how can one enter into the house of the strong 
MAT.12.30	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. 
MAT.12.31	Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. 
MAT.12.32	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come. 
MAT.12.33	Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit. 
MAT.12.34	Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 
MAT.12.35	The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. 
MAT.12.36	And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement. 
MAT.12.37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
MAT.12.38	Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. 
MAT.12.39	But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet: 
MAT.12.40	for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 
MAT.12.41	The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. 
MAT.12.42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 
MAT.12.43	But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not. 
MAT.12.44	Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. 
MAT.12.45	Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.
MAT.12.46	While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him. 
MAT.12.47	And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee. 
MAT.12.48	But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 
MAT.12.49	And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren! 
MAT.12.50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
MAT.13.1	On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. 
MAT.13.2	And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. 
MAT.13.3	And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow; 
MAT.13.4	and as he sowed, some 
MAT.13.5	and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth: 
MAT.13.6	and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 
MAT.13.7	And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked them: 
MAT.13.8	and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
MAT.13.9	He that hath ears, let him hear. 
MAT.13.10	And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 
MAT.13.11	And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 
MAT.13.12	For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath. 
MAT.13.13	Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 
MAT.13.14	And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: 
MAT.13.15	For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them. 
MAT.13.16	But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. 
MAT.13.17	For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. 
MAT.13.18	Hear then ye the parable of the sower. 
MAT.13.19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, 
MAT.13.20	And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; 
MAT.13.21	yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth. 
MAT.13.22	And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 
MAT.13.23	And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
MAT.13.24	Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field: 
MAT.13.25	but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away. 
MAT.13.26	But when the blade sprang up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 
MAT.13.27	And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? 
MAT.13.28	And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 
MAT.13.29	But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them. 
MAT.13.30	Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 
MAT.13.31	Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 
MAT.13.32	which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof. 
MAT.13.33	Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened. 
MAT.13.34	All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them: 
MAT.13.35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. 
MAT.13.36	Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 
MAT.13.37	And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 
MAT.13.38	and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil 
MAT.13.39	and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels. 
MAT.13.40	As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world. 
MAT.13.41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, 
MAT.13.42	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.13.43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.
MAT.13.44	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 
MAT.13.45	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: 
MAT.13.46	and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. 
MAT.13.47	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 
MAT.13.48	which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away. 
MAT.13.49	So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous, 
MAT.13.50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.13.51	Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea. 
MAT.13.52	And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
MAT.13.53	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. 
MAT.13.54	And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? 
MAT.13.57	And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. 
MAT.13.58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, 
MAT.14.2	and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him. 
MAT.14.3	For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. 
MAT.14.4	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 
MAT.14.5	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
MAT.14.6	But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod. 
MAT.14.7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask. 
MAT.14.8	And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here in a charger the head of John the Baptist. 
MAT.14.9	And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them which sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given; 
MAT.14.10	and he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	Now when Jesus heard 
MAT.14.14	And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. 
MAT.14.15	And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food. 
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat. 
MAT.14.17	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. 
MAT.14.18	And he said, Bring them hither to me. 
MAT.14.19	And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 
MAT.14.20	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
MAT.14.21	And they that did eat were about five thousand men, beside women an children.
MAT.14.22	And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away. 
MAT.14.23	And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. 
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea. 
MAT.14.26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is an apparition; and they cried out for fear. 
MAT.14.27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. 
MAT.14.28	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters. 
MAT.14.29	And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters, to come to Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me. 
MAT.14.31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? 
MAT.14.32	And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
MAT.14.34	And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick; 
MAT.14.36	and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.
MAT.15.1	Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, 
MAT.15.2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
MAT.15.3	And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 
MAT.15.4	For God said, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death. 
MAT.15.5	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given 
MAT.15.6	he shall not honour his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition. 
MAT.15.7	Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 
MAT.15.8	This people honoureth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me. 
MAT.15.9	But in vain do they worship me, Teaching 
MAT.15.10	And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 
MAT.15.11	Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man. 
MAT.15.12	Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? 
MAT.15.13	But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. 
MAT.15.14	Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit. 
MAT.15.15	And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable. 
MAT.15.16	And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding? 
MAT.15.17	Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 
MAT.15.18	But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man. 
MAT.15.19	For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings: 
MAT.15.20	these are the things which defile the man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.
MAT.15.21	And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
MAT.15.23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
MAT.15.24	But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.15.25	But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
MAT.15.26	And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. 
MAT.15.27	But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
MAT.15.29	And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. 
MAT.15.30	And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them: 
MAT.15.31	insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
MAT.15.32	And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint in the way. 
MAT.15.33	And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place, as to fill so great a multitude? 
MAT.15.34	And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. 
MAT.15.35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; 
MAT.15.36	and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 
MAT.15.37	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
MAT.15.38	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 
MAT.15.39	And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting him asked him to shew them a sign from heaven. 
MAT.16.2	But he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, 
MAT.16.3	And in the morning, 
MAT.16.4	An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
MAT.16.5	And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread. 
MAT.16.6	And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
MAT.16.7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread. 
MAT.16.8	And Jesus perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have no bread? 
MAT.16.9	Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 
MAT.16.10	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 
MAT.16.11	How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
MAT.16.12	Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is? 
MAT.16.14	And they said, Some 
MAT.16.15	He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am? 
MAT.16.16	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 
MAT.16.17	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.16.18	And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 
MAT.16.19	I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
MAT.16.20	Then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. 
MAT.16.22	And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee. 
MAT.16.23	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
MAT.16.24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
MAT.16.25	For whosoever would save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. 
MAT.16.26	For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life? 
MAT.16.27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds. 
MAT.16.28	Verily I say unto you, There be some of them that stand here, which shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
MAT.17.1	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: 
MAT.17.2	and he was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him. 
MAT.17.4	And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
MAT.17.5	While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 
MAT.17.6	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 
MAT.17.7	And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 
MAT.17.8	And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only. 
MAT.17.9	And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead. 
MAT.17.10	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come? 
MAT.17.11	And he answered and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things: 
MAT.17.12	but I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they listed. Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them. 
MAT.17.13	Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying, 
MAT.17.15	Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously: for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and oft-times into the water. 
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. 
MAT.17.17	And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me. 
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked him; and the devil went out from him: and the boy was cured from that hour. 
MAT.17.19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out? 
MAT.17.20	And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
MAT.17.22	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men; 
MAT.17.23	and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry.
MAT.17.24	And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay the half-shekel? 
MAT.17.25	He saith, Yea. And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers? 
MAT.17.26	And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free. 
MAT.17.27	But, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
MAT.18.1	In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 
MAT.18.2	And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, 
MAT.18.3	and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me: 
MAT.18.6	But whoso shall cause one of these little ones which believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and 
MAT.18.7	Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh! 
MAT.18.8	And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. 
MAT.18.9	And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire. 
MAT.18.10	See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
MAT.18.12	How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray? 
MAT.18.13	And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray. 
MAT.18.14	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
MAT.18.15	And if thy brother sin against thee, go, shew him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. 
MAT.18.16	But if he hear 
MAT.18.17	And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican. 
MAT.18.18	Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
MAT.18.19	Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
MAT.18.21	Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? 
MAT.18.22	Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven. 
MAT.18.23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would make a reckoning with his servants. 
MAT.18.24	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. 
MAT.18.25	But forasmuch as he had not 
MAT.18.26	The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 
MAT.18.27	And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. 
MAT.18.28	But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him a hundred pence: and he laid hold on him, and took 
MAT.18.29	So his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. 
MAT.18.30	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which was due. 
MAT.18.31	So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. 
MAT.18.32	Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me: 
MAT.18.33	shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee? 
MAT.18.34	And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. 
MAT.18.35	So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
MAT.19.1	And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond Jordan; 
MAT.19.2	and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	And there came unto him Pharisees, tempting him, and saying, Is it lawful 
MAT.19.4	And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he which made 
MAT.19.5	and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh? 
MAT.19.6	So that they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
MAT.19.7	They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put 
MAT.19.8	He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so. 
MAT.19.9	And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery. 
MAT.19.10	The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. 
MAT.19.11	But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. 
MAT.19.12	For there are eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, which were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
MAT.19.13	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.19.15	And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
MAT.19.16	And behold, one came to him and said, Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 
MAT.19.17	And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments. 
MAT.19.18	He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 
MAT.19.19	Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
MAT.19.20	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet? 
MAT.19.21	Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions.
MAT.19.23	And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.19.24	And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
MAT.19.25	And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved? 
MAT.19.26	And Jesus looking upon 
MAT.19.27	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have? 
MAT.19.28	And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
MAT.19.29	And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life. 
MAT.19.30	But many shall be last 
MAT.20.1	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. 
MAT.20.2	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
MAT.20.3	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle; 
MAT.20.4	and to them he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. 
MAT.20.5	Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. 
MAT.20.6	And about the eleventh 
MAT.20.7	They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard. 
MAT.20.8	And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. 
MAT.20.9	And when they came that 
MAT.20.10	And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a penny. 
MAT.20.11	And when they received it, they murmured against the householder, 
MAT.20.12	saying, These last have spent 
MAT.20.13	But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 
MAT.20.14	Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee. 
MAT.20.15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good? 
MAT.20.16	So the last shall be first, and the first last.
MAT.20.17	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and in the way he said unto them, 
MAT.20.18	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, 
MAT.20.19	and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.
MAT.20.20	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping 
MAT.20.21	And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom. 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able. 
MAT.20.23	He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on 
MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren. 
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 
MAT.20.26	Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; 
MAT.20.27	and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant: 
MAT.20.28	even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
MAT.20.29	And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. 
MAT.20.30	And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David. 
MAT.20.31	And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David. 
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you? 
MAT.20.33	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 
MAT.20.34	And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes: and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.
MAT.21.1	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 
MAT.21.2	saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose 
MAT.21.3	And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. 
MAT.21.4	Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, 
MAT.21.5	Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, Meek, and riding upon an ass, And upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
MAT.21.6	And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them, 
MAT.21.7	and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon. 
MAT.21.8	And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way. 
MAT.21.9	And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed 
MAT.21.10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this? 
MAT.21.11	And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
MAT.21.12	And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves; 
MAT.21.13	and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers. 
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple: and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation, 
MAT.21.16	and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? 
MAT.21.17	And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
MAT.21.18	Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered. 
MAT.21.19	And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away. 
MAT.21.20	And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away? 
MAT.21.21	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done. 
MAT.21.22	And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
MAT.21.23	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? 
MAT.21.24	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MAT.21.25	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him? 
MAT.21.26	But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet. 
MAT.21.27	And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
MAT.21.28	But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in the vineyard. 
MAT.21.29	And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went. 
MAT.21.30	And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I 
MAT.21.31	Whether of the twain did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 
MAT.21.32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.
MAT.21.33	Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, which planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. 
MAT.21.34	And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits. 
MAT.21.35	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 
MAT.21.36	Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner. 
MAT.21.37	But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. 
MAT.21.38	But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance. 
MAT.21.39	And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. 
MAT.21.40	When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 
MAT.21.41	They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. 
MAT.21.42	Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner: This was from the Lord, And it is marvelous in our eyes? 
MAT.21.43	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. 
MAT.21.44	And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust. 
MAT.21.45	And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. 
MAT.21.46	And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.
MAT.22.1	And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying, 
MAT.22.2	The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage feast for his son, 
MAT.22.3	and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come. 
MAT.22.4	Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast. 
MAT.22.5	But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise: 
MAT.22.6	and the rest laid hold on his servants, and entreated them shamefully, and killed them. 
MAT.22.7	But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. 
MAT.22.8	Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy. 
MAT.22.9	Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast. 
MAT.22.10	And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests. 
MAT.22.11	But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding-garment: 
MAT.22.12	and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless. 
MAT.22.13	Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.22.14	For many are called, but few chosen.
MAT.22.15	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in 
MAT.22.16	And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men. 
MAT.22.17	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
MAT.22.18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
MAT.22.19	Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
MAT.22.20	And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
MAT.22.21	They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. 
MAT.22.22	And when they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went their way.
MAT.22.23	On that day there came to him Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him, 
MAT.22.24	saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
MAT.22.25	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother; 
MAT.22.26	in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	And after them all the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. 
MAT.22.29	But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. 
MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven. 
MAT.22.31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 
MAT.22.32	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not 
MAT.22.33	And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
MAT.22.34	But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together. 
MAT.22.35	And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, 
MAT.22.36	Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 
MAT.22.37	And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 
MAT.22.38	This is the great and first commandment. 
MAT.22.39	And a second like 
MAT.22.40	On these two commandments hangeth the whole law, and the prophets.
MAT.22.41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, 
MAT.22.42	saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, 
MAT.22.43	He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, 
MAT.22.44	The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet? 
MAT.22.45	If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son? 
MAT.22.46	And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples, 
MAT.23.2	saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: 
MAT.23.3	all things therefore whatsoever they bid you, 
MAT.23.4	Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. 
MAT.23.5	But all their works they do for to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders 
MAT.23.6	and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, 
MAT.23.7	and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi. 
MAT.23.8	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren. 
MAT.23.9	And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 
MAT.23.10	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, 
MAT.23.11	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. 
MAT.23.12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.
MAT.23.13	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter.
MAT.23.15	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves. 
MAT.23.16	Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor. 
MAT.23.17	Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold? 
MAT.23.18	And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor. 
MAT.23.19	Ye blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? 
MAT.23.20	He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. 
MAT.23.21	And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. 
MAT.23.22	And he that sweareth by the heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. 
MAT.23.23	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, judgement, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone. 
MAT.23.24	Ye blind guides, which strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel. 
MAT.23.25	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess. 
MAT.23.26	Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also. 
MAT.23.27	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 
MAT.23.28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 
MAT.23.29	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous, 
MAT.23.30	and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 
MAT.23.31	Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets. 
MAT.23.32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 
MAT.23.33	Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgement of hell?
MAT.23.34	Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city: 
MAT.23.35	that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar. 
MAT.23.36	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. 
MAT.23.37	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! 
MAT.23.38	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. 
MAT.23.39	For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed 
MAT.24.1	And Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to shew him the buildings of the temple. 
MAT.24.2	But he answered and said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
MAT.24.3	And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what 
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray. 
MAT.24.5	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray. 
MAT.24.6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for 
MAT.24.7	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places. 
MAT.24.8	But all these things are the beginning of travail. 
MAT.24.9	Then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name's sake. 
MAT.24.10	And then shall many stumble, and shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another. 
MAT.24.11	And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray. 
MAT.24.12	And because iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold. 
MAT.24.13	But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. 
MAT.24.14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and then shall the end come. 
MAT.24.15	When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand), 
MAT.24.16	then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains: 
MAT.24.17	let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house: 
MAT.24.18	and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloke. 
MAT.24.19	But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! 
MAT.24.20	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath: 
MAT.24.21	for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be. 
MAT.24.22	And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. 
MAT.24.23	Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here; believe 
MAT.24.24	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 
MAT.24.25	Behold, I have told you beforehand. 
MAT.24.26	If therefore they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner chambers; believe 
MAT.24.27	For as the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man. 
MAT.24.28	Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. 
MAT.24.29	But immediately, after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 
MAT.24.30	and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 
MAT.24.31	And he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
MAT.24.32	Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh; 
MAT.24.33	even so ye also, when ye see all these things, know ye that he is nigh, 
MAT.24.34	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished. 
MAT.24.35	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. 
MAT.24.36	But of that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only. 
MAT.24.37	And as 
MAT.24.38	For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, 
MAT.24.39	and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man. 
MAT.24.40	Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left: 
MAT.24.41	two women 
MAT.24.42	Watch therefore: for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh. 
MAT.24.43	But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. 
MAT.24.44	Therefore be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh. 
MAT.24.45	Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season? 
MAT.24.46	Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 
MAT.24.47	Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath. 
MAT.24.48	But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth; 
MAT.24.49	and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken; 
MAT.24.50	the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, 
MAT.24.51	and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.25.1	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 
MAT.25.2	And five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 
MAT.25.3	For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them: 
MAT.25.4	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
MAT.25.6	But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him. 
MAT.25.7	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 
MAT.25.8	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. 
MAT.25.9	But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 
MAT.25.10	And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. 
MAT.25.11	Afterward come also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 
MAT.25.12	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 
MAT.25.13	Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.
MAT.25.14	For 
MAT.25.15	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey. 
MAT.25.16	Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents. 
MAT.25.17	In like manner he also that 
MAT.25.18	But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. 
MAT.25.19	Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. 
MAT.25.20	And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents. 
MAT.25.21	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
MAT.25.22	And he also that 
MAT.25.23	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
MAT.25.24	And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter: 
MAT.25.25	and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own. 
MAT.25.26	But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; 
MAT.25.27	thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest. 
MAT.25.28	Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. 
MAT.25.29	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away. 
MAT.25.30	And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.25.31	But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory: 
MAT.25.32	and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats: 
MAT.25.33	and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 
MAT.25.34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
MAT.25.35	for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in; 
MAT.25.36	naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 
MAT.25.37	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink? 
MAT.25.38	And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 
MAT.25.39	And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 
MAT.25.40	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, 
MAT.25.41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels: 
MAT.25.42	for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 
MAT.25.43	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 
MAT.25.44	Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 
MAT.25.45	Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me. 
MAT.25.46	And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.
MAT.26.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples, 
MAT.26.2	Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified. 
MAT.26.3	Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; 
MAT.26.4	and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. 
MAT.26.5	But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.
MAT.26.6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
MAT.26.7	there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat. 
MAT.26.8	But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 
MAT.26.9	For this 
MAT.26.10	But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 
MAT.26.11	For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 
MAT.26.12	For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 
MAT.26.13	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 
MAT.26.15	and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver. 
MAT.26.16	And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him 
MAT.26.17	Now on the first 
MAT.26.18	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 
MAT.26.19	And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
MAT.26.20	Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples; 
MAT.26.21	and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
MAT.26.22	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord? 
MAT.26.23	And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 
MAT.26.24	The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. 
MAT.26.25	And Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.
MAT.26.26	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 
MAT.26.27	And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 
MAT.26.28	for this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many unto remission of sins. 
MAT.26.29	But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. 
MAT.26.30	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 
MAT.26.32	But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. 
MAT.26.33	But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended. 
MAT.26.34	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
MAT.26.35	Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, 
MAT.26.36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray. 
MAT.26.37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. 
MAT.26.38	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me. 
MAT.26.39	And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. 
MAT.26.40	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 
MAT.26.41	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
MAT.26.42	Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done. 
MAT.26.43	And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. 
MAT.26.45	Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MAT.26.46	Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.
MAT.26.47	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him. 
MAT.26.49	And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. 
MAT.26.50	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, 
MAT.26.51	And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. 
MAT.26.52	Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
MAT.26.53	Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? 
MAT.26.54	How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 
MAT.26.55	In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not. 
MAT.26.56	But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
MAT.26.57	And they that had taken Jesus led him away to 
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end. 
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; 
MAT.26.60	and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two, 
MAT.26.61	and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 
MAT.26.62	And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
MAT.26.64	Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: 
MAT.26.66	what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death. 
MAT.26.67	Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands, 
MAT.26.68	saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean. 
MAT.26.70	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 
MAT.26.71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another 
MAT.26.72	And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man. 
MAT.26.73	And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art 
MAT.26.74	Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew. 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
MAT.27.1	Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
MAT.27.2	and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor. 
MAT.27.3	Then Judas, which betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
MAT.27.4	saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou 
MAT.27.5	And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. 
MAT.27.6	And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood. 
MAT.27.7	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 
MAT.27.8	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. 
MAT.27.9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom 
MAT.27.10	and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 
MAT.27.12	And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
MAT.27.13	Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 
MAT.27.14	And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marveled greatly. 
MAT.27.15	Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would. 
MAT.27.16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
MAT.27.17	When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? 
MAT.27.18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up. 
MAT.27.19	And while he was sitting on the judgement-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
MAT.27.20	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
MAT.27.21	But the governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas. 
MAT.27.22	Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus which is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. 
MAT.27.23	And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified. 
MAT.27.24	So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man: see ye 
MAT.27.25	And all the people answered and said, His blood 
MAT.27.26	Then released he unto them Barabbas: but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified. 
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace, and gathered unto him the whole band. 
MAT.27.28	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
MAT.27.29	And they plaited a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
MAT.27.30	And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head. 
MAT.27.31	And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him. 
MAT.27.32	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go 
MAT.27.33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull, 
MAT.27.34	they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink. 
MAT.27.35	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots: 
MAT.27.36	and they sat and watched him there. 
MAT.27.37	And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
MAT.27.38	Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left. 
MAT.27.39	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, 
MAT.27.40	and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross. 
MAT.27.41	In like manner also the chief priests mocking 
MAT.27.42	He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him. 
MAT.27.43	He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
MAT.27.44	And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach. 
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 
MAT.27.46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
MAT.27.47	And some of them that stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah. 
MAT.27.48	And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 
MAT.27.49	And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.
MAT.27.50	And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. 
MAT.27.51	And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent; 
MAT.27.52	and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; 
MAT.27.53	and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. 
MAT.27.54	Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 
MAT.27.55	And many women were there beholding from afar, which had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 
MAT.27.56	among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
MAT.27.57	And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 
MAT.27.58	this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up. 
MAT.27.59	And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
MAT.27.60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. 
MAT.27.61	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. 
MAT.27.62	Now on the morrow, which is 
MAT.27.63	saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again. 
MAT.27.64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first. 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go your way, make it 
MAT.27.66	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.
MAT.28.1	Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first 
MAT.28.2	And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. 
MAT.28.3	His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
MAT.28.4	and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men. 
MAT.28.5	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which hath been crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 
MAT.28.7	And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 
MAT.28.8	And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 
MAT.28.9	And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. 
MAT.28.10	Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
MAT.28.11	Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. 
MAT.28.12	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
MAT.28.13	saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 
MAT.28.14	And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. 
MAT.28.15	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, 
MAT.28.16	But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
MAT.28.17	And when they saw him, they worshipped 
MAT.28.18	And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. 
MAT.28.19	Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost: 
MAT.28.20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
MRK.1.2	Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way; 
MRK.1.3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight; 
MRK.1.4	John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins. 
MRK.1.5	And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 
MRK.1.6	And John was clothed with camel's hair, and 
MRK.1.7	And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 
MRK.1.8	I baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
MRK.1.9	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan. 
MRK.1.10	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him: 
MRK.1.11	And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. 
MRK.1.12	And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness. 
MRK.1.13	And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
MRK.1.14	Now after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, 
MRK.1.15	and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel. 
MRK.1.16	And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea: for they were fishers. 
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 
MRK.1.18	And straightway they left the nets, and followed him. 
MRK.1.19	And going on a little further, he saw James the 
MRK.1.20	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. 
MRK.1.21	And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 
MRK.1.22	And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
MRK.1.23	And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
MRK.1.24	saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
MRK.1.25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 
MRK.1.26	And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. 
MRK.1.28	And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
MRK.1.29	And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
MRK.1.30	Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her: 
MRK.1.31	and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 
MRK.1.32	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with devils. 
MRK.1.33	And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
MRK.1.34	And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and he suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 
MRK.1.35	And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed. 
MRK.1.36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him; 
MRK.1.37	and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee. 
MRK.1.38	And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth. 
MRK.1.39	And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out devils.
MRK.1.40	And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
MRK.1.41	And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean. 
MRK.1.42	And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. 
MRK.1.43	And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out, 
MRK.1.44	and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
MRK.1.45	But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
MRK.2.1	And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house. 
MRK.2.2	And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room 
MRK.2.3	And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four. 
MRK.2.4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. 
MRK.2.5	And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven. 
MRK.2.6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
MRK.2.7	Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, 
MRK.2.8	And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 
MRK.2.9	Whether is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? 
MRK.2.10	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), 
MRK.2.11	I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house. 
MRK.2.12	And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
MRK.2.13	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 
MRK.2.14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the 
MRK.2.15	And it came to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. 
MRK.2.16	And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his disciples, He eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners. 
MRK.2.17	And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
MRK.2.18	And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 
MRK.2.20	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day. 
MRK.2.21	No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made. 
MRK.2.22	And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins: else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins: but 
MRK.2.23	And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the cornfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? 
MRK.2.25	And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? 
MRK.2.26	How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him? 
MRK.2.27	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 
MRK.2.28	so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
MRK.3.1	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had his hand withered. 
MRK.3.2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 
MRK.3.3	And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth. 
MRK.3.4	And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace. 
MRK.3.5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored. 
MRK.3.6	And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him. 
MRK.3.7	And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed: and from Judaea, 
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him. 
MRK.3.9	And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him: 
MRK.3.10	for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him. 
MRK.3.11	And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
MRK.3.12	And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
MRK.3.13	And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would: and they went unto him. 
MRK.3.14	And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
MRK.3.15	and to have authority to cast out devils: 
MRK.3.16	and Simon he surnamed Peter; 
MRK.3.17	and James the 
MRK.3.18	and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him. And he cometh into a house. 
MRK.3.20	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
MRK.3.21	And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
MRK.3.22	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the devils casteth he out the devils. 
MRK.3.23	And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? 
MRK.3.24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
MRK.3.25	And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 
MRK.3.26	And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. 
MRK.3.27	But no one can enter into the house of the strong 
MRK.3.28	Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 
MRK.3.29	but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin: 
MRK.3.30	because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
MRK.3.31	And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him. 
MRK.3.32	And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 
MRK.3.33	And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren? 
MRK.3.34	And looking round on them which sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren! 
MRK.3.35	For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
MRK.4.1	And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land. 
MRK.4.2	And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching, 
MRK.4.3	Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow: 
MRK.4.4	and it came to pass, as he sowed, some 
MRK.4.5	And other fell on the rocky 
MRK.4.6	and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
MRK.4.7	And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
MRK.4.8	And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. 
MRK.4.9	And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
MRK.4.10	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables. 
MRK.4.11	And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables: 
MRK.4.12	that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them. 
MRK.4.13	And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables? 
MRK.4.14	The sower soweth the word. 
MRK.4.15	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them. 
MRK.4.16	And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky 
MRK.4.17	and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble. 
MRK.4.18	And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word, 
MRK.4.19	and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
MRK.4.20	And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
MRK.4.21	And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, 
MRK.4.22	For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was 
MRK.4.23	If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
MRK.4.24	And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you: and more shall be given unto you. 
MRK.4.25	For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath. 
MRK.4.26	And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth; 
MRK.4.27	and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how. 
MRK.4.28	The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. 
MRK.4.29	But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come. 
MRK.4.30	And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth? 
MRK.4.31	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth, 
MRK.4.32	yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof. 
MRK.4.33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it: 
MRK.4.34	and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.
MRK.4.35	And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side. 
MRK.4.36	And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. 
MRK.4.37	And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling. 
MRK.4.38	And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 
MRK.4.39	And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
MRK.4.40	And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith? 
MRK.4.41	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
MRK.5.1	And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. 
MRK.5.2	And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
MRK.5.3	who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain; 
MRK.5.4	because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him. 
MRK.5.5	And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him; 
MRK.5.7	and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not. 
MRK.5.8	For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man. 
MRK.5.9	And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many. 
MRK.5.10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
MRK.5.11	Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding. 
MRK.5.12	And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
MRK.5.13	And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, 
MRK.5.14	And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass. 
MRK.5.15	And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with devils sitting, clothed and in his right mind, 
MRK.5.16	And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with devils, and concerning the swine. 
MRK.5.17	And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders. 
MRK.5.18	And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with devils besought him that he might be with him. 
MRK.5.19	And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and 
MRK.5.20	And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
MRK.5.21	And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him: and he was by the sea. 
MRK.5.22	And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet, 
MRK.5.23	and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: 
MRK.5.24	And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him. 
MRK.5.25	And a woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 
MRK.5.26	and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, 
MRK.5.27	having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. 
MRK.5.28	For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole. 
MRK.5.29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague. 
MRK.5.30	And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power 
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
MRK.5.32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 
MRK.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
MRK.5.34	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
MRK.5.35	While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's 
MRK.5.36	But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe. 
MRK.5.37	And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and 
MRK.5.39	And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth. 
MRK.5.40	And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was. 
MRK.5.41	And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise. 
MRK.5.42	And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement. 
MRK.5.43	And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that 
MRK.6.1	And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 
MRK.6.2	And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and 
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him. 
MRK.6.4	And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 
MRK.6.5	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. 
MRK.6.6	And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.
MRK.6.7	And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits; 
MRK.6.8	and he charged them that they should take nothing for 
MRK.6.9	but 
MRK.6.10	And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence. 
MRK.6.11	And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them. 
MRK.6.12	And they went out, and preached that 
MRK.6.13	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
MRK.6.14	And king Herod heard 
MRK.6.15	But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, 
MRK.6.16	But Herod, when he heard 
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. 
MRK.6.18	For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. 
MRK.6.19	And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; 
MRK.6.20	for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous man and a holy, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly. 
MRK.6.21	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee; 
MRK.6.22	and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. 
MRK.6.23	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. 
MRK.6.24	And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
MRK.6.25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me in a charger the head of John the Baptist. 
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her. 
MRK.6.27	And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	And when his disciples heard 
MRK.6.30	And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught. 
MRK.6.31	And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
MRK.6.32	And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart. 
MRK.6.33	And 
MRK.6.34	And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. 
MRK.6.35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent: 
MRK.6.36	send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat. 
MRK.6.37	But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? 
MRK.6.38	And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go 
MRK.6.39	And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
MRK.6.41	And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. 
MRK.6.42	And they did all eat, and were filled. 
MRK.6.43	And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes. 
MRK.6.44	And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before 
MRK.6.46	And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray. 
MRK.6.47	And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them: 
MRK.6.49	but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was an apparition, and cried out: 
MRK.6.50	for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. 
MRK.6.51	And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves; 
MRK.6.52	for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened. 
MRK.6.53	And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. 
MRK.6.54	And when they were come out of the boat, straightway 
MRK.6.55	and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
MRK.7.1	And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which had come from Jerusalem, 
MRK.7.2	and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands. 
MRK.7.3	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders: 
MRK.7.4	and 
MRK.7.5	And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands? 
MRK.7.6	And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me. 
MRK.7.7	But in vain do they worship me, Teaching 
MRK.7.8	Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men. 
MRK.7.9	And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. 
MRK.7.10	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death: 
MRK.7.11	but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given 
MRK.7.12	ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; 
MRK.7.13	making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do. 
MRK.7.14	And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand: 
MRK.7.15	there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him: but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
MRK.7.17	And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable. 
MRK.7.18	And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, 
MRK.7.19	because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? 
MRK.7.20	And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man. 
MRK.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, 
MRK.7.22	covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness: 
MRK.7.23	all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.
MRK.7.24	And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it: and he could not be hid. 
MRK.7.25	But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. 
MRK.7.26	Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
MRK.7.27	And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. 
MRK.7.28	But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord: even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
MRK.7.29	And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 
MRK.7.30	And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the devil gone out.
MRK.7.31	And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. 
MRK.7.32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him. 
MRK.7.33	And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; 
MRK.7.34	and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 
MRK.7.35	And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. 
MRK.7.36	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it. 
MRK.7.37	And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
MRK.8.1	In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, 
MRK.8.2	I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: 
MRK.8.3	and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; and some of them are come from far. 
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? 
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. 
MRK.8.6	And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude. 
MRK.8.7	And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. 
MRK.8.8	And they did eat, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets. 
MRK.8.9	And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
MRK.8.10	And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. 
MRK.8.11	And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
MRK.8.12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. 
MRK.8.13	And he left them, and again entering into 
MRK.8.14	And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf. 
MRK.8.15	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. 
MRK.8.16	And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread. 
MRK.8.17	And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened? 
MRK.8.18	Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? 
MRK.8.19	When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. 
MRK.8.20	And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven. 
MRK.8.21	And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?
MRK.8.22	And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. 
MRK.8.23	And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught? 
MRK.8.24	And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold 
MRK.8.25	Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly. 
MRK.8.26	And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.
MRK.8.27	And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and in the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am? 
MRK.8.28	And they told him, saying, John the Baptist: and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets. 
MRK.8.29	And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. 
MRK.8.30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. 
MRK.8.31	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
MRK.8.32	And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
MRK.8.33	But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men. 
MRK.8.34	And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
MRK.8.35	For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's shall save it. 
MRK.8.36	For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? 
MRK.8.37	For what should a man give in exchange for his life? 
MRK.8.38	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
MRK.9.1	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There be some here of them that stand 
MRK.9.2	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them: 
MRK.9.3	and his garments became glistering, exceeding white; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. 
MRK.9.4	And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
MRK.9.6	For he wist not what to answer; for they became sore afraid. 
MRK.9.7	And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear ye him. 
MRK.9.8	And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves. 
MRK.9.9	And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean. 
MRK.9.11	And they asked him, saying, The scribes say that Elijah must first come. 
MRK.9.12	And he said unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nought? 
MRK.9.13	But I say unto you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they listed, even as it is written of him.
MRK.9.14	And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them. 
MRK.9.15	And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. 
MRK.9.16	And he asked them, What question ye with them? 
MRK.9.17	And one of the multitude answered him, Master, I brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; 
MRK.9.18	and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able. 
MRK.9.19	And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me. 
MRK.9.20	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. 
MRK.9.21	And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child. 
MRK.9.22	And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. 
MRK.9.23	And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth. 
MRK.9.24	Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 
MRK.9.25	And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. 
MRK.9.26	And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose. 
MRK.9.28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, 
MRK.9.29	And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.
MRK.9.30	And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. 
MRK.9.31	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again. 
MRK.9.32	But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him. 
MRK.9.33	And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning in the way? 
MRK.9.34	But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another in the way, who 
MRK.9.35	And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and minister of all. 
MRK.9.36	And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them, 
MRK.9.37	Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. 
MRK.9.38	John said unto him, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followed not us. 
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. 
MRK.9.40	For he that is not against us is for us.
MRK.9.41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. 
MRK.9.42	And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 
MRK.9.43	And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
MRK.9.45	And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell. 
MRK.9.47	And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell; 
MRK.9.48	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
MRK.9.49	For every one shall be salted with fire. 
MRK.9.50	Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.
MRK.10.1	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the borders of Judaea and beyond Jordan: and multitudes come together unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again. 
MRK.10.2	And there came unto him Pharisees, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away 
MRK.10.3	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? 
MRK.10.4	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. 
MRK.10.5	But Jesus said unto them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. 
MRK.10.6	But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them. 
MRK.10.7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; 
MRK.10.8	and the twain shall become one flesh: so that they are no more twain, but one flesh. 
MRK.10.9	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
MRK.10.10	And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter. 
MRK.10.11	And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her: 
MRK.10.12	and if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.
MRK.10.13	And they brought unto him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them. 
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
MRK.10.15	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein. 
MRK.10.16	And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
MRK.10.17	And as he was going forth into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? 
MRK.10.18	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good save one, 
MRK.10.19	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and mother. 
MRK.10.20	And he said unto him, Master, all these things have I observed from my youth. 
MRK.10.21	And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
MRK.10.22	But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions. 
MRK.10.23	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 
MRK.10.25	It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
MRK.10.26	And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved? 
MRK.10.27	Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God. 
MRK.10.28	Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. 
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel's sake, 
MRK.10.30	but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. 
MRK.10.31	But many 
MRK.10.32	And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him, 
MRK.10.33	, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles: 
MRK.10.34	and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again. 
MRK.10.35	And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee. 
MRK.10.36	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? 
MRK.10.37	And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on 
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
MRK.10.39	And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: 
MRK.10.40	but to sit on my right hand or on 
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John. 
MRK.10.42	And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them. 
MRK.10.43	But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister: 
MRK.10.44	and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all. 
MRK.10.45	For verily the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
MRK.10.46	And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side. 
MRK.10.47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
MRK.10.48	And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
MRK.10.49	And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee. 
MRK.10.50	And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus. 
MRK.10.51	And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight. 
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.
MRK.11.1	And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples, 
MRK.11.2	and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him. 
MRK.11.3	And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither. 
MRK.11.4	And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him. 
MRK.11.5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 
MRK.11.6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go. 
MRK.11.7	And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him. 
MRK.11.8	And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields. 
MRK.11.9	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed 
MRK.11.10	Blessed 
MRK.11.11	And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
MRK.11.12	And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered. 
MRK.11.13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs. 
MRK.11.14	And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it. 
MRK.11.15	And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves; 
MRK.11.16	and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. 
MRK.11.17	And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers. 
MRK.11.18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. 
MRK.11.19	And every evening he went forth out of the city. 
MRK.11.20	And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. 
MRK.11.21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. 
MRK.11.22	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 
MRK.11.23	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it. 
MRK.11.24	Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them, and ye shall have them. 
MRK.11.25	And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
MRK.11.27	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders; 
MRK.11.28	and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things? 
MRK.11.29	And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MRK.11.30	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me. 
MRK.11.31	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
MRK.11.32	But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet. 
MRK.11.33	And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
MRK.12.1	And he began to speak unto them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. 
MRK.12.2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. 
MRK.12.3	And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. 
MRK.12.4	And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully. 
MRK.12.5	And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some. 
MRK.12.6	He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. 
MRK.12.7	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. 
MRK.12.8	And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard. 
MRK.12.9	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. 
MRK.12.10	Have ye not read even this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner: 
MRK.12.11	This was from the Lord, And it is marvelous in our eyes? 
MRK.12.12	And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.
MRK.12.13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk. 
MRK.12.14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
MRK.12.15	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. 
MRK.12.16	And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 
MRK.12.17	And Jesus said unto them, Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. And they marveled greatly at him.
MRK.12.18	And there come unto him Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 
MRK.12.19	Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
MRK.12.20	There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed; 
MRK.12.21	and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise: 
MRK.12.22	and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died. 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. 
MRK.12.24	Jesus said unto them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God? 
MRK.12.25	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven. 
MRK.12.26	But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have ye not read in the book of Moses, in 
MRK.12.27	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: ye do greatly err.
MRK.12.28	And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all? 
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one: 
MRK.12.30	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. 
MRK.12.31	The second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. 
MRK.12.32	And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Master, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he: 
MRK.12.33	and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
MRK.12.34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
MRK.12.35	And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David? 
MRK.12.36	David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. 
MRK.12.37	David himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly. 
MRK.12.38	And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and 
MRK.12.39	and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts: 
MRK.12.40	they which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.
MRK.12.41	And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
MRK.12.42	And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing. 
MRK.12.43	And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they which are casting into the treasury: 
MRK.12.44	for they all did cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, 
MRK.13.1	And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings! 
MRK.13.2	And Jesus said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down. 
MRK.13.3	And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 
MRK.13.4	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what 
MRK.13.5	And Jesus began to say unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray. 
MRK.13.6	Many shall come in my name, saying, I am 
MRK.13.7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not troubled: 
MRK.13.8	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: there shall be earthquakes in divers places; there shall be famines: these things are the beginning of travail. 
MRK.13.9	But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a testimony unto them. 
MRK.13.10	And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations. 
MRK.13.11	And when they lead you 
MRK.13.12	And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
MRK.13.13	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
MRK.13.14	But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains: 
MRK.13.15	and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house: 
MRK.13.16	and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloke. 
MRK.13.17	But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! 
MRK.13.18	And pray ye that it be not in the winter. 
MRK.13.19	For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be. 
MRK.13.20	And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days. 
MRK.13.21	And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there; believe 
MRK.13.22	for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall shew signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect. 
MRK.13.23	But take ye heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
MRK.13.24	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 
MRK.13.25	and the stars shall be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken. 
MRK.13.26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 
MRK.13.27	And then shall he send forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
MRK.13.28	Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh; 
MRK.13.29	even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that he is nigh, 
MRK.13.30	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. 
MRK.13.31	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. 
MRK.13.32	But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. 
MRK.13.33	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
MRK.13.34	 as 
MRK.13.35	Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning; 
MRK.13.36	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. 
MRK.13.37	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
MRK.14.1	Now after two days was 
MRK.14.2	for they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people. 
MRK.14.3	And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of spikenard very costly; 
MRK.14.4	But there were some that had indignation among themselves, 
MRK.14.5	For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. 
MRK.14.7	For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always. 
MRK.14.8	She hath done what she could: she hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying. 
MRK.14.9	And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. 
MRK.14.10	And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them. 
MRK.14.11	And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him 
MRK.14.12	And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover? 
MRK.14.13	And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him; 
MRK.14.14	and wheresoever he shall enter in, say to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
MRK.14.15	And he will himself shew you a large upper room furnished 
MRK.14.16	And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 
MRK.14.17	And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve. 
MRK.14.18	And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, 
MRK.14.19	They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? 
MRK.14.20	And he said unto them, 
MRK.14.21	For the Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. 
MRK.14.22	And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body. 
MRK.14.23	And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it. 
MRK.14.24	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many. 
MRK.14.25	Verily I say unto you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
MRK.14.26	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives. 
MRK.14.27	And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad. 
MRK.14.28	Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. 
MRK.14.29	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. 
MRK.14.30	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that thou today, 
MRK.14.31	But he spake exceeding vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.
MRK.14.32	And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray. 
MRK.14.33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled. 
MRK.14.34	And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch. 
MRK.14.35	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. 
MRK.14.36	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt. 
MRK.14.37	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour? 
MRK.14.38	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
MRK.14.39	And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they wist not what to answer him. 
MRK.14.41	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MRK.14.42	Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
MRK.14.43	And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
MRK.14.44	Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely. 
MRK.14.45	And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him. 
MRK.14.46	And they laid hands on him, and took him. 
MRK.14.47	But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. 
MRK.14.48	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me? 
MRK.14.49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but 
MRK.14.50	And they all left him, and fled. 
MRK.14.51	And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over 
MRK.14.52	but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
MRK.14.53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. 
MRK.14.54	And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light 
MRK.14.55	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not. 
MRK.14.56	For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together. 
MRK.14.57	And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 
MRK.14.58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands. 
MRK.14.59	And not even so did their witness agree together. 
MRK.14.60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
MRK.14.61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 
MRK.14.62	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. 
MRK.14.63	And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death. 
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.
MRK.14.66	And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest; 
MRK.14.67	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, 
MRK.14.68	But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. 
MRK.14.69	And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is 
MRK.14.70	But he again denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, Of a truth thou art 
MRK.14.71	But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak. 
MRK.14.72	And straightway the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
MRK.15.1	And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 
MRK.15.2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest. 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused him of many things. 
MRK.15.4	And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of. 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marveled. 
MRK.15.6	Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. 
MRK.15.7	And there was one called Barabbas, 
MRK.15.8	And the multitude went up and began to ask him 
MRK.15.9	And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
MRK.15.10	For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. 
MRK.15.12	And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
MRK.15.13	And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
MRK.15.14	And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.
MRK.15.15	And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. 
MRK.15.16	And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 
MRK.15.17	And they clothe him with purple, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; 
MRK.15.18	and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
MRK.15.19	And they smote his head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. 
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him. 
MRK.15.21	And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go 
MRK.15.22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
MRK.15.23	And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. 
MRK.15.24	And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take. 
MRK.15.25	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
MRK.15.29	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 
MRK.15.30	save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
MRK.15.31	In like manner also the chief priests mocking 
MRK.15.32	Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.
MRK.15.33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
MRK.15.35	And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah. 
MRK.15.36	And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down. 
MRK.15.37	And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
MRK.15.38	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. 
MRK.15.39	And when the centurion, which stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
MRK.15.40	And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom 
MRK.15.41	who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
MRK.15.42	And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
MRK.15.43	there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honourable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
MRK.15.44	And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 
MRK.15.45	And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the 
MRK.16.1	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the 
MRK.16.2	And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen. 
MRK.16.3	And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb? 
MRK.16.4	and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great. 
MRK.16.5	And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed. 
MRK.16.6	And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, which hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him! 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 
MRK.16.8	And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils. 
MRK.16.10	She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 
MRK.16.11	And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved. 
MRK.16.12	And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country. 
MRK.16.13	And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.
MRK.16.14	And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. 
MRK.16.15	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation. 
MRK.16.16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. 
MRK.16.17	And these signs shall follow them that believe: in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 
MRK.16.18	they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
MRK.16.19	So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. 
MRK.16.20	And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
LUK.1.1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, 
LUK.1.2	even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, 
LUK.1.3	it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus; 
LUK.1.4	that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.
LUK.1.5	There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. 
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
LUK.1.7	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were 
LUK.1.8	Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, 
LUK.1.9	according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense. 
LUK.1.11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	And Zacharias was troubled when he saw 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. 
LUK.1.14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. 
LUK.1.15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. 
LUK.1.16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient 
LUK.1.18	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. 
LUK.1.19	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. 
LUK.1.20	And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. 
LUK.1.21	And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled while he tarried in the temple. 
LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb. 
LUK.1.23	And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house. 
LUK.1.24	And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, 
LUK.1.25	Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon 
LUK.1.26	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
LUK.1.28	And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord 
LUK.1.29	But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. 
LUK.1.30	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
LUK.1.31	And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 
LUK.1.32	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
LUK.1.33	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 
LUK.1.34	And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also that which is to be born shall be called holy, the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren. 
LUK.1.37	For no word from God shall be void of power. 
LUK.1.38	And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
LUK.1.39	And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah; 
LUK.1.40	and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth. 
LUK.1.41	And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost; 
LUK.1.42	and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed 
LUK.1.43	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me? 
LUK.1.44	For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
LUK.1.45	And blessed 
LUK.1.46	And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
LUK.1.47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 
LUK.1.48	For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaiden: For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 
LUK.1.49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; And holy is his name. 
LUK.1.50	And his mercy is unto generations and generations On them that fear him. 
LUK.1.51	He hath shewed strength with his arm; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart. 
LUK.1.52	He hath put down princes from 
LUK.1.53	The hungry he hath filled with good things; And the rich he hath sent empty away. 
LUK.1.54	He hath holpen Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy 
LUK.1.55	(As he spake unto our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever. 
LUK.1.56	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.
LUK.1.57	Now Elisabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. 
LUK.1.58	And her neighbours and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her. 
LUK.1.59	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. 
LUK.1.60	And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. 
LUK.1.61	And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. 
LUK.1.62	And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called. 
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all. 
LUK.1.64	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue 
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. 
LUK.1.66	And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.
LUK.1.67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, 
LUK.1.68	Blessed 
LUK.1.69	And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David 
LUK.1.70	(As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began), 
LUK.1.71	Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; 
LUK.1.72	To shew mercy towards our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant; 
LUK.1.73	The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father, 
LUK.1.74	To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear, 
LUK.1.75	In holiness and righteousness before him all our days. 
LUK.1.76	Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High: For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways; 
LUK.1.77	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins, 
LUK.1.78	Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us, 
LUK.1.79	To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace. 
LUK.1.80	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.
LUK.2.1	Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled. 
LUK.2.2	This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
LUK.2.3	And all went to enroll themselves, every one to his own city. 
LUK.2.4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; 
LUK.2.5	to enroll himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child. 
LUK.2.6	And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. 
LUK.2.7	And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. 
LUK.2.9	And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
LUK.2.10	And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people: 
LUK.2.11	for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
LUK.2.12	And this 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
LUK.2.14	Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased. 
LUK.2.15	And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
LUK.2.16	And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child. 
LUK.2.18	And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. 
LUK.2.19	But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. 
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.
LUK.2.21	And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
LUK.2.22	And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord 
LUK.2.23	(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord), 
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
LUK.2.25	And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 
LUK.2.26	And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. 
LUK.2.27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law, 
LUK.2.28	then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
LUK.2.29	Now lettest thou thy servant depart, O Lord, According to thy word, in peace; 
LUK.2.30	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
LUK.2.31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; 
LUK.2.32	A light for revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of thy people Israel. 
LUK.2.33	And his father and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him; 
LUK.2.34	and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this 
LUK.2.35	yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. 
LUK.2.36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, 
LUK.2.37	and she had been a widow even for fourscore and four years), which departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day. 
LUK.2.38	And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. 
LUK.2.39	And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. 
LUK.2.40	And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
LUK.2.41	And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover. 
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast; 
LUK.2.43	and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not; 
LUK.2.44	but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance: 
LUK.2.45	and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him. 
LUK.2.46	And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions: 
LUK.2.47	and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. 
LUK.2.48	And when they saw him, they were astonished: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing. 
LUK.2.49	And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be in my Father's house? 
LUK.2.50	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. 
LUK.2.51	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all 
LUK.2.52	And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 
LUK.3.2	in the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the region round about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins; 
LUK.3.4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight. 
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, And the rough ways smooth; 
LUK.3.6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. 
LUK.3.7	He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
LUK.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
LUK.3.9	And even now is the axe also laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
LUK.3.10	And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do? 
LUK.3.11	And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise. 
LUK.3.12	And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said unto him, Master, what must we do? 
LUK.3.13	And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you. 
LUK.3.14	And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither exact 
LUK.3.15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ; 
LUK.3.16	John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and 
LUK.3.17	whose fan is in his hand, throughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. 
LUK.3.18	With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people; 
LUK.3.19	but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, 
LUK.3.20	added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. 
LUK.3.23	And Jesus himself, when he began 
LUK.3.24	the 
LUK.3.25	the 
LUK.3.26	the 
LUK.3.27	the 
LUK.3.28	the 
LUK.3.29	the 
LUK.3.30	the 
LUK.3.31	the 
LUK.3.32	the 
LUK.3.33	the 
LUK.3.34	the 
LUK.3.35	the 
LUK.3.36	the 
LUK.3.37	the 
LUK.3.38	the 
LUK.4.1	And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 
LUK.4.2	during forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered. 
LUK.4.3	And the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread. 
LUK.4.4	And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone. 
LUK.4.5	And he led him up, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
LUK.4.6	And the devil said unto him, To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. 
LUK.4.7	If thou therefore wilt worship before me, it shall all be thine. 
LUK.4.8	And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 
LUK.4.9	And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 
LUK.4.10	for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee: 
LUK.4.11	and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 
LUK.4.13	And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season.
LUK.4.14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about. 
LUK.4.15	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. 
LUK.4.16	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read. 
LUK.4.17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written, 
LUK.4.18	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor: He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the blind, To set at liberty them that are bruised, 
LUK.4.19	To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. 
LUK.4.20	And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
LUK.4.21	And he began to say unto them, Today hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears. 
LUK.4.22	And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph's son? 
LUK.4.23	And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country. 
LUK.4.24	And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. 
LUK.4.25	But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land; 
LUK.4.26	and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. 
LUK.4.27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. 
LUK.4.28	And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things; 
LUK.4.29	and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. 
LUK.4.30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way.
LUK.4.31	And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day: 
LUK.4.32	and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority. 
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil; and he cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	Ah! what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
LUK.4.35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt. 
LUK.4.36	And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. 
LUK.4.37	And there went forth a rumour concerning him into every place of the region round about. 
LUK.4.38	And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her. 
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them. 
LUK.4.40	And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 
LUK.4.41	And devils also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. 
LUK.4.42	And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. 
LUK.4.43	But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent. 
LUK.4.44	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
LUK.5.1	Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; 
LUK.5.2	and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat. 
LUK.5.4	And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. 
LUK.5.5	And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets. 
LUK.5.6	And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking; 
LUK.5.7	and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 
LUK.5.8	But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
LUK.5.9	For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken; 
LUK.5.10	and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. 
LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.
LUK.5.12	And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
LUK.5.13	And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him. 
LUK.5.14	And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
LUK.5.15	But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. 
LUK.5.16	But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.
LUK.5.17	And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal. 
LUK.5.18	And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him. 
LUK.5.19	And not finding by what 
LUK.5.20	And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. 
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
LUK.5.22	But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
LUK.5.23	Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk? 
LUK.5.24	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house. 
LUK.5.25	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. 
LUK.5.26	And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.
LUK.5.27	And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me. 
LUK.5.28	And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him. 
LUK.5.29	And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them. 
LUK.5.30	And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners? 
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician; but they that are sick. 
LUK.5.32	I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. 
LUK.5.33	And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the 
LUK.5.34	And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 
LUK.5.35	But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days. 
LUK.5.36	And he spake also a parable unto them; No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old. 
LUK.5.37	And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish. 
LUK.5.38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 
LUK.5.39	And no man having drunk old 
LUK.6.1	Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the cornfields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. 
LUK.6.2	But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day? 
LUK.6.3	And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was an hungred, he, and they that were with him; 
LUK.6.4	how he entered into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone? 
LUK.6.5	And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath. 
LUK.6.6	And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered. 
LUK.6.7	And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him. 
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. 
LUK.6.9	And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it? 
LUK.6.10	And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did 
LUK.6.11	But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God. 
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called his disciples: and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles; 
LUK.6.14	Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	and Matthew and Thomas, and James 
LUK.6.16	and Judas 
LUK.6.17	and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
LUK.6.18	and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed. 
LUK.6.19	And all the multitude sought to touch him: for power came forth from him, and healed 
LUK.6.20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed 
LUK.6.21	Blessed 
LUK.6.22	Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you 
LUK.6.23	Rejoice in that day, and leap 
LUK.6.24	But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. 
LUK.6.25	Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe 
LUK.6.26	Woe 
LUK.6.27	But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, 
LUK.6.28	bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you. 
LUK.6.29	To him that smiteth thee on the 
LUK.6.30	Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
LUK.6.31	And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
LUK.6.32	And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them. 
LUK.6.33	And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same. 
LUK.6.34	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much. 
LUK.6.35	But love your enemies, and do 
LUK.6.36	Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
LUK.6.37	And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released: 
LUK.6.38	give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again. 
LUK.6.39	And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit? 
LUK.6.40	The disciple is not above his master: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his master. 
LUK.6.41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
LUK.6.42	Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. 
LUK.6.43	For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit. 
LUK.6.44	For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 
LUK.6.45	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil 
LUK.6.46	And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
LUK.6.47	Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: 
LUK.6.48	he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded. 
LUK.6.49	But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.
LUK.7.1	After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death. 
LUK.7.3	And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant. 
LUK.7.4	And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him: 
LUK.7.5	for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue. 
LUK.7.6	And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: 
LUK.7.7	wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 
LUK.7.9	And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
LUK.7.10	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
LUK.7.11	And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. 
LUK.7.12	Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. 
LUK.7.13	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. 
LUK.7.14	And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. 
LUK.7.15	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. 
LUK.7.16	And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people. 
LUK.7.17	And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about. 
LUK.7.18	And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
LUK.7.19	And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? 
LUK.7.20	And when the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? 
LUK.7.21	In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. 
LUK.7.22	And he answered and said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them. 
LUK.7.23	And blessed is he, whosoever shall find none occasion of stumbling in me. 
LUK.7.24	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? 
LUK.7.25	But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. 
LUK.7.26	But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. 
LUK.7.27	This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee. 
LUK.7.28	I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
LUK.7.29	And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him. 
LUK.7.31	Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like? 
LUK.7.32	They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; which say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep. 
LUK.7.33	For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. 
LUK.7.34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
LUK.7.35	And wisdom is justified of all her children.
LUK.7.36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. 
LUK.7.37	And behold, a woman which was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment, 
LUK.7.38	and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is which touched him, that she is a sinner. 
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 
LUK.7.41	A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
LUK.7.42	When they had not 
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
LUK.7.44	And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. 
LUK.7.45	Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 
LUK.7.46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. 
LUK.7.47	Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, 
LUK.7.48	And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
LUK.7.49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? 
LUK.7.50	And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
LUK.8.1	And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve, 
LUK.8.2	and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven devils had gone out, 
LUK.8.3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto them of their substance.
LUK.8.4	And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable: 
LUK.8.5	The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it. 
LUK.8.6	And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. 
LUK.8.7	And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. 
LUK.8.8	And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him what this parable might be. 
LUK.8.10	And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. 
LUK.8.11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 
LUK.8.12	And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. 
LUK.8.13	And those on the rock 
LUK.8.14	And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of 
LUK.8.15	And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience. 
LUK.8.16	And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they which enter in may see the light. 
LUK.8.17	For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor 
LUK.8.18	Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath. 
LUK.8.19	And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. 
LUK.8.21	But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
LUK.8.22	Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. 
LUK.8.23	But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling 
LUK.8.24	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
LUK.8.25	And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him? 
LUK.8.26	And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had devils; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in 
LUK.8.28	And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not. 
LUK.8.29	For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the devil into the deserts. 
LUK.8.30	And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many devils were entered into him. 
LUK.8.31	And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. 
LUK.8.32	Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave. 
LUK.8.33	And the devils came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were choked. 
LUK.8.34	And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. 
LUK.8.35	And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the devils were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid. 
LUK.8.36	And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with devils was made whole. 
LUK.8.37	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned. 
LUK.8.38	But the man from whom the devils were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him. 
LUK.8.41	And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him to come into his house; 
LUK.8.42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him. 
LUK.8.43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any, 
LUK.8.44	came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched. 
LUK.8.45	And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush 
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, Some one did touch me: for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. 
LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately. 
LUK.8.48	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. 
LUK.8.49	While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's 
LUK.8.50	But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole. 
LUK.8.51	And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother. 
LUK.8.52	And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth. 
LUK.8.53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
LUK.8.54	But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise. 
LUK.8.55	And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that 
LUK.8.56	And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.
LUK.9.1	And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. 
LUK.9.2	And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats. 
LUK.9.4	And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart. 
LUK.9.5	And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them. 
LUK.9.6	And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere. 
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead; 
LUK.9.8	and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 
LUK.9.9	And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
LUK.9.10	And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. 
LUK.9.11	But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he healed. 
LUK.9.12	And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. 
LUK.9.13	But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people. 
LUK.9.14	For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each. 
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
LUK.9.17	And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	And it came to pass, as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am? 
LUK.9.19	And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others 
LUK.9.20	And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God. 
LUK.9.21	But he charged them, and commanded 
LUK.9.22	saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. 
LUK.9.23	And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. 
LUK.9.24	For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. 
LUK.9.25	For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self? 
LUK.9.26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and 
LUK.9.27	But I tell you of a truth, There be some of them that stand here, which shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
LUK.9.28	And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment 
LUK.9.30	And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elijah; 
LUK.9.31	who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. 
LUK.9.33	And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said. 
LUK.9.34	And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
LUK.9.35	And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him. 
LUK.9.36	And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.
LUK.9.37	And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. 
LUK.9.38	And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Master, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child: 
LUK.9.39	and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely. 
LUK.9.40	And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not. 
LUK.9.41	And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son. 
LUK.9.42	And as he was yet a coming, the devil dashed him down, and tare 
LUK.9.43	And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples, 
LUK.9.44	Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men. 
LUK.9.45	But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it: and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. 
LUK.9.46	And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. 
LUK.9.47	But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side, 
LUK.9.48	and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great. 
LUK.9.49	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. 
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said unto him, Forbid 
LUK.9.51	And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
LUK.9.52	and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
LUK.9.53	And they did not receive him, because his face was 
LUK.9.54	And when his disciples James and John saw 
LUK.9.55	But he turned, and rebuked them. 
LUK.9.56	And they went to another village.
LUK.9.57	And as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven 
LUK.9.59	And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
LUK.9.60	But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God. 
LUK.9.61	And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house. 
LUK.9.62	But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
LUK.10.1	Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come. 
LUK.10.2	And he said unto them, The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his harvest. 
LUK.10.3	Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. 
LUK.10.4	Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes: and salute no man on the way. 
LUK.10.5	And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace 
LUK.10.6	And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again. 
LUK.10.7	And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 
LUK.10.8	And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 
LUK.10.9	and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
LUK.10.10	But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, 
LUK.10.11	Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we do wipe off against you: howbeit know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh. 
LUK.10.12	I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 
LUK.10.13	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
LUK.10.14	Howbeit it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgement, than for you. 
LUK.10.15	And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades. 
LUK.10.16	He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.
LUK.10.17	And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us in thy name. 
LUK.10.18	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. 
LUK.10.19	Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you. 
LUK.10.20	Howbeit in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. 
LUK.10.21	In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. 
LUK.10.22	All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal 
LUK.10.23	And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed 
LUK.10.24	for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
LUK.10.25	And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
LUK.10.26	And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 
LUK.10.27	And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
LUK.10.28	And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. 
LUK.10.29	But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 
LUK.10.30	Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, which both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
LUK.10.31	And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
LUK.10.32	And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. 
LUK.10.33	But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, 
LUK.10.34	and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on 
LUK.10.35	And on the morrow he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee. 
LUK.10.36	Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbour unto him that fell among the robbers? 
LUK.10.37	And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
LUK.10.38	Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. 
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 
LUK.10.41	But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: 
LUK.10.42	but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
LUK.11.1	And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. 
LUK.11.2	And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. 
LUK.11.3	Give us day by day our daily bread. 
LUK.11.4	And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation. 
LUK.11.5	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 
LUK.11.6	for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; 
LUK.11.7	and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee? 
LUK.11.8	I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth. 
LUK.11.9	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
LUK.11.10	For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
LUK.11.11	And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent? 
LUK.11.12	Or 
LUK.11.13	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall 
LUK.11.14	And he was casting out a devil 
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. 
LUK.11.16	And others, tempting 
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house 
LUK.11.18	And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils by Beelzebub. 
LUK.11.19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. 
LUK.11.20	But if I by the finger of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. 
LUK.11.21	When the strong 
LUK.11.22	but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. 
LUK.11.23	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. 
LUK.11.24	The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out. 
LUK.11.25	And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished. 
LUK.11.26	Then goeth he, and taketh 
LUK.11.27	And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck. 
LUK.11.28	But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
LUK.11.29	And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah. 
LUK.11.30	For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. 
LUK.11.31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgement with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 
LUK.11.32	The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. 
LUK.11.33	No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light. 
LUK.11.34	The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. 
LUK.11.35	Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness. 
LUK.11.36	If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light.
LUK.11.37	Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 
LUK.11.38	And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner. 
LUK.11.39	And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. 
LUK.11.40	Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also? 
LUK.11.41	Howbeit give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you. 
LUK.11.42	But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over judgement and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. 
LUK.11.43	Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces. 
LUK.11.44	Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which appear not, and the men that walk over 
LUK.11.45	And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Master, in saying this thou reproachest us also. 
LUK.11.46	And he said, Woe unto you lawyers also! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. 
LUK.11.47	Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 
LUK.11.48	So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build 
LUK.11.49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and 
LUK.11.50	that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 
LUK.11.51	from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation. 
LUK.11.52	Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 
LUK.11.53	And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon 
LUK.11.54	laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.
LUK.12.1	In the mean time, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 
LUK.12.2	But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed: and hid, that shall not be known. 
LUK.12.3	Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. 
LUK.12.4	And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them which kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 
LUK.12.5	But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. 
LUK.12.6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God. 
LUK.12.7	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows. 
LUK.12.8	And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 
LUK.12.9	but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God. 
LUK.12.10	And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. 
LUK.12.11	And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: 
LUK.12.12	for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.
LUK.12.13	And one out of the multitude said unto him, Master, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. 
LUK.12.14	But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 
LUK.12.15	And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. 
LUK.12.16	And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 
LUK.12.17	and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits? 
LUK.12.18	And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my corn and my goods. 
LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. 
LUK.12.20	But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be? 
LUK.12.21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
LUK.12.22	And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for 
LUK.12.23	For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment. 
LUK.12.24	Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds! 
LUK.12.25	And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto his stature? 
LUK.12.26	If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest? 
LUK.12.27	Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
LUK.12.28	But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more 
LUK.12.29	And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 
LUK.12.30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. 
LUK.12.31	Howbeit seek ye his kingdom, and these things shall be added unto you. 
LUK.12.32	Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 
LUK.12.33	Sell that ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth destroyeth. 
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
LUK.12.35	Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; 
LUK.12.36	and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him. 
LUK.12.37	Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them. 
LUK.12.38	And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find 
LUK.12.39	But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through. 
LUK.12.40	Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.
LUK.12.41	And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all? 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season? 
LUK.12.43	Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 
LUK.12.44	Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath. 
LUK.12.45	But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; 
LUK.12.46	the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful. 
LUK.12.47	And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many 
LUK.12.48	but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few 
LUK.12.49	I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what will I, if it is already kindled? 
LUK.12.50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! 
LUK.12.51	Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: 
LUK.12.52	for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. 
LUK.12.53	They shall be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.
LUK.12.54	And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass. 
LUK.12.55	And when 
LUK.12.56	Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time? 
LUK.12.57	And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? 
LUK.12.58	For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he hale thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison. 
LUK.12.59	I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the very last mite.
LUK.13.1	Now there were some present at that very season which told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these things? 
LUK.13.3	I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish. 
LUK.13.4	Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem? 
LUK.13.5	I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
LUK.13.6	And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. 
LUK.13.7	And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground? 
LUK.13.8	And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 
LUK.13.9	and if it bear fruit thenceforth, 
LUK.13.10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day. 
LUK.13.11	And behold, a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up. 
LUK.13.12	And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. 
LUK.13.13	And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. 
LUK.13.14	And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath. 
LUK.13.15	But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? 
LUK.13.16	And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, 
LUK.13.17	And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK.13.18	He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it? 
LUK.13.19	It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof. 
LUK.13.20	And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? 
LUK.13.21	It is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened. 
LUK.13.22	And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem.
LUK.13.23	And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that be saved? And he said unto them, 
LUK.13.24	Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able. 
LUK.13.25	When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are; 
LUK.13.26	then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets; 
LUK.13.27	and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. 
LUK.13.28	There shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without. 
LUK.13.29	And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.13.30	And behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
LUK.13.31	In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee. 
LUK.13.32	And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out devils and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third 
LUK.13.33	Howbeit I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the 
LUK.13.34	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen 
LUK.13.35	Behold, your house is left unto you 
LUK.14.1	And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him. 
LUK.14.2	And behold, there was before him a certain man which had the dropsy. 
LUK.14.3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not? 
LUK.14.4	But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. 
LUK.14.5	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day? 
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer again unto these things.
LUK.14.7	And he spake a parable unto those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them, 
LUK.14.8	When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him, 
LUK.14.9	and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. 
LUK.14.10	But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee. 
LUK.14.11	For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. 
LUK.14.12	And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbours; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. 
LUK.14.13	But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 
LUK.14.14	and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not 
LUK.14.15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.14.16	But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many: 
LUK.14.17	and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for 
LUK.14.18	And they all with one 
LUK.14.19	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. 
LUK.14.20	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 
LUK.14.21	And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame. 
LUK.14.22	And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room. 
LUK.14.23	And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain 
LUK.14.24	For I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
LUK.14.25	Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them, 
LUK.14.26	If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 
LUK.14.27	Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. 
LUK.14.28	For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have 
LUK.14.29	Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him, 
LUK.14.30	saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
LUK.14.31	Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 
LUK.14.32	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace. 
LUK.14.33	So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. 
LUK.14.34	Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? 
LUK.14.35	It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: 
LUK.15.1	Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him for to hear him. 
LUK.15.2	And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. 
LUK.15.3	And he spake unto them this parable, saying, 
LUK.15.4	What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? 
LUK.15.5	And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
LUK.15.6	And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and his neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. 
LUK.15.7	I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, 
LUK.15.8	Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it? 
LUK.15.9	And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. 
LUK.15.10	Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
LUK.15.11	And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
LUK.15.12	and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of 
LUK.15.13	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. 
LUK.15.14	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. 
LUK.15.15	And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. 
LUK.15.16	And he would fain have been filled with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. 
LUK.15.17	But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! 
LUK.15.18	I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: 
LUK.15.19	I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. 
LUK.15.20	And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 
LUK.15.21	And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son. 
LUK.15.22	But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 
LUK.15.23	and bring the fatted calf, 
LUK.15.24	for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. 
LUK.15.25	Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
LUK.15.26	And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be. 
LUK.15.27	And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 
LUK.15.28	But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him. 
LUK.15.29	But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine: and 
LUK.15.30	but when this thy son came, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf. 
LUK.15.31	And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine. 
LUK.15.32	But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive 
LUK.16.1	And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. 
LUK.16.2	And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward. 
LUK.16.3	And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
LUK.16.4	I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
LUK.16.5	And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 
LUK.16.6	And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. 
LUK.16.7	Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore. 
LUK.16.8	And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. 
LUK.16.9	And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. 
LUK.16.10	He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. 
LUK.16.11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true 
LUK.16.12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? 
LUK.16.13	No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 
LUK.16.14	And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. 
LUK.16.15	And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. 
LUK.16.16	The law and the prophets 
LUK.16.17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall. 
LUK.16.18	Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.
LUK.16.19	Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: 
LUK.16.20	and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, 
LUK.16.21	and desiring to be fed with the 
LUK.16.22	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. 
LUK.16.23	And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
LUK.16.24	And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. 
LUK.16.25	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish. 
LUK.16.26	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they which would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us. 
LUK.16.27	And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house; 
LUK.16.28	for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
LUK.16.29	But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
LUK.16.30	And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. 
LUK.16.31	And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.
LUK.17.1	And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! 
LUK.17.2	It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. 
LUK.17.3	Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 
LUK.17.4	And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. 
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you. 
LUK.17.7	But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat; 
LUK.17.8	and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
LUK.17.9	Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded? 
LUK.17.10	Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.
LUK.17.11	And it came to pass, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, that he was passing through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: 
LUK.17.13	and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 
LUK.17.14	And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed. 
LUK.17.15	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God; 
LUK.17.16	and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 
LUK.17.17	And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine? 
LUK.17.18	Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger? 
LUK.17.19	And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
LUK.17.20	And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 
LUK.17.21	neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you. 
LUK.17.22	And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. 
LUK.17.23	And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after 
LUK.17.24	for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day. 
LUK.17.25	But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation. 
LUK.17.26	And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 
LUK.17.27	They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.28	Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
LUK.17.29	but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: 
LUK.17.30	after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed. 
LUK.17.31	In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back. 
LUK.17.32	Remember Lot's wife. 
LUK.17.33	Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose 
LUK.17.34	I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 
LUK.17.35	There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
LUK.17.37	And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body 
LUK.18.1	And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint; 
LUK.18.2	saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, and regarded not man: 
LUK.18.3	and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. 
LUK.18.4	And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 
LUK.18.5	yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming. 
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith. 
LUK.18.7	And shall not God avenge his elect, which cry to him day and night, and he is longsuffering over them? 
LUK.18.8	I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Howbeit when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
LUK.18.9	And he spake also this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought: 
LUK.18.10	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
LUK.18.11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 
LUK.18.12	I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get. 
LUK.18.13	But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner. 
LUK.18.14	I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
LUK.18.15	And they brought unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
LUK.18.17	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
LUK.18.18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, 
LUK.18.20	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother. 
LUK.18.21	And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up. 
LUK.18.22	And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
LUK.18.23	But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich. 
LUK.18.24	And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
LUK.18.25	For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
LUK.18.26	And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved? 
LUK.18.27	But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. 
LUK.18.28	And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee. 
LUK.18.29	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, 
LUK.18.30	who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.
LUK.18.31	And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man. 
LUK.18.32	For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully entreated, and spit upon: 
LUK.18.33	and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. 
LUK.18.34	And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.
LUK.18.35	And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 
LUK.18.36	and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant. 
LUK.18.37	And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
LUK.18.38	And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
LUK.18.39	And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
LUK.18.40	And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
LUK.18.41	What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole. 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
LUK.19.1	And he entered and was passing through Jericho. 
LUK.19.2	And behold, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. 
LUK.19.3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature. 
LUK.19.4	And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. 
LUK.19.5	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house. 
LUK.19.6	And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner. 
LUK.19.8	And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold. 
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said unto him, Today is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 
LUK.19.10	For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
LUK.19.11	And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and 
LUK.19.12	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
LUK.19.13	And he called ten servants of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye 
LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us. 
LUK.19.15	And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading. 
LUK.19.16	And the first came before him, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more. 
LUK.19.17	And he said unto him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds. 
LUK.19.19	And he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities. 
LUK.19.20	And another came, saying, Lord, behold, 
LUK.19.21	for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. 
LUK.19.22	He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow; 
LUK.19.23	then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest? 
LUK.19.24	And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds. 
LUK.19.25	And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds. 
LUK.19.26	I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him. 
LUK.19.27	Howbeit these mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
LUK.19.28	And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.29	And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called 
LUK.19.30	saying, Go your way into the village over against 
LUK.19.31	And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him. 
LUK.19.32	And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them. 
LUK.19.33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? 
LUK.19.34	And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 
LUK.19.35	And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon. 
LUK.19.36	And as he went, they spread their garments in the way. 
LUK.19.37	And as he was now drawing nigh, 
LUK.19.38	saying, Blessed 
LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
LUK.19.40	And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
LUK.19.41	And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it, 
LUK.19.42	saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. 
LUK.19.43	For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, 
LUK.19.44	and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. 
LUK.19.45	And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold, 
LUK.19.46	saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers. 
LUK.19.47	And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him: 
LUK.19.48	and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.
LUK.20.1	And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders; 
LUK.20.2	and they spake, saying unto him, Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
LUK.20.3	And he answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me: 
LUK.20.4	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? 
LUK.20.5	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him? 
LUK.20.6	But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. 
LUK.20.7	And they answered, that they knew not whence 
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
LUK.20.9	And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time. 
LUK.20.10	And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. 
LUK.20.11	And he sent yet another servant: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty. 
LUK.20.12	And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth. 
LUK.20.13	And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him. 
LUK.20.14	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 
LUK.20.15	And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them? 
LUK.20.16	He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. 
LUK.20.17	But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner? 
LUK.20.18	Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust. 
LUK.20.19	And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.
LUK.20.20	And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor. 
LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person 
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
LUK.20.23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, 
LUK.20.24	Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar's. 
LUK.20.25	And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. 
LUK.20.26	And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.
LUK.20.27	And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they which say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, 
LUK.20.28	saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man's brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
LUK.20.29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless; 
LUK.20.30	and the second; 
LUK.20.31	and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died. 
LUK.20.32	Afterward the woman also died. 
LUK.20.33	In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife. 
LUK.20.34	And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage: 
LUK.20.35	but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 
LUK.20.36	for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 
LUK.20.37	But that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed, in 
LUK.20.38	Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
LUK.20.39	And certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said. 
LUK.20.40	For they durst not any more ask him any question. 
LUK.20.41	And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David's son? 
LUK.20.42	For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
LUK.20.43	Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. 
LUK.20.44	David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son? 
LUK.20.45	And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
LUK.20.46	Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts; 
LUK.20.47	which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.
LUK.21.1	And he looked up, and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury. 
LUK.21.2	And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. 
LUK.21.3	And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all: 
LUK.21.4	for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts: but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had.
LUK.21.5	And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said, 
LUK.21.6	As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, Master, when therefore shall these things be? and what 
LUK.21.8	And he said, Take heed that ye be not led astray: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am 
LUK.21.9	And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to pass first; but the end is not immediately. 
LUK.21.10	Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 
LUK.21.11	and there shall be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven. 
LUK.21.12	But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake. 
LUK.21.13	It shall turn unto you for a testimony. 
LUK.21.14	Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer: 
LUK.21.15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay. 
LUK.21.16	But ye shall be delivered up even by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and 
LUK.21.17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake. 
LUK.21.18	And not a hair of your head shall perish. 
LUK.21.19	In your patience ye shall win your souls.
LUK.21.20	But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. 
LUK.21.21	Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein. 
LUK.21.22	For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 
LUK.21.23	Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people. 
LUK.21.24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 
LUK.21.25	And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows; 
LUK.21.26	men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. 
LUK.21.27	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
LUK.21.28	But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.
LUK.21.29	And he spake to them a parable: Behold the fig tree, and all the trees: 
LUK.21.30	when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh. 
LUK.21.31	Even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh. 
LUK.21.32	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished. 
LUK.21.33	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. 
LUK.21.34	But take heed to yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a snare: 
LUK.21.35	for 
LUK.21.36	But watch ye at every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. 
LUK.21.37	And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called 
LUK.21.38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
LUK.22.1	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. 
LUK.22.2	And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people. 
LUK.22.3	And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 
LUK.22.4	And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto them. 
LUK.22.5	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK.22.7	And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed. 
LUK.22.8	And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat. 
LUK.22.9	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready? 
LUK.22.10	And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth. 
LUK.22.11	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
LUK.22.12	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. 
LUK.22.13	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 
LUK.22.14	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him. 
LUK.22.15	And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: 
LUK.22.16	for I say unto you, I will not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.22.17	And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: 
LUK.22.18	for I say unto you, I will not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. 
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
LUK.22.20	And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, 
LUK.22.21	But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. 
LUK.22.22	For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed! 
LUK.22.23	And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 
LUK.22.24	And there arose also a contention among them, which of them is accounted to be greatest. 
LUK.22.25	And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors. 
LUK.22.26	But ye 
LUK.22.27	For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth. 
LUK.22.28	But ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations; 
LUK.22.29	and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me, 
LUK.22.30	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
LUK.22.31	Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: 
LUK.22.32	but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not: and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, stablish thy brethren. 
LUK.22.33	And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death. 
LUK.22.34	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. 
LUK.22.35	And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. 
LUK.22.36	And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet: and he that hath none, let him sell his cloke, and buy a sword. 
LUK.22.37	For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfillment. 
LUK.22.38	And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
LUK.22.39	And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him. 
LUK.22.40	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. 
LUK.22.41	And he was parted from them about a stone's cast; and he kneeled down and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. 
LUK.22.43	And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 
LUK.22.44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. 
LUK.22.45	And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, 
LUK.22.46	and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
LUK.22.47	While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. 
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? 
LUK.22.49	And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
LUK.22.50	And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear. 
LUK.22.51	But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
LUK.22.52	And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, which were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves? 
LUK.22.53	When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
LUK.22.54	And they seized him, and led him 
LUK.22.55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them. 
LUK.22.56	And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light 
LUK.22.57	But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art 
LUK.22.59	And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. 
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 
LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
LUK.22.62	And he went out, and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	And the men that held 
LUK.22.64	And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee? 
LUK.22.65	And many other things spake they against him, reviling him. 
LUK.22.66	And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying, 
LUK.22.67	If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 
LUK.22.68	and if I ask 
LUK.22.69	But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God. 
LUK.22.70	And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. 
LUK.22.71	And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.
LUK.23.1	And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. 
LUK.23.3	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest. 
LUK.23.4	And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man. 
LUK.23.5	But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. 
LUK.23.6	But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 
LUK.23.7	And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days. 
LUK.23.8	Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. 
LUK.23.9	And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. 
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
LUK.23.13	And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
LUK.23.14	and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 
LUK.23.15	no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. 
LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
LUK.23.18	But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: 
LUK.23.19	one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison. 
LUK.23.20	And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus; 
LUK.23.21	but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him. 
LUK.23.22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him. 
LUK.23.23	But they were instant with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done. 
LUK.23.25	And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
LUK.23.26	And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus. 
LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
LUK.23.29	For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck. 
LUK.23.30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. 
LUK.23.31	For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
LUK.23.32	And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 
LUK.23.33	And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left. 
LUK.23.34	And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots. 
LUK.23.35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen. 
LUK.23.36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar, 
LUK.23.37	and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself. 
LUK.23.38	And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
LUK.23.39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us. 
LUK.23.40	But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
LUK.23.42	And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom. 
LUK.23.43	And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
LUK.23.44	And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, 
LUK.23.45	the sun's light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
LUK.23.46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost. 
LUK.23.47	And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
LUK.23.48	And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts. 
LUK.23.49	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.
LUK.23.50	And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a righteous 
LUK.23.51	(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), 
LUK.23.52	this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain. 
LUK.23.54	And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
LUK.23.55	And the women, which had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid. 
LUK.23.56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 
LUK.24.3	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel: 
LUK.24.5	and as they were affrighted, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words, 
LUK.24.9	and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. 
LUK.24.10	Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the 
LUK.24.11	And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.
LUK.24.13	And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.14	And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened. 
LUK.24.15	And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
LUK.24.17	And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad. 
LUK.24.18	And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
LUK.24.19	And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
LUK.24.20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
LUK.24.21	But we hoped that it was he which should redeem Israel. Yea and beside all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. 
LUK.24.22	Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb; 
LUK.24.23	and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
LUK.24.24	And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
LUK.24.25	And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! 
LUK.24.26	Behoved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? 
LUK.24.27	And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
LUK.24.28	And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further. 
LUK.24.29	And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them. 
LUK.24.30	And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. 
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
LUK.24.32	And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures? 
LUK.24.33	And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
LUK.24.34	saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
LUK.24.35	And they rehearsed the things 
LUK.24.36	And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace 
LUK.24.37	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. 
LUK.24.38	And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings arise in your heart? 
LUK.24.39	See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. 
LUK.24.40	And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his feet. 
LUK.24.41	And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? 
LUK.24.42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish. 
LUK.24.43	And he took it, and did eat before them. 
LUK.24.44	And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, how that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me. 
LUK.24.45	Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures; 
LUK.24.46	and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day; 
LUK.24.47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.48	Ye are witnesses of these things. 
LUK.24.49	And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.
LUK.24.50	And he led them out until 
LUK.24.51	And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 
LUK.24.53	and were continually in the temple, blessing God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	The same was in the beginning with God. 
JHN.1.3	All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made. 
JHN.1.4	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
JHN.1.5	And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not. 
JHN.1.6	There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. 
JHN.1.7	The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him. 
JHN.1.8	He was not the light, but 
JHN.1.9	There was the true light, 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 
JHN.1.11	He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not. 
JHN.1.12	But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, 
JHN.1.13	which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 
JHN.1.14	And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.
JHN.1.15	John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me. 
JHN.1.16	For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace. 
JHN.1.17	For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared 
JHN.1.19	And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou? 
JHN.1.20	And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ. 
JHN.1.21	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. 
JHN.1.22	They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 
JHN.1.23	He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet. 
JHN.1.24	And they had been sent from the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet? 
JHN.1.26	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not, 
JHN.1.27	 he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose. 
JHN.1.28	These things were done in Bethany beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is become before me: for he was before me. 
JHN.1.31	And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing with water. 
JHN.1.32	And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him. 
JHN.1.33	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit. 
JHN.1.34	And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God. 
JHN.1.35	Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples; 
JHN.1.36	and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!
JHN.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where abidest thou? 
JHN.1.39	He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. 
JHN.1.40	One of the two that heard John 
JHN.1.41	He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). 
JHN.1.42	He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).
JHN.1.43	On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me. 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. 
JHN.1.45	Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
JHN.1.46	And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. 
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel. 
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. 
JHN.1.51	And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
JHN.2.1	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
JHN.2.2	and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
JHN.2.3	And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 
JHN.2.4	And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 
JHN.2.5	His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 
JHN.2.6	Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
JHN.2.7	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
JHN.2.8	And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it. 
JHN.2.9	And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants which had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom, 
JHN.2.10	and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when 
JHN.2.11	This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
JHN.2.12	After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and 
JHN.2.13	And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
JHN.2.15	and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables; 
JHN.2.16	and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. 
JHN.2.17	His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house shall eat me up. 
JHN.2.18	The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
JHN.2.20	The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? 
JHN.2.21	But he spake of the temple of his body. 
JHN.2.22	When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
JHN.2.23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did. 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men, 
JHN.2.25	and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
JHN.3.2	The same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him. 
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
JHN.3.6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
JHN.3.7	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew. 
JHN.3.8	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? 
JHN.3.11	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and bear witness of that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 
JHN.3.12	If I told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you heavenly things? 
JHN.3.13	And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, 
JHN.3.14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
JHN.3.15	that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life. 
JHN.3.16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life. 
JHN.3.17	For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him. 
JHN.3.18	He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
JHN.3.19	And this is the judgement, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. 
JHN.3.20	For every one that doeth ill hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved. 
JHN.3.21	But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.
JHN.3.22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
JHN.3.23	And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
JHN.3.24	For John was not yet cast into prison. 
JHN.3.25	There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. 
JHN.3.26	And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. 
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him. 
JHN.3.29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I must decrease. 
JHN.3.31	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 
JHN.3.32	What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness. 
JHN.3.33	He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to 
JHN.3.34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. 
JHN.3.36	He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
JHN.4.1	When therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 
JHN.4.2	(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples), 
JHN.4.3	he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
JHN.4.4	And he must needs pass through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph: 
JHN.4.6	and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
JHN.4.7	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
JHN.4.8	For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. 
JHN.4.9	The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
JHN.4.11	The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
JHN.4.12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
JHN.4.14	but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. 
JHN.4.15	The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw. 
JHN.4.16	Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: 
JHN.4.18	for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. 
JHN.4.19	The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
JHN.4.21	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. 
JHN.4.22	Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know: for salvation is from the Jews. 
JHN.4.23	But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. 
JHN.4.24	God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth. 
JHN.4.25	The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (which is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things. 
JHN.4.26	Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am 
JHN.4.27	And upon this came his disciples; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? 
JHN.4.28	So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men, 
JHN.4.29	Come, see a man, which told me all things that 
JHN.4.30	They went out of the city, and were coming to him. 
JHN.4.31	In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat. 
JHN.4.32	But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not. 
JHN.4.33	The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him 
JHN.4.34	Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work. 
JHN.4.35	Say not ye, There are yet four months, and 
JHN.4.36	He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 
JHN.4.37	For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
JHN.4.38	I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour. 
JHN.4.39	And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days. 
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of his word; 
JHN.4.42	and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
JHN.4.43	And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
JHN.4.45	So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 
JHN.4.46	He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought 
JHN.4.48	Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. 
JHN.4.49	The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
JHN.4.50	Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way. 
JHN.4.51	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived. 
JHN.4.52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that 
JHN.4.54	This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.
JHN.5.1	After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.5.2	Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep 
JHN.5.3	In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered.
JHN.5.5	And a certain man was there, which had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time 
JHN.5.7	The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
JHN.5.8	Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
JHN.5.9	And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day. 
JHN.5.10	So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. 
JHN.5.11	But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
JHN.5.12	They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up 
JHN.5.13	But he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place. 
JHN.5.14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee. 
JHN.5.15	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole. 
JHN.5.16	And for this cause did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
JHN.5.17	But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work. 
JHN.5.18	For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. 
JHN.5.19	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. 
JHN.5.20	For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that ye may marvel. 
JHN.5.21	For as the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom he will. 
JHN.5.22	For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgement unto the Son; 
JHN.5.23	that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which sent him. 
JHN.5.24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgement, but hath passed out of death into life. 
JHN.5.25	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. 
JHN.5.26	For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself: 
JHN.5.27	and he gave him authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of man. 
JHN.5.28	Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, 
JHN.5.29	And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done ill, unto the resurrection of judgement. 
JHN.5.30	I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgement is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
JHN.5.31	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
JHN.5.32	It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 
JHN.5.33	Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth. 
JHN.5.34	But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved. 
JHN.5.35	He was the lamp that burneth and shineth: and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. 
JHN.5.36	But the witness which I have is greater than 
JHN.5.37	And the Father which sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. 
JHN.5.38	And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. 
JHN.5.39	Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me; 
JHN.5.40	and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. 
JHN.5.41	I receive not glory from men. 
JHN.5.42	But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves. 
JHN.5.43	I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 
JHN.5.44	How can ye believe, which receive glory one of another, and the glory that 
JHN.5.45	Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, 
JHN.5.46	For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. 
JHN.5.47	But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
JHN.6.1	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is 
JHN.6.2	And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick. 
JHN.6.3	And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. 
JHN.6.5	Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat? 
JHN.6.6	And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little. 
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, 
JHN.6.9	There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many? 
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
JHN.6.11	Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would. 
JHN.6.12	And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost. 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten. 
JHN.6.14	When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.
JHN.6.15	Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone. 
JHN.6.16	And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea; 
JHN.6.17	and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
JHN.6.18	And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. 
JHN.6.19	When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid. 
JHN.6.20	But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. 
JHN.6.21	They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.
JHN.6.22	On the morrow the multitude which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but 
JHN.6.23	(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks): 
JHN.6.24	when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 
JHN.6.25	And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled. 
JHN.6.27	Work not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, 
JHN.6.28	They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God? 
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 
JHN.6.30	They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou? 
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. 
JHN.6.32	Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. 
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world. 
JHN.6.34	They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 
JHN.6.35	Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 
JHN.6.36	But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not. 
JHN.6.37	All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 
JHN.6.38	For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
JHN.6.39	And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. 
JHN.6.40	For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. 
JHN.6.41	The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. 
JHN.6.42	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven? 
JHN.6.43	Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
JHN.6.44	No man can come to me, except the Father which sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day. 
JHN.6.45	It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. 
JHN.6.46	Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is from God, he hath seen the Father. 
JHN.6.47	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life. 
JHN.6.48	I am the bread of life. 
JHN.6.49	Your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 
JHN.6.50	This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 
JHN.6.51	I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world. 
JHN.6.52	The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 
JHN.6.53	Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves. 
JHN.6.54	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. 
JHN.6.55	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
JHN.6.56	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. 
JHN.6.57	As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. 
JHN.6.58	This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers did eat, and died: he that eateth this bread shall live for ever. 
JHN.6.59	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard 
JHN.6.61	But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble? 
JHN.6.62	 then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before? 
JHN.6.63	It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life. 
JHN.6.64	But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him. 
JHN.6.65	And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father. 
JHN.6.66	Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 
JHN.6.67	Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away? 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God. 
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? 
JHN.6.71	Now he spake of Judas 
JHN.7.1	And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
JHN.7.2	Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand. 
JHN.7.3	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest. 
JHN.7.4	For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. 
JHN.7.5	For even his brethren did not believe on him. 
JHN.7.6	Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is alway ready. 
JHN.7.7	The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. 
JHN.7.8	Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled. 
JHN.7.9	And having said these things unto them, he abode 
JHN.7.10	But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. 
JHN.7.11	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
JHN.7.12	And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray. 
JHN.7.13	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
JHN.7.15	The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 
JHN.7.16	Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. 
JHN.7.17	If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it be of God, or 
JHN.7.18	He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 
JHN.7.19	Did not Moses give you the law, and 
JHN.7.20	The multitude answered, Thou hast a devil: who seeketh to kill thee? 
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel. 
JHN.7.22	For this cause hath Moses given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man. 
JHN.7.23	If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath? 
JHN.7.24	Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgement. 
JHN.7.25	Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? 
JHN.7.26	And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ? 
JHN.7.27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. 
JHN.7.28	Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
JHN.7.29	I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me. 
JHN.7.30	They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? 
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him. 
JHN.7.33	Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me. 
JHN.7.34	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come. 
JHN.7.35	The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
JHN.7.36	What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come?
JHN.7.37	Now on the last day, the great 
JHN.7.38	He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 
JHN.7.39	But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet 
JHN.7.40	 of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet. 
JHN.7.41	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? 
JHN.7.43	So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. 
JHN.7.44	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
JHN.7.45	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him? 
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, Never man so spake. 
JHN.7.47	The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray? 
JHN.7.48	Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? 
JHN.7.49	But this multitude which knoweth not the law are accursed. 
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them), 
JHN.7.51	Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth? 
JHN.7.52	They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. 
JHN.8.12	Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true. 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. 
JHN.8.15	Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
JHN.8.16	Yea and if I judge, my judgement is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 
JHN.8.17	Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true. 
JHN.8.18	I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. 
JHN.8.19	They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also. 
JHN.8.20	These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
JHN.8.21	He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come. 
JHN.8.22	The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come? 
JHN.8.23	And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 
JHN.8.24	I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am 
JHN.8.25	They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning. 
JHN.8.26	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world. 
JHN.8.27	They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father. 
JHN.8.28	Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am 
JHN.8.29	And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him. 
JHN.8.30	As he spake these things, many believed on him.
JHN.8.31	Jesus therefore said to those Jews which had believed him, If ye abide in my word, 
JHN.8.32	and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 
JHN.8.33	They answered unto him, We be Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin. 
JHN.8.35	And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever. 
JHN.8.36	If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. 
JHN.8.37	I know that ye are Abraham's seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.
JHN.8.38	I speak the things which I have seen with 
JHN.8.39	They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
JHN.8.40	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham. 
JHN.8.41	Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, 
JHN.8.42	Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. 
JHN.8.43	Why do ye not understand my speech? 
JHN.8.44	Ye are of 
JHN.8.45	But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
JHN.8.46	Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me? 
JHN.8.47	He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear 
JHN.8.48	The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. 
JHN.8.50	But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
JHN.8.51	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. 
JHN.8.52	The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death. 
JHN.8.53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God; 
JHN.8.55	and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word. 
JHN.8.56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. 
JHN.8.57	The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
JHN.8.58	Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
JHN.8.59	They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
JHN.9.1	And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 
JHN.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? 
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
JHN.9.4	We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 
JHN.9.5	When I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
JHN.9.6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, 
JHN.9.7	and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
JHN.9.8	The neighbours therefore, and they which saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 
JHN.9.9	Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am 
JHN.9.10	They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? 
JHN.9.11	He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. 
JHN.9.12	And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.
JHN.9.13	They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
JHN.9.14	Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
JHN.9.15	Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 
JHN.9.16	Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. 
JHN.9.17	They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. 
JHN.9.18	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, 
JHN.9.19	and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? 
JHN.9.20	His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
JHN.9.21	but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. 
JHN.9.22	These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him 
JHN.9.23	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. 
JHN.9.24	So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. 
JHN.9.25	He therefore answered, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
JHN.9.26	They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 
JHN.9.27	He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? 
JHN.9.28	And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. 
JHN.9.29	We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. 
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and 
JHN.9.31	We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. 
JHN.9.32	Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. 
JHN.9.34	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? 
JHN.9.37	Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. 
JHN.9.38	And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, For judgement came I into this world, that they which see not may see; and that they which see may become blind. 
JHN.9.40	Those of the Pharisees which were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? 
JHN.9.41	Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.
JHN.10.1	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
JHN.10.2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
JHN.10.3	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 
JHN.10.4	When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 
JHN.10.5	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. 
JHN.10.6	This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 
JHN.10.7	Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
JHN.10.8	All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 
JHN.10.9	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture. 
JHN.10.10	The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have 
JHN.10.11	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.12	He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth 
JHN.10.13	 because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 
JHN.10.14	I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me, 
JHN.10.15	even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.16	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd. 
JHN.10.17	Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. 
JHN.10.18	No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.
JHN.10.19	There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words. 
JHN.10.20	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 
JHN.10.21	Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
JHN.10.22	And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: it was winter; 
JHN.10.23	and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
JHN.10.24	The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly. 
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me. 
JHN.10.26	But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. 
JHN.10.27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 
JHN.10.28	and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 
JHN.10.29	My Father, which hath given 
JHN.10.30	I and the Father are one. 
JHN.10.31	The Jews took up stones again to stone him. 
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 
JHN.10.35	If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken), 
JHN.10.36	say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am 
JHN.10.37	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
JHN.10.38	But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
JHN.10.39	They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand. 
JHN.10.40	And he went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode. 
JHN.10.41	And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true. 
JHN.10.42	And many believed on him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
JHN.11.2	And it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
JHN.11.3	The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 
JHN.11.4	But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby. 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was. 
JHN.11.7	Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 
JHN.11.8	The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 
JHN.11.10	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him. 
JHN.11.11	These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 
JHN.11.12	The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover. 
JHN.11.13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep. 
JHN.11.14	Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
JHN.11.15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. 
JHN.11.16	Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
JHN.11.17	So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. 
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; 
JHN.11.19	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. 
JHN.11.20	Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house. 
JHN.11.21	Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
JHN.11.22	And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. 
JHN.11.23	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 
JHN.11.24	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live: 
JHN.11.26	and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this? 
JHN.11.27	She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, 
JHN.11.28	And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is here, and calleth thee. 
JHN.11.29	And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him. 
JHN.11.30	(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.) 
JHN.11.31	The Jews then which were with her in the house, and were comforting her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there. 
JHN.11.32	Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
JHN.11.33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews 
JHN.11.34	and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him! 
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die? 
JHN.11.38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been 
JHN.11.40	Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 
JHN.11.41	So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. 
JHN.11.42	And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me. 
JHN.11.43	And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 
JHN.11.44	He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
JHN.11.45	Many therefore of the Jews, which came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs. 
JHN.11.48	If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. 
JHN.11.49	But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 
JHN.11.50	nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
JHN.11.51	Now this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation; 
JHN.11.52	and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad. 
JHN.11.53	So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death. 
JHN.11.54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples. 
JHN.11.55	Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves. 
JHN.11.56	They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast? 
JHN.11.57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should shew it, that they might take him.
JHN.12.1	Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him. 
JHN.12.3	Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
JHN.12.4	But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, which should betray him, saith, 
JHN.12.5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
JHN.12.6	Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein. 
JHN.12.7	Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying. 
JHN.12.8	For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always. 
JHN.12.9	The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
JHN.12.11	because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
JHN.12.12	On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
JHN.12.13	took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed 
JHN.12.14	And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
JHN.12.15	Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. 
JHN.12.16	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
JHN.12.17	The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness. 
JHN.12.18	For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. 
JHN.12.19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.
JHN.12.20	Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast: 
JHN.12.21	these therefore came to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
JHN.12.22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus. 
JHN.12.23	And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
JHN.12.24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. 
JHN.12.25	He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 
JHN.12.26	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour.
JHN.12.27	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. 
JHN.12.28	Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, 
JHN.12.29	The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him. 
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes. 
JHN.12.31	Now is the judgement of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
JHN.12.32	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself. 
JHN.12.33	But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die. 
JHN.12.34	The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 
JHN.12.35	Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
JHN.12.36	While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.
JHN.12.37	But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him: 
JHN.12.38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
JHN.12.39	For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again, 
JHN.12.40	He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them. 
JHN.12.41	These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
JHN.12.44	And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 
JHN.12.45	And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me. 
JHN.12.46	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness. 
JHN.12.47	And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
JHN.12.48	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day. 
JHN.12.49	For I spake not from myself; but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 
JHN.12.50	And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.
JHN.13.1	Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
JHN.13.2	And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's 
JHN.13.3	, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God, 
JHN.13.4	riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself. 
JHN.13.5	Then he poureth water into the bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
JHN.13.6	So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter. 
JHN.13.8	Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
JHN.13.10	Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 
JHN.13.11	For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. 
JHN.13.12	So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 
JHN.13.13	Ye call me, Master, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 
JHN.13.14	If I then, the Lord and the Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. 
JHN.13.15	For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you. 
JHN.13.16	Verily, verily, I say unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him. 
JHN.13.17	If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.
JHN.13.18	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me. 
JHN.13.19	From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am 
JHN.13.20	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
JHN.13.21	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
JHN.13.22	The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 
JHN.13.23	There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell 
JHN.13.25	He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
JHN.13.26	Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, 
JHN.13.27	And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
JHN.13.28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
JHN.13.29	For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
JHN.13.30	He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.
JHN.13.31	When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him; 
JHN.13.32	and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him. 
JHN.13.33	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you. 
JHN.13.34	A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
JHN.13.35	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow afterwards. 
JHN.13.37	Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee. 
JHN.13.38	Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
JHN.14.1	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 
JHN.14.2	In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. 
JHN.14.3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, 
JHN.14.4	And whither I go, ye know the way. 
JHN.14.5	Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way? 
JHN.14.6	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
JHN.14.7	If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 
JHN.14.8	Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
JHN.14.9	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Shew us the Father? 
JHN.14.10	Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works. 
JHN.14.11	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
JHN.14.12	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater 
JHN.14.13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
JHN.14.14	If ye shall ask me anything in my name, that will I do.
JHN.14.15	If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments. 
JHN.14.16	And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, 
JHN.14.17	 the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.
JHN.14.18	I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you. 
JHN.14.19	Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also. 
JHN.14.20	In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 
JHN.14.21	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him. 
JHN.14.22	Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 
JHN.14.24	He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
JHN.14.25	These things have I spoken unto you, while 
JHN.14.26	But the Comforter, 
JHN.14.27	Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
JHN.14.28	Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I. 
JHN.14.29	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe. 
JHN.14.30	I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me; 
JHN.14.31	but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
JHN.15.1	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
JHN.15.2	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every 
JHN.15.3	Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you. 
JHN.15.4	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. 
JHN.15.5	I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing. 
JHN.15.6	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. 
JHN.15.7	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. 
JHN.15.8	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and 
JHN.15.9	Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love. 
JHN.15.10	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. 
JHN.15.11	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and 
JHN.15.12	This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you. 
JHN.15.13	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 
JHN.15.14	Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you. 
JHN.15.15	No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known unto you. 
JHN.15.16	Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and 
JHN.15.17	These things I command you, that ye may love one another.
JHN.15.18	If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before 
JHN.15.19	If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 
JHN.15.20	Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. 
JHN.15.21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. 
JHN.15.22	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin. 
JHN.15.23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 
JHN.15.24	If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. 
JHN.15.25	But 
JHN.15.26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, 
JHN.15.27	and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
JHN.16.1	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be made to stumble. 
JHN.16.2	They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God. 
JHN.16.3	And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 
JHN.16.4	But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you. 
JHN.16.5	But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
JHN.16.6	But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
JHN.16.7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. 
JHN.16.8	And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement: 
JHN.16.9	of sin, because they believe not on me; 
JHN.16.10	of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more; 
JHN.16.11	of judgement, because the prince of this world hath been judged. 
JHN.16.12	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 
JHN.16.13	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, 
JHN.16.14	He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare 
JHN.16.15	All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare 
JHN.16.16	A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me. 
JHN.16.17	 of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 
JHN.16.18	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith. 
JHN.16.19	Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me? 
JHN.16.20	Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. 
JHN.16.21	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world. 
JHN.16.22	And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.
JHN.16.23	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name. 
JHN.16.24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled. 
JHN.16.25	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but shall tell you plainly of the Father. 
JHN.16.26	In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you; 
JHN.16.27	for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
JHN.16.28	I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father. 
JHN.16.29	His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
JHN.16.30	Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
JHN.16.32	Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and 
JHN.16.33	These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
JHN.17.1	These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee: 
JHN.17.2	even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that whatsoever thou hast given him, to them he should give eternal life. 
JHN.17.3	And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, 
JHN.17.4	I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do. 
JHN.17.5	And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
JHN.17.6	I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word. 
JHN.17.7	Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee: 
JHN.17.8	for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received 
JHN.17.9	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine: 
JHN.17.10	and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.
JHN.17.11	And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we 
JHN.17.12	While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. 
JHN.17.13	But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 
JHN.17.14	I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.15	I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil 
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JHN.17.17	Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth. 
JHN.17.18	As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world. 
JHN.17.19	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
JHN.17.20	Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word; 
JHN.17.21	that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, 
JHN.17.22	And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we 
JHN.17.23	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.
JHN.17.24	Father, that which thou hast given me, I will that, where I am, they also may be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. 
JHN.17.25	O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me; 
JHN.17.26	and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, himself and his disciples. 
JHN.18.2	Now Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples. 
JHN.18.3	Judas then, having received the band 
JHN.18.4	Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? 
JHN.18.5	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am 
JHN.18.6	When therefore he said unto them, I am 
JHN.18.7	Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, I told you that I am 
JHN.18.9	that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one. 
JHN.18.10	Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus. 
JHN.18.11	Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? 
JHN.18.12	So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
JHN.18.13	and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was high priest that year. 
JHN.18.14	Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
JHN.18.15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and 
JHN.18.16	but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. 
JHN.18.17	The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also 
JHN.18.18	Now the servants and the officers were standing 
JHN.18.19	The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing. 
JHN.18.21	Why askest thou me? ask them that have heard 
JHN.18.22	And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? 
JHN.18.24	Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also 
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
JHN.18.27	Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.
JHN.18.28	They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the palace: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the palace, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. 
JHN.18.29	Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man? 
JHN.18.30	They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee. 
JHN.18.31	Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
JHN.18.32	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die. 
JHN.18.33	Pilate therefore entered again into the palace, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me? 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? 
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
JHN.18.37	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 
JHN.18.38	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him. 
JHN.18.39	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
JHN.18.40	They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment; 
JHN.19.3	and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands. 
JHN.19.4	And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him. 
JHN.19.5	Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And 
JHN.19.6	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify 
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
JHN.19.8	When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; 
JHN.19.9	and he entered into the palace again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
JHN.19.10	Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? 
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. 
JHN.19.12	Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 
JHN.19.13	When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgement-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
JHN.19.14	Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King! 
JHN.19.15	They therefore cried out, Away with 
JHN.19.16	Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified. 
JHN.19.17	They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: 
JHN.19.18	where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
JHN.19.19	And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
JHN.19.20	This title therefore read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, 
JHN.19.21	The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. 
JHN.19.23	The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
JHN.19.24	They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. 
JHN.19.25	But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the 
JHN.19.26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son! 
JHN.19.27	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own 
JHN.19.28	After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst. 
JHN.19.29	There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. 
JHN.19.30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
JHN.19.31	The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high 
JHN.19.32	The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him: 
JHN.19.33	but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
JHN.19.34	howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water. 
JHN.19.35	And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe. 
JHN.19.36	For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. 
JHN.19.37	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
JHN.19.38	And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave 
JHN.19.39	And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds 
JHN.19.40	So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid. 
JHN.19.42	There then because of the Jews' Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.
JHN.20.1	Now on the first 
JHN.20.2	She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. 
JHN.20.3	Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb; 
JHN.20.5	and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in. 
JHN.20.6	Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying, 
JHN.20.7	and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. 
JHN.20.8	Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, which came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. 
JHN.20.9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	So the disciples went away again unto their own home.
JHN.20.11	But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; 
JHN.20.12	and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
JHN.20.13	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 
JHN.20.14	When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
JHN.20.15	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
JHN.20.16	Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 
JHN.20.17	Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God. 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and 
JHN.20.19	When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first 
JHN.20.20	And when he had said this, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. 
JHN.20.21	Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace 
JHN.20.22	And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 
JHN.20.23	whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever 
JHN.20.24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
JHN.20.25	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
JHN.20.26	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace 
JHN.20.27	Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach 
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 
JHN.20.29	Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed 
JHN.20.30	Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book: 
JHN.20.31	but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.
JHN.21.1	After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested 
JHN.21.2	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing. 
JHN.21.4	But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: howbeit the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
JHN.21.5	Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No. 
JHN.21.6	And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 
JHN.21.7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea. 
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net 
JHN.21.9	So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
JHN.21.10	Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken. 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent. 
JHN.21.12	Jesus saith unto them, Come 
JHN.21.13	Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. 
JHN.21.14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
JHN.21.15	So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, 
JHN.21.16	He saith to him again a second time, Simon, 
JHN.21.17	He saith unto him the third time, Simon, 
JHN.21.18	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. 
JHN.21.19	Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
JHN.21.20	Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? 
JHN.21.21	Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 
JHN.21.22	Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what 
JHN.21.23	This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple which beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true. 
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.
ACT.1.1	The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, 
ACT.1.2	until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Ghost unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 
ACT.1.3	To whom he also shewed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God: 
ACT.1.4	and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, 
ACT.1.5	For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
ACT.1.6	They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? 
ACT.1.7	And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority. 
ACT.1.8	But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. 
ACT.1.9	And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 
ACT.1.11	which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, which was received up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.
ACT.1.12	Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey off. 
ACT.1.13	And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James 
ACT.1.14	These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
ACT.1.15	And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons 
ACT.1.16	Brethren, it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus. 
ACT.1.17	For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry. 
ACT.1.18	(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. 
ACT.1.19	And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.) 
ACT.1.20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be made desolate, And let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take. 
ACT.1.21	Of the men therefore which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us, 
ACT.1.22	beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection. 
ACT.1.23	And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew of these two the one whom thou hast chosen, 
ACT.1.25	to take the place in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place. 
ACT.1.26	And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place. 
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. 
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
ACT.2.5	Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	And they were all amazed and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? 
ACT.2.8	And how hear we, every man in our own language, wherein we were born? 
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, 
ACT.2.10	in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabians, we do hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God. 
ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this? 
ACT.2.13	But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, 
ACT.2.15	For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is 
ACT.2.16	but this is that which hath been spoken by the prophet Joel; 
ACT.2.17	And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your young men shall see visions, And your old men shall dream dreams: 
ACT.2.18	Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. 
ACT.2.19	And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, And signs on the earth beneath; Blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 
ACT.2.20	The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come, That great and notable 
ACT.2.21	And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
ACT.2.22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know; 
ACT.2.23	him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay: 
ACT.2.24	whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 
ACT.2.25	For David saith concerning him, I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: 
ACT.2.26	Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope: 
ACT.2.27	Because thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption. 
ACT.2.28	Thou madest known unto me the ways of life; Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance. 
ACT.2.29	Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day. 
ACT.2.30	Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set 
ACT.2.31	he foreseeing 
ACT.2.32	This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses. 
ACT.2.33	Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear. 
ACT.2.34	For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
ACT.2.35	Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. 
ACT.2.36	Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard 
ACT.2.38	And Peter 
ACT.2.39	For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, 
ACT.2.40	And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. 
ACT.2.41	They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added 
ACT.2.42	And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. 
ACT.2.43	And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 
ACT.2.45	and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need. 
ACT.2.46	And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they did take their food with gladness and singleness of heart, 
ACT.2.47	praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were being saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, 
ACT.3.2	And a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
ACT.3.3	who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms. 
ACT.3.4	And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us. 
ACT.3.5	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. 
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength. 
ACT.3.8	And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 
ACT.3.10	and they took knowledge of him, that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. 
ACT.3.11	And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
ACT.3.12	And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk? 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him. 
ACT.3.14	But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you, 
ACT.3.15	and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. 
ACT.3.16	And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
ACT.3.17	And now, brethren, I wot that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. 
ACT.3.18	But the things which God foreshewed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. 
ACT.3.19	Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord; 
ACT.3.20	and that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, 
ACT.3.21	whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began. 
ACT.3.22	Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me; to him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you. 
ACT.3.23	And it shall be, that every soul, which shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people. 
ACT.3.24	Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days. 
ACT.3.25	Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 
ACT.3.26	Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
ACT.4.1	And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, 
ACT.4.2	being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide. 
ACT.4.4	But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; 
ACT.4.6	and Annas the high priest 
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders, 
ACT.4.9	if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole; 
ACT.4.10	be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, 
ACT.4.11	He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner. 
ACT.4.12	And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved. 
ACT.4.13	Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	And seeing the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
ACT.4.16	saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. 
ACT.4.17	But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 
ACT.4.18	And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: 
ACT.4.20	for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard. 
ACT.4.21	And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. 
ACT.4.22	For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.
ACT.4.23	And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them. 
ACT.4.24	And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: 
ACT.4.25	who by the Holy Ghost, 
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed: 
ACT.4.27	for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, 
ACT.4.28	to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel foreordained to come to pass. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, 
ACT.4.30	while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus. 
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
ACT.4.32	And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one 
ACT.4.33	And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 
ACT.4.34	For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 
ACT.4.35	and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need. 
ACT.4.36	And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, 
ACT.4.37	having a field, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
ACT.5.1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, 
ACT.5.2	and kept back 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back 
ACT.5.4	Whiles it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. 
ACT.5.5	And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it. 
ACT.5.6	And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him. 
ACT.5.7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. 
ACT.5.8	And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much. 
ACT.5.9	But Peter 
ACT.5.10	And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband. 
ACT.5.11	And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.
ACT.5.12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 
ACT.5.13	But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them; 
ACT.5.14	and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women; 
ACT.5.15	insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them. 
ACT.5.16	And there also came together the multitude from the cities round about Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
ACT.5.17	But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy, 
ACT.5.18	and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward. 
ACT.5.19	But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said, 
ACT.5.20	Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life. 
ACT.5.21	And when they heard 
ACT.5.22	But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told, 
ACT.5.23	saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. 
ACT.5.24	Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow. 
ACT.5.25	And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.
ACT.5.26	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them, 
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, 
ACT.5.28	saying, We straitly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. 
ACT.5.29	But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men. 
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree. 
ACT.5.31	Him did God exalt with his right hand 
ACT.5.32	And we are witnesses of these things; and 
ACT.5.33	But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were minded to slay them. 
ACT.5.34	But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honour of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while. 
ACT.5.35	And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do. 
ACT.5.36	For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought. 
ACT.5.37	After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrollment, and drew away 
ACT.5.38	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown: 
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God. 
ACT.5.40	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
ACT.5.41	They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name. 
ACT.5.42	And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus 
ACT.6.1	Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
ACT.6.2	And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables. 
ACT.6.3	Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 
ACT.6.4	But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word. 
ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 
ACT.6.6	whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 
ACT.6.7	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called 
ACT.6.10	And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake. 
ACT.6.11	Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and 
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council, 
ACT.6.13	and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law: 
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us. 
ACT.6.15	And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	And the high priest said, Are these things so? 
ACT.7.2	And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 
ACT.7.3	and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. 
ACT.7.4	Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, 
ACT.7.5	and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when 
ACT.7.6	And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil, four hundred years. 
ACT.7.7	And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. 
ACT.7.8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so 
ACT.7.9	And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him, 
ACT.7.10	and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. 
ACT.7.11	Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. 
ACT.7.13	And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's race became manifest unto Pharaoh. 
ACT.7.14	And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. 
ACT.7.15	And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself, and our fathers; 
ACT.7.16	and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
ACT.7.17	But as the time of the promise drew nigh, which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
ACT.7.18	till there arose another king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 
ACT.7.19	The same dealt subtilly with our race, and evil entreated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live. 
ACT.7.20	At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father's house: 
ACT.7.21	and when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. 
ACT.7.22	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works. 
ACT.7.23	But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. 
ACT.7.24	And seeing one 
ACT.7.25	and he supposed that his brethren understood how that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not. 
ACT.7.26	And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
ACT.7.27	But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
ACT.7.28	Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday? 
ACT.7.29	And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
ACT.7.30	And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. 
ACT.7.31	And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord, 
ACT.7.32	I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold. 
ACT.7.33	And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	I have surely seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt. 
ACT.7.35	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent 
ACT.7.36	This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 
ACT.7.37	This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me. 
ACT.7.38	This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us: 
ACT.7.39	to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt, 
ACT.7.40	saying unto Aaron, Make us gods which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, which led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
ACT.7.41	And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
ACT.7.42	But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 
ACT.7.43	And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of the god Rephan, The figures which ye made to worship them: And I will carry you away beyond Babylon. 
ACT.7.44	Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen. 
ACT.7.45	Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, which God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; 
ACT.7.46	who found favour in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. 
ACT.7.47	But Solomon built him a house. 
ACT.7.48	Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in 
ACT.7.49	The heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool of my feet: What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord: Or what is the place of my rest? 
ACT.7.50	Did not my hand make all these things?
ACT.7.51	Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. 
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them which shewed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers; 
ACT.7.53	ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.
ACT.7.54	Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. 
ACT.7.55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 
ACT.7.56	and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. 
ACT.7.57	But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; 
ACT.7.58	and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. 
ACT.7.59	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon 
ACT.7.60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
ACT.8.2	And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.
ACT.8.4	They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word. 
ACT.8.5	And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ. 
ACT.8.6	And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. 
ACT.8.7	For 
ACT.8.8	And there was much joy in that city. 
ACT.8.9	But there was a certain man, Simon by name, which beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 
ACT.8.10	to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great. 
ACT.8.11	And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
ACT.8.13	And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 
ACT.8.15	who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
ACT.8.16	for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.8.17	Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.8.18	Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.8.20	But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money. 
ACT.8.21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God. 
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. 
ACT.8.23	For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. 
ACT.8.24	And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
ACT.8.25	They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert. 
ACT.8.27	And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem for to worship; 
ACT.8.28	and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
ACT.8.29	And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
ACT.8.30	And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 
ACT.8.31	And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	Now the place of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth: 
ACT.8.33	In his humiliation his judgement was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth. 
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other? 
ACT.8.35	And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus. 
ACT.8.36	And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, 
ACT.8.38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
ACT.9.2	and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven: 
ACT.9.4	and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
ACT.9.5	And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he 
ACT.9.6	but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. 
ACT.9.7	And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man. 
ACT.9.8	And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.
ACT.9.10	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord 
ACT.9.12	and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. 
ACT.9.13	But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
ACT.9.14	and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: 
ACT.9.16	for I will shew him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake. 
ACT.9.17	And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, 
ACT.9.18	And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized; 
ACT.9.19	and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. 
ACT.9.20	And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God. 
ACT.9.21	And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havock of them which called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests. 
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
ACT.9.23	And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him: 
ACT.9.24	but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him: 
ACT.9.25	but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
ACT.9.26	And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.9.28	And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem, 
ACT.9.29	preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they went about to kill him. 
ACT.9.30	And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
ACT.9.31	So the church throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, was multiplied.
ACT.9.32	And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	And there he found a certain man named Æneas, which had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied. 
ACT.9.34	And Peter said unto him, Æneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And straightway he arose. 
ACT.9.35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. 
ACT.9.37	And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. 
ACT.9.38	And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us. 
ACT.9.39	And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 
ACT.9.40	But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. 
ACT.9.42	And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
ACT.10.1	Now 
ACT.10.2	a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. 
ACT.10.3	He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius. 
ACT.10.4	And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God. 
ACT.10.5	And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter: 
ACT.10.6	he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. 
ACT.10.7	And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; 
ACT.10.8	and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour: 
ACT.10.10	and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance; 
ACT.10.11	and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth: 
ACT.10.12	wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and fowls of the heaven. 
ACT.10.13	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. 
ACT.10.15	And a voice 
ACT.10.16	And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven. 
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate, 
ACT.10.18	and called and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.
ACT.10.19	And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. 
ACT.10.20	But arise, and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them. 
ACT.10.21	And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? 
ACT.10.22	And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned 
ACT.10.23	So he called them in and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. 
ACT.10.24	And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends. 
ACT.10.25	And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. 
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together: 
ACT.10.28	and he said unto them, Ye yourselves know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come unto one of another nation; and 
ACT.10.29	wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me. 
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel, 
ACT.10.31	and saith, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. 
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side. 
ACT.10.33	Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the Lord.
ACT.10.34	And Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: 
ACT.10.35	but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him. 
ACT.10.36	The word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)-- 
ACT.10.37	that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; 
ACT.10.38	 Jesus of Nazareth, how that God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree. 
ACT.10.40	Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest, 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, 
ACT.10.42	And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he which is ordained of God 
ACT.10.43	To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.
ACT.10.44	While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. 
ACT.10.45	And they of the circumcision which believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, 
ACT.10.47	Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? 
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
ACT.11.1	Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, 
ACT.11.3	saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. 
ACT.11.4	But Peter began, and expounded 
ACT.11.5	I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me: 
ACT.11.6	upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the heaven. 
ACT.11.7	And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. 
ACT.11.8	But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth. 
ACT.11.9	But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common. 
ACT.11.10	And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me. 
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man's house: 
ACT.11.13	and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter; 
ACT.11.14	who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house. 
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	And I remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.11.17	If then God gave unto them the like gift as 
ACT.11.18	And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.
ACT.11.19	They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews. 
ACT.11.20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord. 
ACT.11.22	And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch: 
ACT.11.23	who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord: 
ACT.11.24	for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 
ACT.11.25	And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul: 
ACT.11.26	and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught much people; and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
ACT.11.27	Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius. 
ACT.11.29	And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea: 
ACT.11.30	which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. 
ACT.12.2	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 
ACT.12.3	And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And 
ACT.12.4	And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
ACT.12.5	Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him. 
ACT.12.6	And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison. 
ACT.12.7	And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. 
ACT.12.8	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. 
ACT.12.9	And he went out, and followed; and he wist not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision. 
ACT.12.10	And when they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him. 
ACT.12.11	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. 
ACT.12.12	And when he had considered 
ACT.12.13	And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda. 
ACT.12.14	And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate. 
ACT.12.15	And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel. 
ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed. 
ACT.12.17	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place. 
ACT.12.18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.
ACT.12.20	Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king's country. 
ACT.12.21	And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them. 
ACT.12.22	And the people shouted, 
ACT.12.23	And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. 
ACT.12.24	But the word of God grew and multiplied. 
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.
ACT.13.1	Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was 
ACT.13.2	And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. 
ACT.13.3	Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
ACT.13.4	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant. 
ACT.13.6	And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus; 
ACT.13.7	which was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	But Saul, who is also 
ACT.13.10	and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
ACT.13.11	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. 
ACT.13.13	Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
ACT.13.14	But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. 
ACT.13.16	And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken. 
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it. 
ACT.13.18	And for about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. 
ACT.13.19	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave 
ACT.13.20	and after these things he gave 
ACT.13.21	And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years. 
ACT.13.22	And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will. 
ACT.13.23	Of this man's seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus; 
ACT.13.24	when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not 
ACT.13.26	Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth. 
ACT.13.27	For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled 
ACT.13.28	And though they found no cause of death 
ACT.13.29	And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead: 
ACT.13.31	and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers, 
ACT.13.33	how that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. 
ACT.13.34	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure 
ACT.13.35	Because he saith also in another 
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: 
ACT.13.37	but he whom God raised up saw no corruption. 
ACT.13.38	Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: 
ACT.13.39	and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
ACT.13.40	Beware therefore, lest that come upon 
ACT.13.41	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your days, A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.
ACT.13.42	And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. 
ACT.13.44	And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed. 
ACT.13.46	And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	For so hath the Lord commanded us, 
ACT.13.48	And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. 
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews urged on the devout women of honourable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders. 
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.
ACT.14.1	And it came to pass in Iconium, that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. 
ACT.14.2	But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren. 
ACT.14.3	Long time therefore they tarried 
ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
ACT.14.5	And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to entreat them shamefully, and to stone them, 
ACT.14.6	they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about: 
ACT.14.7	and there they preached the gospel.
ACT.14.8	And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked. 
ACT.14.9	The same heard Paul speaking: who, fastening his eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, 
ACT.14.10	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. 
ACT.14.11	And when the multitudes saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. 
ACT.14.12	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. 
ACT.14.13	And the priest of Jupiter whose 
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out 
ACT.14.15	and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: 
ACT.14.16	who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways. 
ACT.14.17	And yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. 
ACT.14.18	And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.
ACT.14.19	But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. 
ACT.14.20	But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch, 
ACT.14.22	confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. 
ACT.14.23	And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed. 
ACT.14.24	And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; 
ACT.14.26	and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. 
ACT.14.27	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and how that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
ACT.14.28	And they tarried no little time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	And certain men came down from Judaea and taught the brethren, 
ACT.15.2	And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, 
ACT.15.3	They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 
ACT.15.4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them. 
ACT.15.5	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.
ACT.15.6	And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter. 
ACT.15.7	And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 
ACT.15.8	And God, which knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; 
ACT.15.9	and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. 
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why tempt ye God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 
ACT.15.11	But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they. 
ACT.15.12	And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 
ACT.15.13	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me: 
ACT.15.14	Symeon hath rehearsed how first God did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
ACT.15.15	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, 
ACT.15.16	After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up: 
ACT.15.17	That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, 
ACT.15.18	Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from the beginning of the world. 
ACT.15.19	Wherefore my judgement is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles turn to God; 
ACT.15.20	but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood. 
ACT.15.21	For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.
ACT.15.22	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; 
ACT.15.23	and they wrote 
ACT.15.24	Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment; 
ACT.15.25	it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
ACT.15.26	men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. 
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 
ACT.15.29	that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well. 
ACT.15.30	So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle. 
ACT.15.31	And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation. 
ACT.15.32	And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. 
ACT.15.33	And after they had spent some time 
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
ACT.15.36	And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, 
ACT.15.37	And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
ACT.15.39	And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus; 
ACT.15.40	but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. 
ACT.15.41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
ACT.16.1	And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess which believed; but his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.2	The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
ACT.16.6	And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Ghost to speak the word in Asia; 
ACT.16.7	and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not; 
ACT.16.8	and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. 
ACT.16.10	And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. 
ACT.16.11	Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; 
ACT.16.12	and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a 
ACT.16.13	And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which were come together. 
ACT.16.14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul. 
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide 
ACT.16.16	And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. 
ACT.16.17	The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, which proclaim unto you the way of salvation. 
ACT.16.18	And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. 
ACT.16.19	But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers, 
ACT.16.20	and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 
ACT.16.21	and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans. 
ACT.16.22	And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods. 
ACT.16.23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 
ACT.16.24	who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them; 
ACT.16.26	and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every one's bands were loosed. 
ACT.16.27	And the jailor being roused out of sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. 
ACT.16.29	And he called for lights, and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, 
ACT.16.30	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 
ACT.16.31	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. 
ACT.16.32	And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately. 
ACT.16.34	And he brought them up into his house, and set meat before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.
ACT.16.35	But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. 
ACT.16.36	And the jailor reported the words to Paul, 
ACT.16.37	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out. 
ACT.16.38	And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans; 
ACT.16.39	and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city. 
ACT.16.40	And they went out of the prison, and entered into 
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 
ACT.17.2	and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures, 
ACT.17.3	opening and alleging, that it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, 
ACT.17.4	And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. 
ACT.17.5	But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people. 
ACT.17.6	And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; 
ACT.17.7	whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, 
ACT.17.8	And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. 
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
ACT.17.11	Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the scriptures daily, whether these things were so. 
ACT.17.12	Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honourable estate, and of men, not a few. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes. 
ACT.17.14	And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still. 
ACT.17.15	But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him, as he beheld the city full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met with him. 
ACT.17.18	And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection. 
ACT.17.19	And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee? 
ACT.17.20	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. 
ACT.17.21	(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)
ACT.17.22	And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are somewhat superstitious. 
ACT.17.23	For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN 
ACT.17.24	The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
ACT.17.25	neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; 
ACT.17.26	and he made of one every nation of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined 
ACT.17.27	that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he is not far from each one of us: 
ACT.17.28	for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. 
ACT.17.29	Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man. 
ACT.17.30	The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent: 
ACT.17.31	inasmuch as he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
ACT.17.32	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again. 
ACT.17.33	Thus Paul went out from among them. 
ACT.17.34	But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them; 
ACT.18.3	and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought; for by their trade they were tentmakers. 
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. 
ACT.18.5	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. 
ACT.18.6	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood 
ACT.18.7	And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 
ACT.18.8	And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 
ACT.18.9	And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
ACT.18.10	for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city. 
ACT.18.11	And he dwelt 
ACT.18.12	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul, and brought him before the judgement-seat, 
ACT.18.13	saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 
ACT.18.14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
ACT.18.15	but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters. 
ACT.18.16	And he drave them from the judgement-seat. 
ACT.18.17	And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgement-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
ACT.18.18	And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchreae: for he had a vow. 
ACT.18.19	And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not; 
ACT.18.21	but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you, if God will, he set sail from Ephesus. 
ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch. 
ACT.18.23	And having spent some time 
ACT.18.24	Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, a learned man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures. 
ACT.18.25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught carefully the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John: 
ACT.18.26	and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more carefully. 
ACT.18.27	And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much which had believed through grace: 
ACT.18.28	for he powerfully confuted the Jews, 
ACT.19.1	And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples: 
ACT.19.2	and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed? And they 
ACT.19.3	And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. 
ACT.19.4	And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Jesus. 
ACT.19.5	And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. 
ACT.19.7	And they were in all about twelve men.
ACT.19.8	And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading 
ACT.19.9	But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. 
ACT.19.10	And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. 
ACT.19.11	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 
ACT.19.12	insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.
ACT.19.13	But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them which had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 
ACT.19.14	And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, which did this. 
ACT.19.15	And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? 
ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. 
ACT.19.18	Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds. 
ACT.19.19	And not a few of them that practised curious arts brought their books together, and burned them in the sight of all: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
ACT.19.20	So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 
ACT.19.22	And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while. 
ACT.19.23	And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way. 
ACT.19.24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen; 
ACT.19.25	whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth. 
ACT.19.26	And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 
ACT.19.27	and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. 
ACT.19.28	And when they heard this, they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great 
ACT.19.29	And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel. 
ACT.19.30	And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. 
ACT.19.31	And certain also of the chief officers of Asia, being his friends, sent unto him, and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre. 
ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. 
ACT.19.33	And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defence unto the people. 
ACT.19.34	But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great 
ACT.19.35	And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the 
ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash. 
ACT.19.37	For ye have brought 
ACT.19.38	If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another. 
ACT.19.39	But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause 
ACT.19.41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece. 
ACT.20.3	And when he had spent three months 
ACT.20.4	And there accompanied him as far as Asia Sopater of Beroea, 
ACT.20.5	But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we tarried seven days.
ACT.20.7	And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight. 
ACT.20.8	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where we were gathered together. 
ACT.20.9	And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead. 
ACT.20.10	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him. 
ACT.20.11	And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. 
ACT.20.12	And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.
ACT.20.13	But we, going before to the ship, set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land. 
ACT.20.14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time, 
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews: 
ACT.20.20	how that I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house, 
ACT.20.21	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 
ACT.20.23	save that the Holy Ghost testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. 
ACT.20.24	But I hold not my life of any account, as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 
ACT.20.25	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more. 
ACT.20.26	Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. 
ACT.20.27	For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God. 
ACT.20.28	Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in the which the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops, to feed the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood. 
ACT.20.29	I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock; 
ACT.20.30	and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 
ACT.20.31	Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears. 
ACT.20.32	And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build 
ACT.20.33	I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 
ACT.20.34	Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 
ACT.20.35	In all things I gave you an example, how that so labouring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
ACT.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 
ACT.20.38	Sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.
ACT.21.1	And when it came to pass that we were parted from them, and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 
ACT.21.2	and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. 
ACT.21.4	And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way, till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, 
ACT.21.6	and bade each other farewell; and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again. 
ACT.21.7	And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
ACT.21.8	And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him. 
ACT.21.9	Now this man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. 
ACT.21.10	And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. 
ACT.21.11	And coming to us, and taking Paul's girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. 
ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.21.14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
ACT.21.15	And after these days we took up our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	And there went with us also 
ACT.21.17	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
ACT.21.18	And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. 
ACT.21.19	And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 
ACT.21.20	And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them which have believed; and they are all zealous for the law: 
ACT.21.21	and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. 
ACT.21.22	What is it therefore? they will certainly hear that thou art come. 
ACT.21.23	Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; 
ACT.21.24	these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law. 
ACT.21.25	But as touching the Gentiles which have believed, we wrote, giving judgement that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication. 
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
ACT.21.27	And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude, and laid hands on him, 
ACT.21.28	crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place. 
ACT.21.29	For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. 
ACT.21.30	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut. 
ACT.21.31	And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion. 
ACT.21.32	And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle. 
ACT.21.35	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd; 
ACT.21.36	for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him. 
ACT.21.37	And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Art thou not then the Egyptian, which before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins? 
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people. 
ACT.21.40	And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,
ACT.22.1	Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you. 
ACT.22.2	And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,
ACT.22.3	I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day: 
ACT.22.4	and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. 
ACT.22.5	As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus, to bring them also which were there unto Jerusalem in bonds, for to be punished. 
ACT.22.6	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. 
ACT.22.7	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. 
ACT.22.9	And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. 
ACT.22.10	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. 
ACT.22.11	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. 
ACT.22.12	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, 
ACT.22.13	came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him. 
ACT.22.14	And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. 
ACT.22.15	For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name. 
ACT.22.17	And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance, 
ACT.22.18	and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me. 
ACT.22.19	And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: 
ACT.22.20	and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him. 
ACT.22.21	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.
ACT.22.22	And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. 
ACT.22.23	And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air, 
ACT.22.24	the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him. 
ACT.22.25	And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? 
ACT.22.26	And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain, and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman. 
ACT.22.27	And the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea. 
ACT.22.28	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am 
ACT.22.29	They then which were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
ACT.22.30	But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty, wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
ACT.23.1	And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day. 
ACT.23.2	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? 
ACT.23.4	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? 
ACT.23.5	And Paul said, I wist not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.
ACT.23.6	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. 
ACT.23.7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees: and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. 
ACT.23.9	And there arose a great clamour: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel? 
ACT.23.10	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle. 
ACT.23.11	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
ACT.23.12	And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	And they were more than forty which made this conspiracy. 
ACT.23.14	And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to slay him. 
ACT.23.16	But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle, and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath something to tell him. 
ACT.23.18	So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee. 
ACT.23.19	And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is that thou hast to tell me? 
ACT.23.20	And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him. 
ACT.23.21	Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee. 
ACT.23.22	So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me. 
ACT.23.23	And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night: 
ACT.23.24	and 
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter after this form: 
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting. 
ACT.23.27	This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. 
ACT.23.28	And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council: 
ACT.23.29	whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. 
ACT.23.30	And when it was shewn to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee. 
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: 
ACT.23.33	and they, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him. 
ACT.23.34	And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, 
ACT.23.35	I will hear thy cause, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.
ACT.24.1	And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and 
ACT.24.2	And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation, 
ACT.24.3	we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. 
ACT.24.4	But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
ACT.24.6	who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:
ACT.24.8	from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. 
ACT.24.9	And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.
ACT.24.10	And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do cheerfully make my defence: 
ACT.24.11	seeing that thou canst take knowledge, that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: 
ACT.24.12	and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city. 
ACT.24.13	Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me. 
ACT.24.14	But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets: 
ACT.24.15	having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust. 
ACT.24.16	Herein do I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men alway. 
ACT.24.17	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: 
ACT.24.18	amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but 
ACT.24.19	who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found, when I stood before the council, 
ACT.24.21	except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.
ACT.24.22	But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter. 
ACT.24.23	And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him. 
ACT.24.24	But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, which was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	And as he reasoned of righteousness, and temperance, and the judgement to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me. 
ACT.24.26	He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. 
ACT.24.27	But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favour with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
ACT.25.1	Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 
ACT.25.2	And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him, 
ACT.25.3	asking favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying wait to kill him on the way. 
ACT.25.4	Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart 
ACT.25.5	Let them therefore, saith he, which are of power among you, go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him. 
ACT.25.6	And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgement-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. 
ACT.25.7	And when he was come, the Jews which had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges, which they could not prove; 
ACT.25.8	while Paul said in his defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all. 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, desiring to gain favour with the Jews, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? 
ACT.25.10	But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgement-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest. 
ACT.25.11	If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if none of those things is 
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.
ACT.25.13	Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus. 
ACT.25.14	And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix: 
ACT.25.15	about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed 
ACT.25.16	To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid against him. 
ACT.25.17	When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat down on the judgement-seat, and commanded the man to be brought. 
ACT.25.18	Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed; 
ACT.25.19	but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. 
ACT.25.20	And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Caesar. 
ACT.25.22	And Agrippa 
ACT.25.23	So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in. 
ACT.25.24	And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him. 
ACT.25.26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.
ACT.26.1	And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence: 
ACT.26.2	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews: 
ACT.26.3	especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. 
ACT.26.4	My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation, and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
ACT.26.5	having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, how that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
ACT.26.6	And now I stand 
ACT.26.7	unto which 
ACT.26.8	Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead? 
ACT.26.9	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them. 
ACT.26.11	And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.
ACT.26.12	Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, 
ACT.26.13	at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad. 
ACT.26.15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
ACT.26.16	But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee; 
ACT.26.17	delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, 
ACT.26.18	to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me. 
ACT.26.19	Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
ACT.26.20	but declared both to them of Damascus first, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. 
ACT.26.21	For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me. 
ACT.26.22	Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come; 
ACT.26.23	how that the Christ must suffer, 
ACT.26.24	And as he thus made his defence, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning doth turn thee to madness. 
ACT.26.25	But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness. 
ACT.26.26	For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
ACT.26.28	And Agrippa 
ACT.26.29	And Paul 
ACT.26.30	And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
ACT.26.31	and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
ACT.27.1	And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band. 
ACT.27.2	And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. 
ACT.27.3	And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself. 
ACT.27.4	And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, 
ACT.27.6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein. 
ACT.27.7	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone; 
ACT.27.8	and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. 
ACT.27.9	And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them, 
ACT.27.10	and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives. 
ACT.27.11	But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.
ACT.27.12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter 
ACT.27.13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore. 
ACT.27.14	But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo: 
ACT.27.15	and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way 
ACT.27.16	And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat: 
ACT.27.17	and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven. 
ACT.27.18	And as we laboured exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw 
ACT.27.19	and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship. 
ACT.27.20	And when neither sun nor stars shone upon 
ACT.27.21	And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss. 
ACT.27.22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but 
ACT.27.23	For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve, 
ACT.27.24	saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee. 
ACT.27.25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me. 
ACT.27.26	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. 
ACT.27.27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the 
ACT.27.28	and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms: and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms. 
ACT.27.29	And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day. 
ACT.27.30	And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship, 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off. 
ACT.27.33	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing. 
ACT.27.34	Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you. 
ACT.27.35	And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all: and he brake it, and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food. 
ACT.27.37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. 
ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. 
ACT.27.39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it. 
ACT.27.40	And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence 
ACT.27.42	And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any 
ACT.27.43	But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land: 
ACT.27.44	and the rest, some on planks, and some on 
ACT.28.1	And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. 
ACT.28.2	And the barbarians shewed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 
ACT.28.3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 
ACT.28.4	And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live. 
ACT.28.5	Howbeit he shook off the beast into the fire, and took no harm. 
ACT.28.6	But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation, and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. 
ACT.28.7	Now in the neighbourhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius; who received us, and entertained us three days courteously. 
ACT.28.8	And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. 
ACT.28.9	And when this was done, the rest also which had diseases in the island came, and were cured: 
ACT.28.10	who also honoured us with many honours; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.
ACT.28.11	And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers. 
ACT.28.12	And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. 
ACT.28.13	And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli: 
ACT.28.14	where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome. 
ACT.28.15	And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius, and The Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 
ACT.28.16	And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
ACT.28.17	And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: 
ACT.28.18	who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me. 
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of. 
ACT.28.20	For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with 
ACT.28.21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee. 
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.
ACT.28.23	And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded 
ACT.28.24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. 
ACT.28.25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, 
ACT.28.26	saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: 
ACT.28.27	For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them. 
ACT.28.28	Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.
ACT.28.30	And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him, 
ACT.28.31	preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.
ROM.1.1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called 
ROM.1.2	which he promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures, 
ROM.1.3	concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, 
ROM.1.4	who was declared 
ROM.1.5	through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake: 
ROM.1.6	among whom are ye also, called 
ROM.1.7	To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called 
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. 
ROM.1.9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers 
ROM.1.10	making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 
ROM.1.12	that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine. 
ROM.1.13	And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles. 
ROM.1.14	I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 
ROM.1.15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
ROM.1.17	For therein is revealed a righteousness of God by faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith. 
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold down the truth in unrighteousness;
ROM.1.19	because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them. 
ROM.1.20	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, 
ROM.1.21	because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened. 
ROM.1.22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. 
ROM.1.24	Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonoured among themselves: 
ROM.1.25	for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 
ROM.1.26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature: 
ROM.1.27	and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due. 
ROM.1.28	And even as they refused to have God in 
ROM.1.29	being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
ROM.1.30	backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful: 
ROM.1.32	who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they which practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.
ROM.2.1	Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things. 
ROM.2.2	And we know that the judgement of God is according to truth against them that practise such things. 
ROM.2.3	And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God? 
ROM.2.4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 
ROM.2.5	but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgement of God; 
ROM.2.6	who will render to every man according to his works: 
ROM.2.7	to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life: 
ROM.2.8	but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, 
ROM.2.9	tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek; 
ROM.2.10	but glory and honour and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek: 
ROM.2.11	for there is no respect of persons with God. 
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law; 
ROM.2.13	for not the hearers of a law are just before God, but the doers of a law shall be justified: 
ROM.2.14	for when Gentiles which have no law do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law unto themselves; 
ROM.2.15	in that they shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing 
ROM.2.16	in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.
ROM.2.17	But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God, 
ROM.2.18	and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, 
ROM.2.19	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth; 
ROM.2.21	thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 
ROM.2.22	thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples? 
ROM.2.23	thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonourest thou God? 
ROM.2.24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written. 
ROM.2.25	For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision. 
ROM.2.26	If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? 
ROM.2.28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 
ROM.2.29	but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
ROM.3.1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God. 
ROM.3.3	For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God? 
ROM.3.4	God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgement. 
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.) 
ROM.3.6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	and why not (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just. 
ROM.3.9	What then? are we in worse case than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 
ROM.3.10	as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one; 
ROM.3.11	There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God; 
ROM.3.12	They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one: 
ROM.3.13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips: 
ROM.3.14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 
ROM.3.15	Their feet are swift to shed blood; 
ROM.3.16	Destruction and misery are in their ways; 
ROM.3.17	And the way of peace have they not known: 
ROM.3.18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.
ROM.3.19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgement of God: 
ROM.3.20	because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for through the law 
ROM.3.21	But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 
ROM.3.22	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; 
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; 
ROM.3.24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
ROM.3.25	whom God set forth 
ROM.3.26	for the shewing, 
ROM.3.27	Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith. 
ROM.3.28	We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 
ROM.3.29	Or is God 
ROM.3.30	if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. 
ROM.3.31	Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, hath found? 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God. 
ROM.4.3	For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. 
ROM.4.4	Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt. 
ROM.4.5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness. 
ROM.4.6	Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works, 
ROM.4.7	, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered. 
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness. 
ROM.4.10	How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision: 
ROM.4.11	and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them; 
ROM.4.12	and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision. 
ROM.4.13	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith. 
ROM.4.14	For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect: 
ROM.4.15	for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression. 
ROM.4.16	For this cause 
ROM.4.17	(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, 
ROM.4.18	Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be. 
ROM.4.19	And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
ROM.4.20	yea, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God, 
ROM.4.21	and being fully assured that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 
ROM.4.22	Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
ROM.4.23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him; 
ROM.4.24	but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 
ROM.4.25	who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
ROM.5.1	Being therefore justified by faith, let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 
ROM.5.2	through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and let us rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
ROM.5.3	And not only so, but let us also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 
ROM.5.4	and patience, probation; and probation, hope: 
ROM.5.5	and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost which was given unto us.
ROM.5.6	For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
ROM.5.9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath 
ROM.5.10	For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life; 
ROM.5.11	and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. 
ROM.5.12	Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:-- 
ROM.5.13	for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come. 
ROM.5.15	But not as the trespass, so also 
ROM.5.16	And not as through one that sinned, 
ROM.5.17	For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, 
ROM.5.18	So then as through one trespass 
ROM.5.19	For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous. 
ROM.5.20	And the law came in beside, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly: 
ROM.5.21	that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 
ROM.6.2	God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein? 
ROM.6.3	Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. 
ROM.6.5	For if we have become united with 
ROM.6.6	knowing this, that our old man was crucified with 
ROM.6.7	for he that hath died is justified from sin. 
ROM.6.8	But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; 
ROM.6.9	knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him. 
ROM.6.10	For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 
ROM.6.11	Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.6.12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: 
ROM.6.13	neither present your members unto sin 
ROM.6.14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace. 
ROM.6.15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid. 
ROM.6.16	Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves 
ROM.6.17	But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; 
ROM.6.18	and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members 
ROM.6.20	For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness. 
ROM.6.21	What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 
ROM.6.22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men that know the law), how that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth? 
ROM.7.2	For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband. 
ROM.7.3	So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man. 
ROM.7.4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, 
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
ROM.7.6	But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet: 
ROM.7.8	but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin 
ROM.7.9	And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died; 
ROM.7.10	and the commandment, which 
ROM.7.11	for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me. 
ROM.7.12	So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. 
ROM.7.13	Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shewn to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
ROM.7.15	For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do. 
ROM.7.16	But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good. 
ROM.7.17	So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good 
ROM.7.19	For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise. 
ROM.7.20	But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me. 
ROM.7.21	I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present. 
ROM.7.22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
ROM.7.23	but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members. 
ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? 
ROM.7.25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
ROM.8.1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death. 
ROM.8.3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and 
ROM.8.4	that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. 
ROM.8.5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. 
ROM.8.6	For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: 
ROM.8.7	because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: 
ROM.8.8	and they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 
ROM.8.9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
ROM.8.10	And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. 
ROM.8.11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 
ROM.8.12	So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: 
ROM.8.13	for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. 
ROM.8.14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 
ROM.8.15	For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 
ROM.8.16	The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:
ROM.8.17	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with 
ROM.8.18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward. 
ROM.8.19	For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God. 
ROM.8.20	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope 
ROM.8.21	that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. 
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 
ROM.8.23	And not only so, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for 
ROM.8.24	For by hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for that which we see not, 
ROM.8.26	And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for 
ROM.8.27	and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to 
ROM.8.28	And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, 
ROM.8.29	For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained 
ROM.8.30	and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What then shall we say to these things? If God 
ROM.8.32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth; 
ROM.8.34	who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 
ROM.8.36	Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 
ROM.8.37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 
ROM.8.39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Ghost, 
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service 
ROM.9.5	whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
ROM.9.6	But 
ROM.9.7	neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
ROM.9.8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed. 
ROM.9.9	For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. 
ROM.9.10	And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, 
ROM.9.11	for 
ROM.9.12	it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 
ROM.9.13	Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 
ROM.9.15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. 
ROM.9.16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy. 
ROM.9.17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might shew in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth. 
ROM.9.18	So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth. 
ROM.9.19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? 
ROM.9.20	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus? 
ROM.9.21	Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 
ROM.9.22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction: 
ROM.9.23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory, 
ROM.9.24	 us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
ROM.9.25	As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, which was not beloved. 
ROM.9.26	And it shall be, 
ROM.9.27	And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved: 
ROM.9.28	for the Lord will execute 
ROM.9.29	And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith: 
ROM.9.31	but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at 
ROM.9.32	Wherefore? Because 
ROM.9.33	even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart's desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved. 
ROM.10.2	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 
ROM.10.3	For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth. 
ROM.10.5	For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby. 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:) 
ROM.10.7	or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.) 
ROM.10.8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: 
ROM.10.9	because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus 
ROM.10.10	for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
ROM.10.11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
ROM.10.12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same 
ROM.10.13	for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 
ROM.10.15	and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things! 
ROM.10.16	But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 
ROM.10.17	So belief 
ROM.10.18	But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world. 
ROM.10.19	But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding will I anger you. 
ROM.10.20	And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me. 
ROM.10.21	But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
ROM.11.1	I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel, 
ROM.11.3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life. 
ROM.11.4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. 
ROM.11.5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 
ROM.11.6	But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. 
ROM.11.7	What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened: 
ROM.11.8	according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day. 
ROM.11.9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them: 
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back alway. 
ROM.11.11	I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation 
ROM.11.12	Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? 
ROM.11.13	But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry: 
ROM.11.14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy 
ROM.11.15	For if the casting away of them 
ROM.11.16	And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 
ROM.11.17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree; 
ROM.11.18	glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee. 
ROM.11.19	Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. 
ROM.11.20	Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
ROM.11.21	for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee. 
ROM.11.22	Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God's goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. 
ROM.11.23	And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which are the natural 
ROM.11.25	For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; 
ROM.11.26	and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
ROM.11.27	And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins. 
ROM.11.28	As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake. 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. 
ROM.11.30	For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shewn to you they also may now obtain mercy. 
ROM.11.32	For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways past tracing out! 
ROM.11.34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 
ROM.11.35	or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? 
ROM.11.36	For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him 
ROM.12.1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, 
ROM.12.2	And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. 
ROM.12.3	For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith. 
ROM.12.4	For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office: 
ROM.12.5	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. 
ROM.12.6	And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, 
ROM.12.7	or ministry, 
ROM.12.8	or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, 
ROM.12.9	Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 
ROM.12.10	In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honour preferring one another; 
ROM.12.11	in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer; 
ROM.12.13	communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. 
ROM.12.14	Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not. 
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep. 
ROM.12.16	Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits. 
ROM.12.17	Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honourable in the sight of all men. 
ROM.12.18	If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men. 
ROM.12.19	Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord. 
ROM.12.20	But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. 
ROM.12.21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the 
ROM.13.2	Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgement. 
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same: 
ROM.13.4	for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil. 
ROM.13.5	Wherefore 
ROM.13.6	For this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God's service, attending continually upon this very thing.
ROM.13.7	Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute 
ROM.13.8	Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law. 
ROM.13.9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
ROM.13.10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.
ROM.13.11	And this, knowing the season, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we 
ROM.13.12	The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to 
ROM.14.1	But him that is weak in faith receive ye, 
ROM.14.2	One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs. 
ROM.14.3	Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 
ROM.14.4	Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand. 
ROM.14.5	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day 
ROM.14.6	He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. 
ROM.14.7	For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. 
ROM.14.8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 
ROM.14.9	For to this end Christ died, and lived 
ROM.14.10	But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgement-seat of God. 
ROM.14.11	For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God. 
ROM.14.12	So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God. 
ROM.14.13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother's way, or an occasion of falling. 
ROM.14.14	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 
ROM.14.15	For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died. 
ROM.14.16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. 
ROM.14.18	For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men. 
ROM.14.19	So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another. 
ROM.14.20	Overthrow not for meat's sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. 
ROM.14.21	It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor 
ROM.14.22	The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth. 
ROM.14.23	But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because 
ROM.15.1	Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Let each one of us please his neighbour for that which is good, unto edifying. 
ROM.15.3	For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me. 
ROM.15.4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.
ROM.15.5	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus: 
ROM.15.6	that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God. 
ROM.15.8	For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises 
ROM.15.9	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name. 
ROM.15.10	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 
ROM.15.11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him. 
ROM.15.12	And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.
ROM.15.13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Ghost.
ROM.15.14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 
ROM.15.15	But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God, 
ROM.15.16	that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
ROM.15.17	I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God. 
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; 
ROM.15.20	yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was 
ROM.15.21	but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.
ROM.15.22	Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you: 
ROM.15.23	but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you, 
ROM.15.24	whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)-- 
ROM.15.25	but now, 
ROM.15.26	For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it 
ROM.15.28	When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain. 
ROM.15.29	And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.
ROM.15.30	Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; 
ROM.15.31	that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and 
ROM.15.32	that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest. 
ROM.15.33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae: 
ROM.16.2	that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a succourer of many, and of mine own self. 
ROM.16.3	Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus, 
ROM.16.4	who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles: 
ROM.16.5	and 
ROM.16.6	Salute Mary, who bestowed much labour on you. 
ROM.16.7	Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me. 
ROM.16.8	Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 
ROM.16.10	Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute them which are of the 
ROM.16.11	Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute them of the 
ROM.16.12	Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, which laboured much in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
ROM.16.14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them. 
ROM.16.15	Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them. 
ROM.16.16	Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
ROM.16.17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them. 
ROM.16.18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent. 
ROM.16.19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil. 
ROM.16.20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
ROM.16.21	Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen. 
ROM.16.22	I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord. 
ROM.16.23	Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.
ROM.16.25	Now to him that is able to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, 
ROM.16.26	but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith; 
ROM.16.27	to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
1CO.1.1	Paul, called 
1CO.1.2	unto the church of God which is at Corinth, 
1CO.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.4	I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus; 
1CO.1.5	that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge; 
1CO.1.6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
1CO.1.7	so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
1CO.1.8	who shall also confirm you unto the end, 
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and 
1CO.1.11	For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them 
1CO.1.12	Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
1CO.1.13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius; 
1CO.1.15	lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name. 
1CO.1.16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
1CO.1.17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void. 
1CO.1.18	For the word of the cross is to them that are perishing foolishness; but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the prudence of the prudent will I reject. 
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
1CO.1.21	For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe. 
1CO.1.22	Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom: 
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness; 
1CO.1.24	but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 
1CO.1.26	For behold your calling, brethren, how that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, 
1CO.1.27	but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong; 
1CO.1.28	and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, 
1CO.1.29	that no flesh should glory before God. 
1CO.1.30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption: 
1CO.1.31	that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
1CO.2.1	And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery of God. 
1CO.2.2	For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 
1CO.2.3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 
1CO.2.4	And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 
1CO.2.5	that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1CO.2.6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, which are coming to nought: 
1CO.2.7	but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, 
1CO.2.8	which none of the rulers of this world knoweth: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory: 
1CO.2.9	but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And 
1CO.2.10	But unto us God revealed 
1CO.2.11	For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God. 
1CO.2.13	Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 
1CO.2.14	Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged. 
1CO.2.15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man. 
1CO.2.16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. 
1CO.3.2	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able 
1CO.3.3	for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk after the manner of men? 
1CO.3.4	For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?
1CO.3.5	What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him. 
1CO.3.6	I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 
1CO.3.7	So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 
1CO.3.8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 
1CO.3.9	For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are God's husbandry, God's building. 
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.
1CO.3.11	For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
1CO.3.13	each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is. 
1CO.3.14	If any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
1CO.3.16	Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and 
1CO.3.17	If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which 
1CO.3.18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness: 
1CO.3.20	and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.
1CO.3.21	Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours; 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
1CO.3.23	and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
1CO.4.1	Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
1CO.4.2	Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgement: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
1CO.4.4	For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
1CO.4.5	Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God. 
1CO.4.6	Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not 
1CO.4.7	For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? 
1CO.4.8	Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have reigned without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
1CO.4.9	For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonour. 
1CO.4.11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; 
1CO.4.12	and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; 
1CO.4.13	being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.
1CO.4.14	I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 
1CO.4.15	For though ye should have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet 
1CO.4.16	I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
1CO.4.17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church. 
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them which are puffed up, but the power. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. 
1CO.4.21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one 
1CO.5.2	And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you. 
1CO.5.3	For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him that hath so wrought this thing, 
1CO.5.4	in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1CO.5.5	to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
1CO.5.6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1CO.5.7	Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, 
1CO.5.8	wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.9	I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; 
1CO.5.10	not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: 
1CO.5.11	but now I write unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat. 
1CO.5.12	For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within, 
1CO.5.13	whereas them that are without God judgeth? Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbour, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? 
1CO.6.2	Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
1CO.6.3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life? 
1CO.6.4	If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church? 
1CO.6.5	I say 
1CO.6.6	but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? 
1CO.6.7	Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? 
1CO.6.8	Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that 
1CO.6.9	Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, 
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. 
1CO.6.13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: 
1CO.6.14	and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power. 
1CO.6.15	Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid. 
1CO.6.16	Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh. 
1CO.6.17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
1CO.6.18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
1CO.6.19	Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; 
1CO.6.20	for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. 
1CO.7.2	But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife. 
1CO.7.5	Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. 
1CO.7.6	But this I say by way of permission, not of commandment. 
1CO.7.7	Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that. 
1CO.7.8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 
1CO.7.9	But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1CO.7.10	But unto the married I give charge, 
1CO.7.11	(but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife. 
1CO.7.12	But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. 
1CO.7.13	And the woman which hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 
1CO.7.15	Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such 
1CO.7.16	For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
1CO.7.17	Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. 
1CO.7.20	Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. 
1CO.7.21	Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: but if thou canst become free, use 
1CO.7.22	For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant. 
1CO.7.23	Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. 
1CO.7.24	Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1CO.7.26	I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, 
1CO.7.27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you. 
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; 
1CO.7.30	and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; 
1CO.7.31	and those that use the world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. 
1CO.7.32	But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 
1CO.7.33	but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife. 
1CO.7.34	And there is a difference also between the wife and the virgin. She that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1CO.7.36	But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin 
1CO.7.37	But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin 
1CO.7.38	So then both he that giveth his own virgin 
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgement: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. 
1CO.8.2	If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; 
1CO.8.3	but if any man loveth God, the same is known of him.
1CO.8.4	Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is 
1CO.8.5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; 
1CO.8.6	yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
1CO.8.7	Howbeit in all men there is not that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as 
1CO.8.8	But meat will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. 
1CO.8.9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	For if a man see thee which hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 
1CO.8.11	For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. 
1CO.8.12	And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I make not my brother to stumble.
1CO.9.1	Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	My defence to them that examine me is this. 
1CO.9.4	Have we no right to eat and to drink? 
1CO.9.5	Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
1CO.9.6	Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working? 
1CO.9.7	What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 
1CO.9.8	Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same? 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth, 
1CO.9.10	or saith he it altogether for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, 
1CO.9.11	If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things? 
1CO.9.12	If others partake of 
1CO.9.13	Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat 
1CO.9.14	Even so did the Lord ordain that they which proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case: for 
1CO.9.16	For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. 
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	For though I was free from all 
1CO.9.20	And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 
1CO.9.21	to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. 
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. 
1CO.9.23	And I do all things for the gospel's sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.
1CO.9.24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run, that ye may attain. 
1CO.9.25	And every man that striveth in the games is temperate in all things. Now they 
1CO.9.26	I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: 
1CO.9.27	but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
1CO.10.1	For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 
1CO.10.2	and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
1CO.10.3	and did all eat the same spiritual meat; 
1CO.10.4	and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 
1CO.10.7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 
1CO.10.8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 
1CO.10.9	Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents. 
1CO.10.10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. 
1CO.10.11	Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. 
1CO.10.12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 
1CO.10.13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it. 
1CO.10.14	Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
1CO.10.15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread. 
1CO.10.18	Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? 
1CO.10.19	What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	But 
1CO.10.21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils. 
1CO.10.22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful; but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful; but all things edify not. 
1CO.10.24	Let no man seek his own, but 
1CO.10.25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience sake; 
1CO.10.26	for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. 
1CO.10.27	If one of them that believe not biddeth you 
1CO.10.28	But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: 
1CO.10.29	conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? 
1CO.10.30	If I by grace partake, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? 
1CO.10.31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God: 
1CO.10.33	even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the 
1CO.11.1	Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. 
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. 
1CO.11.3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. 
1CO.11.5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoureth her head: for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. 
1CO.11.7	For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
1CO.11.8	For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: 
1CO.11.9	for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: 
1CO.11.10	for this cause ought the woman to have 
1CO.11.11	Howbeit neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. 
1CO.11.12	For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God. 
1CO.11.13	Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled? 
1CO.11.14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonour to him? 
1CO.11.15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 
1CO.11.16	But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it. 
1CO.11.19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. 
1CO.11.20	When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper: 
1CO.11.21	for in your eating each one taketh before 
1CO.11.22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
1CO.11.23	For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, how that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; 
1CO.11.24	and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
1CO.11.25	In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as oft as ye drink 
1CO.11.26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come. 
1CO.11.27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgement unto himself, if he discern not the body. 
1CO.11.30	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. 
1CO.11.31	But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. 
1CO.11.33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another. 
1CO.11.34	If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgement. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual 
1CO.12.2	Ye know that when ye were Gentiles 
1CO.12.3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. 
1CO.12.4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
1CO.12.5	And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. 
1CO.12.7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. 
1CO.12.8	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: 
1CO.12.9	to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; 
1CO.12.10	and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another 
1CO.12.11	but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
1CO.12.12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. 
1CO.12.13	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. 
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 
1CO.12.18	But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. 
1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where were the body? 
1CO.12.20	But now they are many members, but one body. 
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
1CO.12.22	Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: 
1CO.12.23	and those 
1CO.12.24	whereas our comely 
1CO.12.25	that there should be no schism in the body; but 
1CO.12.26	And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or 
1CO.12.27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof. 
1CO.12.28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, 
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all 
1CO.12.30	have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 
1CO.12.31	But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.
1CO.13.1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	And if I have 
1CO.13.3	And if I bestow all my goods to feed 
1CO.13.4	Love suffereth long, 
1CO.13.5	doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; 
1CO.13.6	rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; 
1CO.13.7	beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1CO.13.8	Love never faileth: but whether 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: 
1CO.13.10	but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I have been known. 
1CO.13.13	But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual 
1CO.14.2	For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
1CO.14.3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and comfort, and consolation. 
1CO.14.4	He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. 
1CO.14.5	Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1CO.14.6	But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching? 
1CO.14.7	Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? 
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war? 
1CO.14.9	So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no 
1CO.14.11	If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me. 
1CO.14.12	So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual 
1CO.14.13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. 
1CO.14.16	Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest? 
1CO.14.17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. 
1CO.14.18	I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all: 
1CO.14.19	howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue. 
1CO.14.20	Brethren, be not children in mind: howbeit in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.
1CO.14.21	In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord. 
1CO.14.22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying 
1CO.14.23	If therefore the whole church be assembled together, and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad? 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all; 
1CO.14.25	the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
1CO.14.26	What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
1CO.14.27	If any man speaketh in a tongue, 
1CO.14.28	but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
1CO.14.29	And let the prophets speak 
1CO.14.30	But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence. 
1CO.14.31	For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted; 
1CO.14.32	and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets; 
1CO.14.33	for God is not 
1CO.14.34	Let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law. 
1CO.14.35	And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.
1CO.14.36	What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone? 
1CO.14.37	If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord. 
1CO.14.38	But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant. 
1CO.14.39	Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. 
1CO.14.40	But let all things be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand, 
1CO.15.2	by which also ye are saved; 
1CO.15.3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1CO.15.4	and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures; 
1CO.15.5	and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; 
1CO.15.6	then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep; 
1CO.15.7	then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; 
1CO.15.8	and last of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared to me also. 
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
1CO.15.11	Whether then 
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised: 
1CO.15.14	and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain. 
1CO.15.15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised: 
1CO.15.17	and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 
1CO.15.19	If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable.
1CO.15.20	But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep. 
1CO.15.21	For since by man 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. 
1CO.15.24	Then 
1CO.15.25	For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy that shall be abolished is death. 
1CO.15.27	For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him. 
1CO.15.28	And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all. 
1CO.15.29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them? 
1CO.15.30	Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 
1CO.15.32	If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. 
1CO.15.33	Be not deceived: Evil company doth corrupt good manners. 
1CO.15.34	Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak 
1CO.15.35	But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come? 
1CO.15.36	Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened, except it die: 
1CO.15.37	and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind; 
1CO.15.38	but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own. 
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one 
1CO.15.40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the 
1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. 
1CO.15.42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 
1CO.15.43	it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
1CO.15.44	it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual 
1CO.15.45	So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam 
1CO.15.46	Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. 
1CO.15.48	As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. 
1CO.15.49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. 
1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1CO.15.51	Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 
1CO.15.54	But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 
1CO.15.55	O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? 
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law: 
1CO.15.57	but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. 
1CO.16.2	Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come. 
1CO.16.3	And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem: 
1CO.16.4	and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.
1CO.16.5	But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I do pass through Macedonia; 
1CO.16.6	but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go. 
1CO.16.7	For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 
1CO.16.8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost; 
1CO.16.9	for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1CO.16.10	Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do: 
1CO.16.11	let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren. 
1CO.16.12	But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all 
1CO.16.13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1CO.16.14	Let all that ye do be done in love. 
1CO.16.15	Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints), 
1CO.16.16	that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboureth. 
1CO.16.17	And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied. 
1CO.16.18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
1CO.16.20	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss. 
1CO.16.21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. 
1CO.16.22	If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha. 
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
1CO.16.24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2CO.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in the whole of Achaia: 
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Blessed 
2CO.1.4	who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. 
2CO.1.5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ. 
2CO.1.6	But whether we be afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we be comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:
2CO.1.7	and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort. 
2CO.1.8	For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell 
2CO.1.9	yea, we ourselves have had the answer of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
2CO.1.10	who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us; 
2CO.1.11	ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
2CO.1.12	For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. 
2CO.1.13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end: 
2CO.1.14	as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	And in this confidence I was minded to come before unto you, that ye might have a second benefit; 
2CO.1.16	and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea. 
2CO.1.17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I shew fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay? 
2CO.1.18	But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay. 
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, 
2CO.1.20	For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us. 
2CO.1.21	Now he that stablisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God; 
2CO.1.22	who also sealed us, and gave 
2CO.1.23	But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth. 
2CO.1.24	Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
2CO.2.1	But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow. 
2CO.2.2	For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad, but he that is made sorry by me? 
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is 
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
2CO.2.5	But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all. 
2CO.2.6	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was 
2CO.2.7	so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow. 
2CO.2.8	Wherefore I beseech you to confirm 
2CO.2.9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things. 
2CO.2.10	But to whom ye forgive anything, I 
2CO.2.11	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2CO.2.12	Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord, 
2CO.2.13	I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia. 
2CO.2.14	But thanks be unto God, which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savour of his knowledge in every place. 
2CO.2.15	For we are a sweet savour of Christ unto God, in them that are being saved, and in them that are perishing; 
2CO.2.16	to the one a savour from death unto death; to the other a savour from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? 
2CO.2.17	For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you? 
2CO.3.2	Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men; 
2CO.3.3	being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables 
2CO.3.4	And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward: 
2CO.3.5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
2CO.3.6	who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 
2CO.3.7	But if the ministration of death, written, 
2CO.3.8	how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory? 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministration of condemnation is glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
2CO.3.10	For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth. 
2CO.3.11	For if that which passeth away 
2CO.3.12	Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech, 
2CO.3.13	and 
2CO.3.14	but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted; which 
2CO.3.15	But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart. 
2CO.3.16	But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, 
2CO.3.18	But we all, with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.
2CO.4.1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not: 
2CO.4.2	but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 
2CO.4.3	But and if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that are perishing: 
2CO.4.4	in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn 
2CO.4.5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. 
2CO.4.6	Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;
2CO.4.9	pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed; 
2CO.4.10	always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body. 
2CO.4.11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 
2CO.4.12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
2CO.4.13	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak; 
2CO.4.14	knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you. 
2CO.4.15	For all things 
2CO.4.16	Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. 
2CO.4.17	For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; 
2CO.4.18	while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. 
2CO.5.2	For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven: 
2CO.5.3	if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life. 
2CO.5.5	Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 
2CO.5.6	Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord 
2CO.5.7	(for we walk by faith, not by sight); 
2CO.5.8	we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all be made manifest before the judgement-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things 
2CO.5.11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
2CO.5.12	We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but 
2CO.5.13	For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you. 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died; 
2CO.5.15	and he died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.
2CO.5.16	Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know 
2CO.5.17	Wherefore if any man is in Christ, 
2CO.5.18	But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation; 
2CO.5.19	to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.20	We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech 
2CO.5.21	Him who knew no sin he made 
2CO.6.1	And working together 
2CO.6.2	(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succour thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation): 
2CO.6.3	giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed; 
2CO.6.4	but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
2CO.6.5	in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 
2CO.6.6	in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned, 
2CO.6.7	in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
2CO.6.8	by glory and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and 
2CO.6.9	as unknown, and 
2CO.6.10	as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and 
2CO.6.11	Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged. 
2CO.6.12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections. 
2CO.6.13	Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto 
2CO.6.14	Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
2CO.6.17	Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you, 
2CO.6.18	And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. 
2CO.7.2	Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man. 
2CO.7.3	I say it not to condemn 
2CO.7.4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
2CO.7.5	For even when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but 
2CO.7.6	Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly, 
2CO.7.7	and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more. 
2CO.7.8	For though I made you sorry with my epistle, I do not regret it, though I did regret; for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season. 
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing. 
2CO.7.10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, 
2CO.7.11	For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what longing, yea, what zeal, yea, what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.
2CO.7.12	So although I wrote unto you, 
2CO.7.13	Therefore we have been comforted: and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all. 
2CO.7.14	For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also, which I made before Titus, was found to be truth. 
2CO.7.15	And his inward affection is more abundantly toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.
2CO.8.1	Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia; 
2CO.8.2	how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
2CO.8.3	For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, 
2CO.8.4	beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: 
2CO.8.5	and 
2CO.8.6	Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.
2CO.8.7	But as ye abound in everything, 
2CO.8.8	I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. 
2CO.8.9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. 
2CO.8.10	And herein I give 
2CO.8.11	But now complete the doing also; that as 
2CO.8.12	For if the readiness is there, 
2CO.8.13	For 
2CO.8.14	but by equality; your abundance 
2CO.8.15	as it is written, He that 
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God, which putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. 
2CO.8.17	For indeed he accepted our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord. 
2CO.8.18	And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel 
2CO.8.19	and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in 
2CO.8.20	Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in 
2CO.8.21	for we take thought for things honourable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
2CO.8.22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which 
2CO.8.23	Whether 
2CO.8.24	Shew ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.
2CO.9.1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
2CO.9.2	for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them. 
2CO.9.3	But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared: 
2CO.9.4	lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence. 
2CO.9.5	I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.
2CO.9.6	But this 
2CO.9.7	 each man 
2CO.9.8	And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: 
2CO.9.9	as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever. 
2CO.9.10	And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: 
2CO.9.11	ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.12	For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God; 
2CO.9.13	seeing that through the proving 
2CO.9.14	while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
2CO.10.1	Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you: 
2CO.10.2	yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present shew courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, which count of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh 
2CO.10.4	(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strong holds); 
2CO.10.5	casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ; 
2CO.10.6	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.
2CO.10.7	Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also are we. 
2CO.10.8	For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame: 
2CO.10.9	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters. 
2CO.10.10	For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account. 
2CO.10.11	Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such 
2CO.10.12	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding. 
2CO.10.13	But we will not glory beyond 
2CO.10.14	For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ: 
2CO.10.15	not glorying beyond 
2CO.10.16	so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, 
2CO.10.17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
2CO.10.18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
2CO.11.1	Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: nay indeed bear with me. 
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you 
2CO.11.3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ. 
2CO.11.4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or 
2CO.11.5	For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
2CO.11.6	But though 
2CO.11.7	Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought? 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches, taking wages 
2CO.11.9	and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and 
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia. 
2CO.11.11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
2CO.11.12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
2CO.11.13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
2CO.11.16	I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if 
2CO.11.17	That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying. 
2CO.11.18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
2CO.11.19	For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise 
2CO.11.20	For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you 
2CO.11.21	I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labours more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft. 
2CO.11.24	Of the Jews five times received I forty 
2CO.11.25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep; 
2CO.11.26	 journeyings often, 
2CO.11.27	 labour and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
2CO.11.28	Beside those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is made to stumble, and I burn not? 
2CO.11.30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes, in order to take me: 
2CO.11.33	and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2CO.12.1	I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and Revelation of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven. 
2CO.12.3	And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth), 
2CO.12.4	how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
2CO.12.5	On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in 
2CO.12.6	For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me 
2CO.12.7	And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the Revelation--wherefore, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch. 
2CO.12.8	Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 
2CO.12.9	And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for 
2CO.12.10	Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2CO.12.11	I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. 
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. 
2CO.12.13	For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except 
2CO.12.14	Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
2CO.12.15	And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? 
2CO.12.16	But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 
2CO.12.17	Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? 
2CO.12.18	I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not by the same Spirit? 
2CO.12.19	Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, 
2CO.12.20	For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means 
2CO.12.21	lest, when I come again, my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word be established. 
2CO.13.2	I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare; 
2CO.13.3	seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you: 
2CO.13.4	for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you. 
2CO.13.5	Try your own selves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate. 
2CO.13.6	But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.
2CO.13.7	Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honourable, though we be as reprobate. 
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting. 
2CO.13.10	For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you. 
2CO.13.12	Salute one another with a holy kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All the saints salute you. 
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), 
GAL.1.2	and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
GAL.1.4	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father: 
GAL.1.5	to whom 
GAL.1.6	I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel; 
GAL.1.7	which is not another 
GAL.1.8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. 
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.
GAL.1.10	For am I now persuading men, or God? or am I seeking to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. 
GAL.1.11	For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. 
GAL.1.12	For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but 
GAL.1.13	For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havock of it: 
GAL.1.14	and I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 
GAL.1.15	But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, 
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
GAL.1.17	neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus. 
GAL.1.18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. 
GAL.1.19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. 
GAL.1.20	Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 
GAL.1.21	Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 
GAL.1.23	but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havock; 
GAL.1.24	and they glorified God in me.
GAL.2.1	Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. 
GAL.2.2	And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain. 
GAL.2.3	But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: 
GAL.2.4	and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 
GAL.2.5	to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
GAL.2.6	But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man's person)--they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me: 
GAL.2.7	but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with 
GAL.2.8	(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles); 
GAL.2.9	and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision; 
GAL.2.10	only 
GAL.2.11	But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned. 
GAL.2.12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision. 
GAL.2.13	And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before 
GAL.2.15	We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 
GAL.2.16	yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, save through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
GAL.2.17	But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid. 
GAL.2.18	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor. 
GAL.2.19	For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God. 
GAL.2.20	I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live; 
GAL.2.21	I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified? 
GAL.3.2	This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
GAL.3.3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? 
GAL.3.4	Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain. 
GAL.3.5	He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, 
GAL.3.6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. 
GAL.3.7	Know therefore that they which be of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. 
GAL.3.8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, 
GAL.3.9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. 
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one which continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. 
GAL.3.11	Now that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith; 
GAL.3.12	and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them. 
GAL.3.13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 
GAL.3.14	that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto. 
GAL.3.16	Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 
GAL.3.17	Now this I say; A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.
GAL.3.19	What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; 
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not 
GAL.3.21	Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law. 
GAL.3.22	Howbeit the scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
GAL.3.24	So that the law hath been our tutor 
GAL.3.25	But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor. 
GAL.3.26	For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.27	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ. 
GAL.3.28	There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female: for ye all are one 
GAL.3.29	And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.
GAL.4.1	But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant, though he is lord of all; 
GAL.4.2	but is under guardians and stewards until the term appointed of the father. 
GAL.4.3	So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world: 
GAL.4.4	but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 
GAL.4.5	that he might redeem them which were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 
GAL.4.6	And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 
GAL.4.7	So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
GAL.4.8	Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them which by nature are no gods: 
GAL.4.9	but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known of God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again? 
GAL.4.10	Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years. 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.
GAL.4.12	I beseech you, brethren, be as I 
GAL.4.13	but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time: 
GAL.4.14	and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, 
GAL.4.15	Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. 
GAL.4.16	So then am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them. 
GAL.4.18	But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.
GAL.4.19	My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you, 
GAL.4.20	yea, I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 
GAL.4.22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman. 
GAL.4.23	Howbeit the 
GAL.4.24	Which things contain an allegory: for these 
GAL.4.25	Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her which hath the husband. 
GAL.4.28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 
GAL.4.29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him 
GAL.4.30	Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman. 
GAL.4.31	Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.
GAL.5.1	With freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage. 
GAL.5.2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. 
GAL.5.3	Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
GAL.5.4	Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. 
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. 
GAL.5.6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love. 
GAL.5.7	Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 
GAL.5.8	This persuasion 
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgement, whosoever he be. 
GAL.5.11	But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumblingblock of the cross been done away. 
GAL.5.12	I would that they which unsettle you would even cut themselves off.
GAL.5.13	For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only 
GAL.5.14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, 
GAL.5.15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 
GAL.5.16	But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 
GAL.5.17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would. 
GAL.5.18	But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 
GAL.5.19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, heresies, 
GAL.5.21	envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they which practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof. 
GAL.5.25	If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk. 
GAL.5.26	Let us not be vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of meekness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 
GAL.6.2	Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
GAL.6.4	But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbour. 
GAL.6.5	For each man shall bear his own burden. 
GAL.6.6	But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 
GAL.6.7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 
GAL.6.8	For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. 
GAL.6.9	And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 
GAL.6.10	So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.
GAL.6.11	See with how large letters I have written unto you with mine own hand. 
GAL.6.12	As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 
GAL.6.14	But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 
GAL.6.15	For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 
GAL.6.16	And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace 
GAL.6.17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus. 
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Blessed 
EPH.1.4	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love: 
EPH.1.5	having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: 
EPH.1.7	in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 
EPH.1.8	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 
EPH.1.9	having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 
EPH.1.10	unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, 
EPH.1.11	in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will; 
EPH.1.12	to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: 
EPH.1.13	in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,--in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 
EPH.1.14	which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of 
EPH.1.15	For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and which 
EPH.1.16	cease not to give thanks for you, making mention 
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; 
EPH.1.18	having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 
EPH.1.19	and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might 
EPH.1.20	which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly 
EPH.1.21	far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 
EPH.1.22	and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, 
EPH.1.23	which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
EPH.2.1	And you 
EPH.2.2	wherein aforetime ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; 
EPH.2.3	among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:--
EPH.2.4	but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 
EPH.2.5	even when we were dead through our trespasses, quickened us together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved), 
EPH.2.6	and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly 
EPH.2.7	that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus: 
EPH.2.8	for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: 
EPH.2.9	not of works, that no man should glory. 
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.
EPH.2.11	Wherefore remember, that aforetime ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; 
EPH.2.12	that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition, 
EPH.2.15	having abolished in his flesh the enmity, 
EPH.2.16	and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 
EPH.2.17	and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh: 
EPH.2.18	for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father. 
EPH.2.19	So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, 
EPH.2.20	being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; 
EPH.2.21	in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; 
EPH.2.22	in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,-- 
EPH.3.2	if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward; 
EPH.3.3	how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote afore in few words, 
EPH.3.4	whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; 
EPH.3.5	which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 
EPH.3.6	, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 
EPH.3.7	whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. 
EPH.3.8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 
EPH.3.9	and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which from all ages hath been hid in God who created all things; 
EPH.3.10	to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly 
EPH.3.11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. 
EPH.3.13	Wherefore I ask that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
EPH.3.14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
EPH.3.16	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; 
EPH.3.17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
EPH.3.18	may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 
EPH.3.19	and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God. 
EPH.3.20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
EPH.3.21	unto him 
EPH.4.1	I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,
EPH.4.2	with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 
EPH.4.3	giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
EPH.4.4	 one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling; 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. 
EPH.4.7	But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
EPH.4.8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men. 
EPH.4.9	(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 
EPH.4.10	He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) 
EPH.4.11	And he gave some 
EPH.4.12	for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ: 
EPH.4.13	till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
EPH.4.14	that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; 
EPH.4.15	but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, which is the head, 
EPH.4.16	from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in 
EPH.4.17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
EPH.4.18	being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart; 
EPH.4.19	who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 
EPH.4.20	But ye did not so learn Christ; 
EPH.4.21	if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus: 
EPH.4.22	that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, which waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit; 
EPH.4.23	and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 
EPH.4.24	and put on the new man, which after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth. 
EPH.4.25	Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. 
EPH.4.26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
EPH.4.27	neither give place to the devil. 
EPH.4.28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need. 
EPH.4.29	Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear. 
EPH.4.30	And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice: 
EPH.4.32	and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.
EPH.5.1	Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; 
EPH.5.2	and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell.
EPH.5.3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 
EPH.5.4	nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks. 
EPH.5.5	For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 
EPH.5.6	Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them; 
EPH.5.8	For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 
EPH.5.10	proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; 
EPH.5.11	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; 
EPH.5.12	for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. 
EPH.5.13	But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. 
EPH.5.14	Wherefore 
EPH.5.15	Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; 
EPH.5.16	redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 
EPH.5.18	And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; 
EPH.5.19	speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 
EPH.5.20	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
EPH.5.21	subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. 
EPH.5.22	Wives, 
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, 
EPH.5.24	But as the church is subject to Christ, so 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; 
EPH.5.26	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 
EPH.5.27	that he might present the church to himself a glorious 
EPH.5.28	Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: 
EPH.5.29	for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; 
EPH.5.30	because we are members of his body. 
EPH.5.31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh. 
EPH.5.32	This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church. 
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and 
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 
EPH.6.2	Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise), 
EPH.6.3	that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 
EPH.6.4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord. 
EPH.6.5	Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 
EPH.6.6	not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 
EPH.6.7	with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men: 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether 
EPH.6.9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual 
EPH.6.13	Wherefore take up the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. 
EPH.6.14	Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 
EPH.6.15	and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
EPH.6.16	withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil 
EPH.6.17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
EPH.6.18	with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,
EPH.6.19	And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 
EPH.6.21	But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
EPH.6.22	whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts. 
EPH.6.23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in uncorruptness.
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, 
PHP.1.4	always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, 
PHP.1.5	for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now; 
PHP.1.6	being confident of this very thing, that he which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:
PHP.1.7	even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; 
PHP.1.10	so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ; 
PHP.1.11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.12	Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things 
PHP.1.13	so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; 
PHP.1.14	and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. 
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 
PHP.1.16	the one 
PHP.1.17	but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds. 
PHP.1.18	What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 
PHP.1.19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
PHP.1.20	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but 
PHP.1.21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
PHP.1.22	But if to live in the flesh,-- 
PHP.1.23	But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: 
PHP.1.24	yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. 
PHP.1.25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; 
PHP.1.26	that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
PHP.1.27	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel; 
PHP.1.28	and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; 
PHP.1.29	because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: 
PHP.1.30	having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
PHP.2.1	If there is therefore any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions, 
PHP.2.2	fulfill ye my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; 
PHP.2.3	 nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; 
PHP.2.4	not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. 
PHP.2.5	Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
PHP.2.6	who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God, 
PHP.2.7	but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; 
PHP.2.8	and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient 
PHP.2.9	Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; 
PHP.2.10	that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of 
PHP.2.11	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 
PHP.2.13	for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
PHP.2.14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings; 
PHP.2.15	that ye may be blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, 
PHP.2.16	holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labour in vain. 
PHP.2.17	Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all: 
PHP.2.18	and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me. 
PHP.2.19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 
PHP.2.20	For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state. 
PHP.2.21	For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child 
PHP.2.23	Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me: 
PHP.2.24	but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly. 
PHP.2.25	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need; 
PHP.2.26	since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick: 
PHP.2.27	for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 
PHP.2.29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honour: 
PHP.2.30	because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe. 
PHP.3.2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision: 
PHP.3.3	for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:
PHP.3.4	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more: 
PHP.3.5	circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; 
PHP.3.6	as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless. 
PHP.3.7	Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ. 
PHP.3.8	Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ,
PHP.3.9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, 
PHP.3.10	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death; 
PHP.3.11	if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead. 
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may apprehend that for which also I was apprehended by Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I count not myself yet to have apprehended: but one thing 
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
PHP.3.15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you: 
PHP.3.16	only, whereunto we have already attained, by that same 
PHP.3.17	Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them which so walk even as ye have us for an ensample. 
PHP.3.18	For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, 
PHP.3.19	whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and 
PHP.3.20	For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
PHP.3.21	who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, 
PHP.4.1	Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved. 
PHP.4.2	I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life. 
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: again I will say, Rejoice. 
PHP.4.5	Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 
PHP.4.6	In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 
PHP.4.9	The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
PHP.4.10	But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity. 
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content. 
PHP.4.12	I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me. 
PHP.4.14	Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction. 
PHP.4.15	And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only; 
PHP.4.16	for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need. 
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account. 
PHP.4.18	But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things 
PHP.4.19	And my God shall fulfill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.20	Now unto our God and Father 
PHP.4.21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me salute you. 
PHP.4.22	All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household. 
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
COL.1.2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ 
COL.1.3	We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
COL.1.4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints, 
COL.1.5	because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel, 
COL.1.6	which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as 
COL.1.7	even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, 
COL.1.8	who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard 
COL.1.10	to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
COL.1.11	strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;
COL.1.12	giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; 
COL.1.13	who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love; 
COL.1.14	in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins: 
COL.1.15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; 
COL.1.16	for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him; 
COL.1.17	and he is before all things, and in him all things consist. 
COL.1.18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. 
COL.1.19	For it was the good pleasure 
COL.1.20	and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, 
COL.1.21	And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works, yet now hath he reconciled 
COL.1.22	in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him: 
COL.1.23	if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister. 
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church; 
COL.1.25	whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfill the word of God, 
COL.1.26	 the mystery which hath been hid from all ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints, 
COL.1.27	to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: 
COL.1.28	whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ; 
COL.1.29	whereunto I labour also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
COL.2.1	For I would have you know how greatly I strive for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; 
COL.2.2	that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, 
COL.2.3	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.
COL.2.4	This I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech. 
COL.2.5	For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
COL.2.6	As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, 
COL.2.7	rooted and builded up in him, and stablished in your faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. 
COL.2.8	Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ: 
COL.2.9	for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, 
COL.2.10	and in him ye are made full, who is the head of all principality and power: 
COL.2.11	in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; 
COL.2.12	having been buried with him in baptism, wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
COL.2.13	And you, being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, 
COL.2.14	having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross; 
COL.2.15	having put off from himself the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
COL.2.16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day: 
COL.2.17	which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's. 
COL.2.18	Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 
COL.2.19	and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increaseth with the increase of God. 
COL.2.20	If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, 
COL.2.21	Handle not, nor taste, nor touch 
COL.2.22	(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men? 
COL.2.23	Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body; 
COL.3.1	If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth. 
COL.3.3	For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ, 
COL.3.5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry; 
COL.3.6	for which things' sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience; 
COL.3.7	in the which ye also walked aforetime, when ye lived in these things.
COL.3.8	But now put ye also away all these; anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: 
COL.3.9	lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings, 
COL.3.10	and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him: 
COL.3.11	where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman: but Christ is all, and in all.
COL.3.12	Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; 
COL.3.13	forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye: 
COL.3.14	and above all these things 
COL.3.15	And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful. 
COL.3.16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another with psalms 
COL.3.17	And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, 
COL.3.18	Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord. 
COL.3.21	Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged. 
COL.3.22	Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: 
COL.3.23	whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men; 
COL.3.24	knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ. 
COL.3.25	For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
COL.4.1	Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving; 
COL.4.3	withal praying for us also, that God may open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; 
COL.4.4	that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.5	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 
COL.4.6	Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.
COL.4.7	All my affairs shall Tychicus make known unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord: 
COL.4.8	whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our estate, and that he may comfort your hearts; 
COL.4.9	together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things that 
COL.4.10	Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him), 
COL.4.11	and Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only 
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. 
COL.4.13	For I bear him witness, that he hath much labour for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you. 
COL.4.15	Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in their house. 
COL.4.16	And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea. 
COL.4.17	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it. 
COL.4.18	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
1TH.1.1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention 
1TH.1.3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; 
1TH.1.4	knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election, 
1TH.1.5	how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and 
1TH.1.6	And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost; 
1TH.1.7	so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
1TH.1.8	For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 
1TH.1.10	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, 
1TH.2.1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain: 
1TH.2.2	but having suffered before, and been shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict. 
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation 
1TH.2.4	but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God which proveth our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness, God is witness; 
1TH.2.6	nor seeking glory of men, neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdensome, as apostles of Christ.
1TH.2.7	But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children: 
1TH.2.8	even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us. 
1TH.2.9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. 
1TH.2.10	Ye are witnesses, and God 
1TH.2.11	as ye know how we 
1TH.2.12	to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, 
1TH.2.14	For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews; 
1TH.2.15	who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drave out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men; 
1TH.2.16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins alway: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire: 
1TH.2.18	because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us. 
1TH.2.19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming? 
1TH.2.20	For ye are our glory and our joy.
1TH.3.1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone; 
1TH.3.2	and sent Timothy, our brother and God's minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort 
1TH.3.3	that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed. 
1TH.3.4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know. 
1TH.3.5	For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labour should be in vain.
1TH.3.6	But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also 
1TH.3.7	for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith: 
1TH.3.8	for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 
1TH.3.10	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you: 
1TH.3.12	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also 
1TH.3.13	to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk,--that ye abound more and more. 
1TH.4.2	For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, 
1TH.4.4	that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honour, 
1TH.4.5	not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles which know not God; 
1TH.4.6	that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified. 
1TH.4.7	For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification. 
1TH.4.8	Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.
1TH.4.9	But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another; 
1TH.4.10	for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more; 
1TH.4.11	and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you; 
1TH.4.12	that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.
1TH.4.13	But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, which have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
1TH.4.15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep. 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 
1TH.4.17	then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 
1TH.4.18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you. 
1TH.5.2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape. 
1TH.5.4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief: 
1TH.5.5	for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;
1TH.5.6	so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober. 
1TH.5.7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 
1TH.5.8	But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1TH.5.9	For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.5.10	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1TH.5.11	Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do. 
1TH.5.12	But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
1TH.5.13	and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. 
1TH.5.14	And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all. 
1TH.5.15	See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but alway follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.
1TH.5.16	Rejoice alway; 
1TH.5.17	pray without ceasing; 
1TH.5.18	in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward. 
1TH.5.19	Quench not the Spirit; 
1TH.5.20	despise not prophesyings; 
1TH.5.21	prove all things; hold fast that which is good; 
1TH.5.22	abstain from every form of evil.
1TH.5.23	And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.24	Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it. 
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us. 
1TH.5.26	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. 
1TH.5.27	I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren. 
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; 
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.1.3	We are bound to give thanks to God alway for you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth; 
2TH.1.4	so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure;
2TH.1.6	if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you, 
2TH.1.7	and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power 
2TH.1.8	in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 
2TH.1.9	who shall suffer punishment, 
2TH.1.10	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.
2TH.1.11	To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and 
2TH.1.12	that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him; 
2TH.2.2	to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is 
2TH.2.3	let no man beguile you in any wise: for 
2TH.2.4	he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. 
2TH.2.5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only 
2TH.2.8	And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming; 
2TH.2.9	, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 
2TH.2.10	and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are perishing; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
2TH.2.11	And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie: 
2TH.2.12	that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2TH.2.13	But we are bound to give thanks to God alway for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 
2TH.2.14	whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.2.15	So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.
2TH.2.16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father which loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 
2TH.2.17	comfort your hearts and stablish them in every good work and word.
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also 
2TH.3.2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith. 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and guard you from the evil 
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command. 
2TH.3.5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us. 
2TH.3.7	For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; 
2TH.3.8	neither did we eat bread for nought at any man's hand, but in labour and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you: 
2TH.3.9	not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us. 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat. 
2TH.3.11	For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies. 
2TH.3.12	Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. 
2TH.3.13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing. 
2TH.3.14	And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	And 
2TH.3.16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all. 
2TH.3.17	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. 
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope; 
1TI.1.2	unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1TI.1.3	As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, 
1TI.1.4	neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, the which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; 
1TI.1.5	But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned: 
1TI.1.6	from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking; 
1TI.1.7	desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm. 
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, 
1TI.1.9	as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
1TI.1.10	for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; 
1TI.1.11	according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1TI.1.12	I thank him that enabled me, 
1TI.1.13	though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief; 
1TI.1.14	and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.1.15	Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief: 
1TI.1.16	howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ shew forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them which should hereafter believe on him unto eternal life. 
1TI.1.17	Now unto the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, 
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare; 
1TI.1.19	holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith: 
1TI.1.20	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; 
1TI.2.2	for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. 
1TI.2.3	This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 
1TI.2.4	who willeth that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, 
1TI.2.6	who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony 
1TI.2.7	whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 
1TI.2.8	I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
1TI.2.9	In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 
1TI.2.10	but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works. 
1TI.2.11	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. 
1TI.2.12	But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. 
1TI.2.13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 
1TI.2.14	and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 
1TI.2.15	but she shall be saved through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
1TI.3.1	Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. 
1TI.3.2	The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, soberminded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 
1TI.3.3	no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money; 
1TI.3.4	one that ruleth well his own house, having 
1TI.3.5	(but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) 
1TI.3.6	not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil. 
1TI.3.7	Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1TI.3.8	Deacons in like manner 
1TI.3.9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1TI.3.10	And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless. 
1TI.3.11	Women in like manner 
1TI.3.12	Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling 
1TI.3.13	For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly; 
1TI.3.15	but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 
1TI.3.16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; He who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up in glory.
1TI.4.1	But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, 
1TI.4.2	through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; 
1TI.4.3	forbidding to marry, 
1TI.4.4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving: 
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed 
1TI.4.7	but refuse profane and old wives' fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness: 
1TI.4.8	for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come. 
1TI.4.9	Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation. 
1TI.4.10	For to this end we labour and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe. 
1TI.4.11	These things command and teach. 
1TI.4.12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity. 
1TI.4.13	Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. 
1TI.4.14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
1TI.4.15	Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all. 
1TI.4.16	Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.
1TI.5.1	Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren: 
1TI.5.2	the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honour widows that are widows indeed. 
1TI.5.4	But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to shew piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God. 
1TI.5.5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. 
1TI.5.6	But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth. 
1TI.5.7	These things also command, that they may be without reproach. 
1TI.5.8	But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever. 
1TI.5.9	Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, 
1TI.5.10	well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints' feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work. 
1TI.5.11	But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry; 
1TI.5.12	having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith. 
1TI.5.13	And withal they learn also 
1TI.5.14	I desire therefore that the younger 
1TI.5.15	for already some are turned aside after Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and in teaching. 
1TI.5.18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his hire. 
1TI.5.19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at 
1TI.5.20	Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear. 
1TI.5.21	I charge 
1TI.5.22	Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure. 
1TI.5.23	Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. 
1TI.5.24	Some men's sins are evident, going before unto judgement; and some men also they follow after. 
1TI.5.25	In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.
1TI.6.1	Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed. 
1TI.6.2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort. 
1TI.6.3	If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, 
1TI.6.4	he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 
1TI.6.5	wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is great gain: 
1TI.6.7	for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out; 
1TI.6.8	but having food and covering we shall be therewith content. 
1TI.6.9	But they that desire to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
1TI.6.11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
1TI.6.13	I charge thee in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession; 
1TI.6.14	that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
1TI.6.15	which in its own times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 
1TI.6.16	who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom 
1TI.6.17	Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 
1TI.6.18	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 
1TI.6.19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is 
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto 
1TI.6.21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 
2TI.1.2	to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day 
2TI.1.4	longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
2TI.1.5	having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.
2TI.1.6	For the which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands. 
2TI.1.7	For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline. 
2TI.1.8	Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God; 
2TI.1.9	who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 
2TI.1.10	but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel, 
2TI.1.11	whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher. 
2TI.1.12	For the which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day. 
2TI.1.13	Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	That good thing which was committed unto 
2TI.1.15	This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 
2TI.1.17	but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me 
2TI.1.18	(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2TI.2.1	Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	Suffer hardship with 
2TI.2.4	No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of 
2TI.2.5	And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully. 
2TI.2.6	The husbandman that laboureth must be the first to partake of the fruits. 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel: 
2TI.2.9	wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound. 
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
2TI.2.11	Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him: 
2TI.2.12	if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us: 
2TI.2.13	if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	Of these things put them in remembrance, charging 
2TI.2.15	Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, 
2TI.2.17	and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 
2TI.2.18	men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
2TI.2.19	Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness. 
2TI.2.20	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honour, and some unto dishonour. 
2TI.2.21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared unto every good work.
2TI.2.22	But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes. 
2TI.2.24	And the Lord's servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing, 
2TI.2.25	in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, 
2TI.2.26	and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by the Lord's servant unto the will of God.
2TI.3.1	But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come. 
2TI.3.2	For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 
2TI.3.4	traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 
2TI.3.5	holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away. 
2TI.3.6	For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, 
2TI.3.7	ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
2TI.3.8	And like as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2TI.3.9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.
2TI.3.10	But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, 
2TI.3.11	persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 
2TI.3.12	Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 
2TI.3.15	and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	Every scripture inspired of God 
2TI.3.17	that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.
2TI.4.1	I charge 
2TI.4.2	preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts; 
2TI.4.4	and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables. 
2TI.4.5	But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry. 
2TI.4.6	For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith: 
2TI.4.8	henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day: and not only to me, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 
2TI.4.10	for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is useful to me for ministering. 
2TI.4.12	But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments. 
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works: 
2TI.4.15	of whom be thou ware also; for he greatly withstood our words.
2TI.4.16	At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom 
2TI.4.19	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick. 
2TI.4.21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, 
TIT.1.2	in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal; 
TIT.1.3	but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 
TIT.1.4	to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
TIT.1.5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
TIT.1.6	if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly. 
TIT.1.7	For the bishop must be blameless, as God's steward; not selfwilled, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; 
TIT.1.8	but given to hospitality, a lover of good, soberminded, just, holy, temperate; 
TIT.1.9	holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers. 
TIT.1.10	For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, 
TIT.1.11	whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 
TIT.1.12	One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons. 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 
TIT.1.14	not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. 
TIT.1.16	They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
TIT.2.1	But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine: 
TIT.2.2	that aged men be temperate, grave, soberminded, sound in faith, in love, in patience: 
TIT.2.3	that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanour, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 
TIT.2.4	that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	 soberminded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed: 
TIT.2.6	the younger men likewise exhort to be soberminded: 
TIT.2.7	in all things shewing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine 
TIT.2.8	sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us. 
TIT.2.9	 servants to be in subjection to their own masters, 
TIT.2.10	not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 
TIT.2.12	instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world; 
TIT.2.13	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; 
TIT.2.14	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
TIT.2.15	These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
TIT.3.1	Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work, 
TIT.3.2	to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, shewing all meekness toward all men. 
TIT.3.3	For we also were aforetime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. 
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared, 
TIT.3.5	not by works 
TIT.3.6	which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
TIT.3.7	that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
TIT.3.8	Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I will that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they which have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
TIT.3.9	but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
TIT.3.10	A man that is heretical after a first and second admonition refuse; 
TIT.3.11	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned. 
TIT.3.12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter. 
TIT.3.13	Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
TIT.3.14	And let our 
TIT.3.15	All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker, 
PHM.1.2	and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house: 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
PHM.1.4	I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints; 
PHM.1.6	that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ. 
PHM.1.7	For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
PHM.1.8	Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting, 
PHM.1.9	yet for love's sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus: 
PHM.1.10	I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, 
PHM.1.11	who was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me: 
PHM.1.12	whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart: 
PHM.1.13	whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
PHM.1.14	but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will. 
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he was therefore parted 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
PHM.1.17	If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself. 
PHM.1.18	But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth 
PHM.1.19	I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee how that thou owest to me even thine own self besides. 
PHM.1.20	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ. 
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say. 
PHM.1.22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you. 
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee; 
PHM.1.24	 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers. 
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
HEB.1.1	God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, 
HEB.1.2	hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in 
HEB.1.3	who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
HEB.1.4	having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they. 
HEB.1.5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him a Father, And he shall be to me a Son? 
HEB.1.6	And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. 
HEB.1.7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels winds, And his ministers a flame of fire: 
HEB.1.8	but of the Son 
HEB.1.9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
HEB.1.10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of thy hands: 
HEB.1.11	They shall perish; but thou continuest: And they all shall wax old as doth a garment; 
HEB.1.12	And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up, As a garment, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, And thy years shall not fail. 
HEB.1.13	But of which of the angels hath he said at any time, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet? 
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?
HEB.2.1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away 
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; 
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard; 
HEB.2.4	God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.
HEB.2.5	For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak. 
HEB.2.6	But one hath somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
HEB.2.7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and honour, And didst set him over the works of thy hands: 
HEB.2.8	Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him. 
HEB.2.9	But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, 
HEB.2.10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
HEB.2.11	For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
HEB.2.12	saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise. 
HEB.2.13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God hath given me.
HEB.2.14	Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 
HEB.2.15	and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
HEB.2.16	For verily not of angels doth he take hold, but he taketh hold of the seed of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. 
HEB.2.18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, 
HEB.3.2	who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. 
HEB.3.3	For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honour than the house. 
HEB.3.4	For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God. 
HEB.3.5	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; 
HEB.3.6	but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
HEB.3.7	Wherefore, even as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye shall hear his voice, 
HEB.3.8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 
HEB.3.9	Wherewith your fathers tempted 
HEB.3.10	Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do alway err in their heart: But they did not know my ways; 
HEB.3.11	As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest. 
HEB.3.12	Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God: 
HEB.3.13	but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called Today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: 
HEB.3.14	for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end: 
HEB.3.15	while it is said, Today if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 
HEB.3.16	For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? 
HEB.3.17	And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? 
HEB.3.19	And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it. 
HEB.4.2	For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because they were not united by faith with them that heard. 
HEB.4.3	For we which have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For he hath said somewhere of the seventh 
HEB.4.5	and in this 
HEB.4.6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, 
HEB.4.7	he again defineth a certain day, saying in David, after so long a time, Today, as it hath been before said, Today if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts. 
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day. 
HEB.4.9	There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
HEB.4.11	Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience. 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 
HEB.4.14	Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 
HEB.4.15	For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as 
HEB.4.16	Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help 
HEB.5.1	For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: 
HEB.5.2	who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity; 
HEB.5.3	and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. 
HEB.5.4	And no man taketh the honour unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron. 
HEB.5.5	So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee: 
HEB.5.6	as he saith also in another 
HEB.5.7	Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, 
HEB.5.8	though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered; 
HEB.5.9	and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;
HEB.5.10	named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. 
HEB.5.11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing. 
HEB.5.12	For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food. 
HEB.5.13	For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for fullgrown men, 
HEB.6.1	Wherefore let us cease to speak of the first principles of Christ, and press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
HEB.6.2	of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement. 
HEB.6.3	And this will we do, if God permit. 
HEB.6.4	For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 
HEB.6.5	and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, 
HEB.6.6	and 
HEB.6.7	For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God: 
HEB.6.8	but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak: 
HEB.6.10	for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister. 
HEB.6.11	And we desire that each one of you may shew the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end: 
HEB.6.12	that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
HEB.6.13	For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself, 
HEB.6.14	saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. 
HEB.6.15	And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 
HEB.6.16	For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation. 
HEB.6.17	Wherein God, being minded to shew more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath: 
HEB.6.18	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us; 
HEB.6.19	which we have as an anchor of the soul, 
HEB.6.20	whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.7.1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, 
HEB.7.2	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 
HEB.7.3	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually. 
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils. 
HEB.7.5	And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest's office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: 
HEB.7.6	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises. 
HEB.7.7	But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better. 
HEB.7.8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 
HEB.7.9	And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes; 
HEB.7.10	for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
HEB.7.11	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need 
HEB.7.12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 
HEB.7.13	For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests. 
HEB.7.15	And 
HEB.7.16	who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life: 
HEB.7.17	for it is witnessed 
HEB.7.18	For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness 
HEB.7.19	(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God. 
HEB.7.20	And inasmuch as 
HEB.7.21	(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever); 
HEB.7.22	by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant. 
HEB.7.23	And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing: 
HEB.7.24	but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable. 
HEB.7.25	Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. 
HEB.7.26	For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
HEB.7.27	who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the 
HEB.7.28	For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, 
HEB.8.1	Now in the things which we are saying the chief point 
HEB.8.2	a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. 
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this 
HEB.8.4	Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law; 
HEB.8.5	who serve 
HEB.8.6	But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises. 
HEB.8.7	For if that first 
HEB.8.8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; 
HEB.8.9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord. 
HEB.8.10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people: 
HEB.8.11	And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them. 
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more. 
HEB.8.13	In that he saith, A new 
HEB.9.1	Now even the first 
HEB.9.2	For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein 
HEB.9.3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies; 
HEB.9.4	having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein 
HEB.9.5	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally. 
HEB.9.6	Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services; 
HEB.9.7	but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:
HEB.9.8	the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while as the first tabernacle is yet standing; 
HEB.9.9	which 
HEB.9.10	 only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation. 
HEB.9.11	But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, 
HEB.9.12	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption. 
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh: 
HEB.9.14	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
HEB.9.15	And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. 
HEB.9.16	For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it. 
HEB.9.17	For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for doth it ever avail while he that made it liveth? 
HEB.9.18	Wherefore even the first 
HEB.9.19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself, and all the people, 
HEB.9.20	saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward. 
HEB.9.21	Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood. 
HEB.9.22	And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
HEB.9.23	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us: 
HEB.9.25	nor yet that he should offer himself often; as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own; 
HEB.9.26	else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
HEB.9.27	And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this 
HEB.9.28	so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.
HEB.10.1	For the law having a shadow of the good 
HEB.10.2	Else would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more conscience of sins? 
HEB.10.3	But in those 
HEB.10.4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. 
HEB.10.5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me; 
HEB.10.6	In whole burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.7	Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me) To do thy will, O God. 
HEB.10.8	Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.9	then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. 
HEB.10.10	By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
HEB.10.11	And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins: 
HEB.10.12	but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; 
HEB.10.13	from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet. 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 
HEB.10.15	And the Holy Ghost also beareth witness to us: for after he hath said, 
HEB.10.16	This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; 
HEB.10.17	And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. 
HEB.10.18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
HEB.10.19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, 
HEB.10.20	by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
HEB.10.21	and 
HEB.10.22	let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed with pure water: 
HEB.10.23	let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised: 
HEB.10.24	and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works; 
HEB.10.25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting 
HEB.10.26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins, 
HEB.10.27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgement, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries. 
HEB.10.28	A man that hath set at nought Moses' law dieth without compassion on 
HEB.10.29	of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
HEB.10.30	For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. 
HEB.10.31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
HEB.10.32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings; 
HEB.10.33	partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used. 
HEB.10.34	For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that ye yourselves have a better possession and an abiding one. 
HEB.10.35	Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward. 
HEB.10.36	For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise. 
HEB.10.37	For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry. 
HEB.10.38	But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him. 
HEB.10.39	But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the assurance of 
HEB.11.2	For therein the elders had witness borne to them. 
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which do appear.
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh. 
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for before his translation he hath had witness borne to him that he had been well-pleasing unto God: 
HEB.11.6	And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing 
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, being warned 
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
HEB.11.9	By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a 
HEB.11.10	for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God. 
HEB.11.11	By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised: 
HEB.11.12	wherefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, 
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
HEB.11.14	For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own. 
HEB.11.15	And if indeed they had been mindful of that 
HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better 
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten 
HEB.11.18	 to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: 
HEB.11.19	accounting that God 
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come. 
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, 
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. 
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
HEB.11.25	choosing rather to be evil entreated with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
HEB.11.26	accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward. 
HEB.11.27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. 
HEB.11.29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up. 
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days. 
HEB.11.31	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
HEB.11.32	And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets: 
HEB.11.33	who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens. 
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: 
HEB.11.36	and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 
HEB.11.37	they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, evil entreated 
HEB.11.38	(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth. 
HEB.11.39	And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise, 
HEB.11.40	God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 
HEB.12.2	looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of 
HEB.12.3	For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against themselves, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.
HEB.12.4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin: 
HEB.12.5	and ye have forgotten the exhortation, which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when thou art reproved of him; 
HEB.12.6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. 
HEB.12.7	It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom 
HEB.12.8	But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. 
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? 
HEB.12.10	For they verily for a few days chastened 
HEB.12.11	All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous, but grievous: yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, 
HEB.12.12	Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees; 
HEB.12.13	and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed. 
HEB.12.14	Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord: 
HEB.12.15	looking carefully lest 
HEB.12.16	lest 
HEB.12.17	For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected (for he found no place of repentance), though he sought it diligently with tears.
HEB.12.18	For ye are not come unto 
HEB.12.19	and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which 
HEB.12.20	for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned; 
HEB.12.21	and so fearful was the appearance, 
HEB.12.22	but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels, 
HEB.12.23	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, 
HEB.12.24	and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than 
HEB.12.25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not, when they refused him that warned 
HEB.12.26	whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven. 
HEB.12.27	And this 
HEB.12.28	Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe: 
HEB.12.29	for our God is a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let love of the brethren continue. 
HEB.13.2	Forget not to shew love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 
HEB.13.3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are evil entreated, as being yourselves also in the body. 
HEB.13.4	 marriage 
HEB.13.5	Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee. 
HEB.13.6	So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me? 
HEB.13.7	Remember them that had the rule over you, which spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith. 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ 
HEB.13.9	Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be stablished by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited. 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest 
HEB.13.12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate. 
HEB.13.13	Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 
HEB.13.14	For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after 
HEB.13.15	Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name. 
HEB.13.16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. 
HEB.13.17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit 
HEB.13.18	Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honestly in all things. 
HEB.13.19	And I exhort 
HEB.13.20	Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of the eternal covenant, 
HEB.13.21	make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom 
HEB.13.22	But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words. 
HEB.13.23	Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 
HEB.13.24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all. Amen.
JAS.1.1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.
JAS.1.2	Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations; 
JAS.1.3	Knowing that the proof of your faith worketh patience. 
JAS.1.4	And let patience have 
JAS.1.5	But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed. 
JAS.1.7	For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord; 
JAS.1.8	a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways. 
JAS.1.9	But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate: 
JAS.1.10	and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. 
JAS.1.11	For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings. 
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which 
JAS.1.13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man: 
JAS.1.14	but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed. 
JAS.1.15	Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death. 
JAS.1.16	Be not deceived, my beloved brethren. 
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning. 
JAS.1.18	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
JAS.1.19	Ye know 
JAS.1.20	for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. 
JAS.1.21	Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 
JAS.1.22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves. 
JAS.1.23	For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: 
JAS.1.24	for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
JAS.1.25	But he that looketh into the perfect law, the 
JAS.1.26	If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man's religion is vain. 
JAS.1.27	Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
JAS.2.1	My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
JAS.2.2	For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing; 
JAS.2.3	and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool; 
JAS.2.4	are ye not divided in your own mind, and become judges with evil thoughts? 
JAS.2.5	Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world 
JAS.2.6	But ye have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgement-seats? 
JAS.2.7	Do not they blaspheme the honourable name by the which ye are called?
JAS.2.8	Howbeit if ye fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 
JAS.2.9	but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. 
JAS.2.10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one 
JAS.2.11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 
JAS.2.12	So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty. 
JAS.2.13	For judgement 
JAS.2.14	What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him? 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister be naked, and in lack of daily food, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit? 
JAS.2.17	Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself. 
JAS.2.18	Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith apart from 
JAS.2.19	Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and shudder. 
JAS.2.20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren? 
JAS.2.21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? 
JAS.2.22	Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect; 
JAS.2.23	and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God. 
JAS.2.24	Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith. 
JAS.2.25	And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? 
JAS.2.26	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
JAS.3.1	Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgement. 
JAS.3.2	For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. 
JAS.3.3	Now if we put the horses' bridles into their mouths, that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also. 
JAS.3.4	Behold, the ships also, though they are so great, and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth. 
JAS.3.5	So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire! 
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell. 
JAS.3.7	For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind: 
JAS.3.8	but the tongue can no man tame; 
JAS.3.9	Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the likeness of God: 
JAS.3.10	out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 
JAS.3.11	Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet 
JAS.3.12	Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither 
JAS.3.13	Who is wise and understanding among you? let him shew by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth. 
JAS.3.15	This wisdom is not 
JAS.3.16	For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy. 
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.
JAS.4.1	Whence 
JAS.4.2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not. 
JAS.4.3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend 
JAS.4.4	Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? 
JAS.4.6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore 
JAS.4.7	Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded. 
JAS.4.9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.
JAS.4.11	Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
JAS.4.12	One 
JAS.4.13	Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain: 
JAS.4.14	whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 
JAS.4.15	For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that. 
JAS.4.16	But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil. 
JAS.4.17	To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
JAS.5.1	Go to now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you. 
JAS.5.2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days. 
JAS.5.4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. 
JAS.5.5	Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous 
JAS.5.7	Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain. 
JAS.5.8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand. 
JAS.5.9	Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors. 
JAS.5.10	Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	Behold, we call them blessed which endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.
JAS.5.12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgement. 
JAS.5.13	Is any among you suffering? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing praise. 
JAS.5.14	Is any among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 
JAS.5.15	and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him. 
JAS.5.16	Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working. 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months. 
JAS.5.18	And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. 
JAS.5.19	My brethren, if any among you do err from the truth, and one convert him; 
JAS.5.20	let him know, that he which converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
1PE.1.2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
1PE.1.3	Blessed 
1PE.1.4	unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 
1PE.1.5	who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1PE.1.6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold temptations, 
1PE.1.7	that the proof of your faith, 
1PE.1.8	whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory: 
1PE.1.9	receiving the end of your faith, 
1PE.1.10	Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that 
1PE.1.11	searching what 
1PE.1.12	To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.
1PE.1.13	Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
1PE.1.14	as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in 
1PE.1.15	but like as he which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; 
1PE.1.16	because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy. 
1PE.1.17	And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man's work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear: 
1PE.1.18	knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers; 
1PE.1.19	but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, 
1PE.1.20	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake, 
1PE.1.21	who through him are believers in God, which raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God. 
1PE.1.22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently: 
1PE.1.23	having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.
1PE.1.24	For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth: 
1PE.1.25	But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.
1PE.2.1	Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, 
1PE.2.2	as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation; 
1PE.2.3	if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
1PE.2.4	unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, 
1PE.2.5	ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. 
1PE.2.7	For you therefore which believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; 
1PE.2.8	and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. 
1PE.2.9	But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for 
1PE.2.10	which in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 
1PE.2.11	Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
1PE.2.12	having your behaviour seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
1PE.2.13	Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
1PE.2.14	or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well. 
1PE.2.15	For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
1PE.2.16	as free, and not using your freedom for a cloke of wickedness, but as bondservants of God. 
1PE.2.17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. 
1PE.2.18	Servants, 
1PE.2.19	For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully. 
1PE.2.20	For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted 
1PE.2.21	For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
1PE.2.22	who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
1PE.2.23	who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed 
1PE.2.24	who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. 
1PE.2.25	For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1PE.3.1	In like manner, ye wives, 
1PE.3.2	beholding your chaste behaviour 
1PE.3.3	Whose 
1PE.3.4	but 
1PE.3.5	For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: 
1PE.3.6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. 
1PE.3.7	Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with 
1PE.3.8	Finally, 
1PE.3.9	not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing. 
1PE.3.10	For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile: 
1PE.3.11	And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it. 
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil. 
1PE.3.13	And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good? 
1PE.3.14	But and if ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed 
1PE.3.15	but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: 
1PE.3.16	having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
1PE.3.18	Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit; 
1PE.3.19	in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, 
1PE.3.20	which aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
1PE.3.21	which also after a true likeness doth now save you, 
1PE.3.22	who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
1PE.4.1	Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
1PE.4.2	that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 
1PE.4.3	For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries:
1PE.4.4	wherein they think it strange that ye run not with 
1PE.4.5	who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
1PE.4.7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer: 
1PE.4.8	above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins: 
1PE.4.9	using hospitality one to another without murmuring: 
1PE.4.10	according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God; 
1PE.4.11	if any man speaketh, 
1PE.4.12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you: 
1PE.4.13	but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy. 
1PE.4.14	If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed 
1PE.4.15	For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men's matters: 
1PE.4.16	but if 
1PE.4.17	For the time 
1PE.4.18	And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear? 
1PE.4.19	Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.
1PE.5.1	The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 
1PE.5.2	Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according unto God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 
1PE.5.3	neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock. 
1PE.5.4	And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
1PE.5.5	Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. 
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; 
1PE.5.7	casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.
1PE.5.8	Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
1PE.5.9	whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
1PE.5.10	And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you. 
1PE.5.11	To him 
1PE.5.12	By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account 
1PE.5.13	She that is in Babylon, elect together with 
1PE.5.14	Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ: 
2PE.1.2	Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; 
2PE.1.3	seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue; 
2PE.1.4	whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.
2PE.1.5	Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in 
2PE.1.6	and in 
2PE.1.7	and in 
2PE.1.8	For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2PE.1.9	For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins. 
2PE.1.10	Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble: 
2PE.1.11	for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with 
2PE.1.13	And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; 
2PE.1.14	knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me. 
2PE.1.15	Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
2PE.1.17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: 
2PE.1.18	and this voice we 
2PE.1.19	And we have the word of prophecy 
2PE.1.20	knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation. 
2PE.1.21	For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Ghost.
2PE.2.1	But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. 
2PE.2.2	And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.
2PE.2.3	And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not. 
2PE.2.4	For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgement; 
2PE.2.5	and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
2PE.2.6	and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;
2PE.2.7	and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked 
2PE.2.8	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed 
2PE.2.9	the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgement;
2PE.2.10	but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, selfwilled, they tremble not to rail at dignities: 
2PE.2.11	whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgement against them before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed, 
2PE.2.13	suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; 
2PE.2.14	having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing; 
2PE.2.15	forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the 
2PE.2.16	but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man's voice and stayed the madness of the prophet. 
2PE.2.17	These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. 
2PE.2.18	For, uttering great swelling 
2PE.2.19	promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage. 
2PE.2.20	For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first. 
2PE.2.21	For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them. 
2PE.2.22	It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.
2PE.3.1	This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance; 
2PE.3.2	that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles:
2PE.3.3	knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts, 
2PE.3.4	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. 
2PE.3.5	For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God; 
2PE.3.6	by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 
2PE.3.7	but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly men.
2PE.3.8	But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
2PE.3.11	Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in 
2PE.3.12	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 
2PE.3.13	But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 
2PE.3.14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight. 
2PE.3.15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you; 
2PE.3.16	as also in all 
2PE.3.17	Ye therefore, beloved, knowing 
2PE.3.18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him 
1JN.1.1	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life 
1JN.1.2	(and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, the eternal 
1JN.1.3	that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: 
1JN.1.4	and these things we write, that our joy may be fulfilled.
1JN.1.5	And this is the message which we have heard from him, and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 
1JN.1.7	but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 
1JN.2.2	and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
1JN.2.3	And hereby know we that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 
1JN.2.4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him: 
1JN.2.5	but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him: 
1JN.2.6	he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
1JN.2.7	Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard. 
1JN.2.8	Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth. 
1JN.2.9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now. 
1JN.2.10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 
1JN.2.11	But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I write unto you, 
1JN.2.13	I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him which is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father. 
1JN.2.14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him which is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one. 
1JN.2.15	Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
1JN.2.16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 
1JN.2.17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
1JN.2.18	Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour. 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but 
1JN.2.20	And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 
1JN.2.21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, 
1JN.2.23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also. 
1JN.2.24	As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise which he promised us, 
1JN.2.26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray. 
1JN.2.27	And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him.
1JN.2.28	And now, 
1JN.2.29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him.
1JN.3.1	Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God: and 
1JN.3.2	Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. 
1JN.3.3	And every one that hath this hope 
1JN.3.4	Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness: and sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin. 
1JN.3.6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him. 
1JN.3.7	 little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: 
1JN.3.8	he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
1JN.3.9	Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. 
1JN.3.10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: 
1JN.3.12	not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 
1JN.3.13	Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death. 
1JN.3.15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
1JN.3.16	Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
1JN.3.17	But whoso hath the world's goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? 
1JN.3.18	 little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. 
1JN.3.19	Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him,
1JN.3.20	whereinsoever our heart condemn us; because God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; 
1JN.3.22	and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
1JN.3.23	And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. 
1JN.3.24	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
1JN.4.1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
1JN.4.3	and every spirit which confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the 
1JN.4.4	Ye are of God, 
1JN.4.5	They are of the world: therefore speak they 
1JN.4.6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God. 
1JN.4.8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
1JN.4.10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: 
1JN.4.13	hereby know we that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
1JN.4.14	And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son 
1JN.4.15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. 
1JN.4.16	And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.
1JN.4.17	Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgement; because as he is, even so are we in this world. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love. 
1JN.4.19	We love, because he first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen. 
1JN.4.21	And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.
1JN.5.1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 
1JN.5.2	Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and do his commandments. 
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 
1JN.5.4	For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, 
1JN.5.5	And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN.5.6	This is he that came by water and blood, 
1JN.5.7	And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.8	For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one. 
1JN.5.9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.
1JN.5.10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son. 
1JN.5.11	And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life. 
1JN.5.13	These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, 
1JN.5.14	And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: 
1JN.5.15	and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. 
1JN.5.16	If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1JN.5.18	We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth him, and the evil one toucheth him not. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one. 
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, 
1JN.5.21	 little children, guard yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth; 
2JN.1.2	for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever: 
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
2JN.1.4	I rejoice greatly that I have found 
2JN.1.5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
2JN.1.6	And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, 
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward. 
2JN.1.9	Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.
2JN.1.10	If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into 
2JN.1.11	for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.
2JN.1.12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not 
2JN.1.13	The children of thine elect sister salute thee.
3JN.1.1	The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth. 
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3JN.1.3	For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth. 
3JN.1.4	Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth. 
3JN.1.5	Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal; 
3JN.1.6	who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God: 
3JN.1.7	because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. 
3JN.1.8	We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. 
3JN.1.10	Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth, and casteth 
3JN.1.11	Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
3JN.1.12	Demetrius hath the witness of all 
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write 
3JN.1.14	but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace 
JUD.1.1	Judas, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ: 
JUD.1.2	Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints. 
JUD.1.4	For there are certain men crept in privily, 
JUD.1.5	Now I desire to put you in remembrance, though ye know all things once for all, how that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 
JUD.1.6	And angels which kept not their own principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgement of the great day. 
JUD.1.7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication, and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	Yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and rail at dignities. 
JUD.1.9	But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing judgement, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. 
JUD.1.10	But these rail at whatsoever things they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in these things are they destroyed. 
JUD.1.11	Woe unto them! for they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. 
JUD.1.12	These are they who are hidden rocks in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 
JUD.1.13	Wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever. 
JUD.1.14	And to these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
JUD.1.15	to execute judgement upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. 
JUD.1.16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling 
JUD.1.17	But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
JUD.1.18	how that they said to you, In the last time there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts. 
JUD.1.19	These are they who make separations, sensual, having not the Spirit. 
JUD.1.20	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, 
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 
JUD.1.22	And on some have mercy, who are in doubt; 
JUD.1.23	and some save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. 
JUD.1.24	Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy, 
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, 
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to shew unto his servants, 
REV.1.2	who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, 
REV.1.3	Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. 
REV.1.4	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him which is and which was and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ, 
REV.1.6	and he made us 
REV.1.7	Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they which pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen. 
REV.1.8	I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty.
REV.1.9	I John, your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patience 
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet 
REV.1.11	saying, What thou seest, write in a book, and send 
REV.1.12	And I turned to see the voice which spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
REV.1.13	and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle. 
REV.1.14	And his head and his hair were white as white wool, 
REV.1.15	and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters. 
REV.1.16	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 
REV.1.17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, 
REV.1.18	and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. 
REV.1.19	Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter; 
REV.1.20	the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.
REV.2.1	To the angel of the church in Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks: 
REV.2.2	I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them which call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false; 
REV.2.3	and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. 
REV.2.4	But I have 
REV.2.5	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. 
REV.2.6	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
REV.2.7	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.
REV.2.8	And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and lived 
REV.2.9	I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 
REV.2.10	Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. 
REV.2.11	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
REV.2.12	And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write; These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword: 
REV.2.13	I know where thou dwellest, 
REV.2.14	But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication. 
REV.2.15	So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner. 
REV.2.16	Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth. 
REV.2.17	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.
REV.2.18	And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass: 
REV.2.19	I know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy last works are more than the first. 
REV.2.20	But I have 
REV.2.21	And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication. 
REV.2.22	Behold, I do cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works. 
REV.2.23	And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works. 
REV.2.24	But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, which know not the deep things of Satan, as they say; I cast upon you none other burden. 
REV.2.25	Howbeit that which ye have, hold fast till I come. 
REV.2.26	And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations: 
REV.2.27	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father: 
REV.2.28	and I will give him the morning star. 
REV.2.29	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV.3.1	And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead. 
REV.3.2	Be thou watchful, and stablish the things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine fulfilled before my God. 
REV.3.3	Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear; and keep 
REV.3.4	But thou hast a few names in Sardis which did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy. 
REV.3.5	He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. 
REV.3.6	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV.3.7	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and none shall shut, and that shutteth, and none openeth: 
REV.3.8	I know thy works (behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name. 
REV.3.9	Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them which say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. 
REV.3.10	Because thou didst keep the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, that 
REV.3.11	I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown. 
REV.3.12	He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and mine own new name. 
REV.3.13	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV.3.14	And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God: 
REV.3.15	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. 
REV.3.16	So because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth. 
REV.3.17	Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked: 
REV.3.18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayest become rich; and white garments, that thou mayest clothe thyself, and 
REV.3.19	As many as I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. 
REV.3.21	He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne. 
REV.3.22	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV.4.1	After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, 
REV.4.2	Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne; 
REV.4.3	and he that sat 
REV.4.4	And round about the throne 
REV.4.5	And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And 
REV.4.6	and before the throne, as it were a glassy sea like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. 
REV.4.7	And the first creature 
REV.4.8	And the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, 
REV.4.9	And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
REV.4.11	Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honour and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.
REV.5.1	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 
REV.5.3	And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon. 
REV.5.4	And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon: 
REV.5.5	and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome, to open the book and the seven seals thereof.
REV.5.6	And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. 
REV.5.7	And he came, and he taketh 
REV.5.8	And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 
REV.5.9	And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood 
REV.5.10	and madest them 
REV.5.11	And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
REV.5.12	saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honour, and glory, and blessing. 
REV.5.13	And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them, heard I saying, Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, 
REV.5.14	And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
REV.6.1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come. 
REV.6.2	And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.
REV.6.3	And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. 
REV.6.4	And another 
REV.6.5	And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. 
REV.6.6	And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny; and the oil and the wine hurt thou not. 
REV.6.7	And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. 
REV.6.8	And I saw, and behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 
REV.6.10	and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 
REV.6.11	And there was given them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, which should be killed even as they were, should be fulfilled. 
REV.6.12	And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood; 
REV.6.13	and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs, when she is shaken of a great wind. 
REV.6.14	And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 
REV.6.15	And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; 
REV.6.16	and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 
REV.6.17	for the great day of their wrath is come; and who is able to stand?
REV.7.1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree. 
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
REV.7.3	saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. 
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel. 
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Judah 
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand: 
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand: 
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Benjamin 
REV.7.9	After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of 
REV.7.10	and they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God which sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb. 
REV.7.11	And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and 
REV.7.12	saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, 
REV.7.13	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These which are arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and whence came they? 
REV.7.14	And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them. 
REV.7.16	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat: 
REV.7.17	for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.
REV.8.1	And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels which stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets. 
REV.8.3	And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. 
REV.8.5	And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 
REV.8.6	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
REV.8.7	And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. 
REV.8.8	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; 
REV.8.9	and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, 
REV.8.10	And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; 
REV.8.11	and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. 
REV.8.12	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner. 
REV.8.13	And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.
REV.9.1	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss. 
REV.9.2	And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 
REV.9.3	And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 
REV.9.4	And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man. 
REV.9.6	And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them. 
REV.9.7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men's faces. 
REV.9.8	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as 
REV.9.9	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war. 
REV.9.10	And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months. 
REV.9.11	They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek 
REV.9.12	The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.
REV.9.13	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God, 
REV.9.14	one saying to the sixth angel, which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates. 
REV.9.15	And the four angels were loosed, which had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men. 
REV.9.16	And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them. 
REV.9.17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates 
REV.9.18	By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they do hurt. 
REV.9.20	And the rest of mankind, which were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk: 
REV.9.21	and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire; 
REV.10.2	and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth; 
REV.10.3	and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders uttered 
REV.10.5	And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven, 
REV.10.6	and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there shall be time no longer: 
REV.10.7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.
REV.10.8	And the voice which I heard from heaven, 
REV.10.9	And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey. 
REV.10.10	And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter. 
REV.10.11	And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
REV.11.1	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. 
REV.11.2	And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.
REV.11.3	And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. 
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth. 
REV.11.5	And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed. 
REV.11.6	These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire. 
REV.11.7	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them. 
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies 
REV.11.9	And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do 
REV.11.10	And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth. 
REV.11.11	And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which beheld them. 
REV.11.12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 
REV.11.13	And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly. 
REV.11.15	And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become 
REV.11.16	And the four and twenty elders, which sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, 
REV.11.17	saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, which art and which wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign. 
REV.11.18	And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and 
REV.11.19	And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.
REV.12.1	And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; 
REV.12.2	and she was with child: and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered. 
REV.12.3	And there was seen another sign in heaven; and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems. 
REV.12.4	And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was about to be delivered, that when she was delivered he might devour her child. 
REV.12.5	And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne. 
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 
REV.12.7	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels 
REV.12.8	And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. 
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him. 
REV.12.10	And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accuseth them before our God day and night. 
REV.12.11	And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time. 
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man 
REV.12.14	And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. 
REV.12.15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream. 
REV.12.16	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus:
REV.13.1	and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy. 
REV.13.2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as 
REV.13.3	And 
REV.13.4	and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? and who is able to war with him? 
REV.13.5	and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months. 
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, 
REV.13.7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. 
REV.13.8	And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, 
REV.13.9	If any man hath an ear, let him hear. 
REV.13.10	If any man 
REV.13.11	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
REV.13.12	And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed. 
REV.13.13	And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men. 
REV.13.14	And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, who hath the stroke of the sword, and lived. 
REV.13.15	And it was given 
REV.13.16	And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead; 
REV.13.17	and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.
REV.14.1	And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard 
REV.14.3	and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, 
REV.14.4	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These 
REV.14.5	And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; 
REV.14.7	and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgement is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. 
REV.14.8	And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 
REV.14.9	And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, 
REV.14.10	he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 
REV.14.11	and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. 
REV.14.12	Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them. 
REV.14.14	And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud 
REV.14.15	And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is over-ripe. 
REV.14.16	And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped. 
REV.14.17	And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. 
REV.14.19	And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great 
REV.14.20	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
REV.15.1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having seven plagues, 
REV.15.2	And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire; and them that come victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the glassy sea, having harps of God. 
REV.15.3	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages. 
REV.15.4	Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.
REV.15.5	And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 
REV.15.6	and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with 
REV.15.7	And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.
REV.16.1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth. 
REV.16.2	And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and which worshipped his image. 
REV.16.3	And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, 
REV.16.4	And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood. 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, which art and which wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge: 
REV.16.6	for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy. 
REV.16.7	And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgements.
REV.16.8	And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire. 
REV.16.9	And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of the God which hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory. 
REV.16.10	And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 
REV.16.11	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.
REV.16.12	And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the 
REV.16.13	And I saw 
REV.16.14	for they are spirits of devils, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. 
REV.16.15	(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.) 
REV.16.16	And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.
REV.16.17	And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done: 
REV.16.18	and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. 
REV.16.19	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 
REV.16.20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 
REV.16.21	And great hail, 
REV.17.1	And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the judgement of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters; 
REV.17.2	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication. 
REV.17.3	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication, 
REV.17.5	and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.
REV.17.7	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. 
REV.17.8	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, 
REV.17.9	Here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth: 
REV.17.10	and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while. 
REV.17.11	And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition. 
REV.17.12	And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour. 
REV.17.13	These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.
REV.17.14	These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they 
REV.17.15	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished. 
REV.17.18	And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
REV.18.1	After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 
REV.18.2	And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of devils, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird. 
REV.18.3	For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness. 
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: 
REV.18.5	for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 
REV.18.6	Render unto her even as she rendered, and double 
REV.18.7	How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning. 
REV.18.8	Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God which judged her.
REV.18.9	And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning, 
REV.18.10	standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgement come. 
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more; 
REV.18.12	merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; 
REV.18.13	and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and 
REV.18.14	And the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee, and 
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning; 
REV.18.16	saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl! 
REV.18.17	for in one hour so great riches is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any whither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off, 
REV.18.18	and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying, What 
REV.18.19	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein were made rich all that had their ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. 
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgement on her. 
REV.18.21	And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all. 
REV.18.22	And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the voice of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; 
REV.18.23	and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived. 
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.
REV.19.1	After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God: 
REV.19.2	for true and righteous are his judgements; for he hath judged the great harlot, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. 
REV.19.3	And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever. 
REV.19.4	And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.
REV.19.5	And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and the great. 
REV.19.6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth. 
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 
REV.19.8	And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright 
REV.19.9	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God. 
REV.19.10	And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
REV.19.11	And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon, called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. 
REV.19.12	And his eyes 
REV.19.13	And he 
REV.19.14	And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white 
REV.19.15	And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. 
REV.19.16	And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND 
REV.19.17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven, Come 
REV.19.18	that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great. 
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army. 
REV.19.20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image: they twain were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone: 
REV.19.21	and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, 
REV.20.1	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 
REV.20.2	And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 
REV.20.3	and cast him into the abyss, and shut 
REV.20.4	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgement was given unto them: and 
REV.20.5	The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 
REV.20.8	and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 
REV.20.9	And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them. 
REV.20.10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 
REV.20.14	And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, 
REV.20.15	And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more. 
REV.21.2	And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. 
REV.21.3	And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, 
REV.21.4	and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away. 
REV.21.5	And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true. 
REV.21.6	And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. 
REV.21.7	He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. 
REV.21.8	But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part 
REV.21.9	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb. 
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
REV.21.11	having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal: 
REV.21.12	having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are 
REV.21.13	on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
REV.21.15	And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. 
REV.21.16	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal. 
REV.21.17	And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, 
REV.21.18	And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
REV.21.20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. 
REV.21.22	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof. 
REV.21.23	And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof 
REV.21.24	And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory into it. 
REV.21.25	And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there): 
REV.21.26	and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it: 
REV.21.27	and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
REV.22.1	And he shewed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, 
REV.22.2	in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve 
REV.22.3	And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall do him service; 
REV.22.4	and they shall see his face; and his name 
REV.22.5	And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.22.6	And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass. 
REV.22.7	And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. 
REV.22.8	And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 
REV.22.9	And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them which keep the words of this book: worship God. 
REV.22.10	And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand. 
REV.22.11	He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still. 
REV.22.12	Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is. 
REV.22.13	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. 
REV.22.14	Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right 
REV.22.15	Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie. 
REV.22.16	I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star. 
REV.22.17	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely. 
REV.22.18	I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book: 
REV.22.19	and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
REV.22.20	He which testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus. 
REV.22.21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
