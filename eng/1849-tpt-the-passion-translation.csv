PSA.1.1	What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways!
PSA.1.1	He won’t walk in step with the wicked,
PSA.1.1	nor share the sinner’s way,
PSA.1.1	nor be found sitting in the scorner’s seat.
PSA.1.2	His pleasure and passion is remaining true to the Word of “I Am,”
PSA.1.2	meditating day and night in the true revelation of light.
PSA.1.3	He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree
PSA.1.3	planted by God’s design,
PSA.1.3	deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss,
PSA.1.3	bearing fruit in every season of his life.
PSA.1.3	He is never dry, never fainting,
PSA.1.3	ever blessed, ever prosperous.
PSA.1.4	But how different are the wicked.
PSA.1.4	All they are is dust in the wind—
PSA.1.4	driven away to destruction!
PSA.1.5	The wicked will not endure the day of judgment,
PSA.1.5	for God will not defend them.
PSA.1.5	Nothing they do will succeed or endure for long,
PSA.1.5	for they have no part with those who walk in truth.
PSA.1.6	But how different it is for the righteous!
PSA.1.6	The Lord embraces their paths as they move forward
PSA.1.6	while the way of the wicked leads only to doom.
PSA.2.1	How dare the nations plan a rebellion.
PSA.2.1	Their foolish plots are futile!
PSA.2.2	Look at how the power brokers of the world
PSA.2.2	rise up to hold their summit
PSA.2.2	as the rulers scheme and confer together
PSA.2.2	against Yahweh and his Anointed King, saying:
PSA.2.3	“Let’s come together and break away from the Creator.
PSA.2.3	Once and for all let’s cast off these controlling chains
PSA.2.3	of God and his Christ!”
PSA.2.4	God-Enthroned merely laughs at them;
PSA.2.4	the Sovereign One mocks their madness!
PSA.2.5	Then with the fierceness of his fiery anger
PSA.2.5	he settles the issue and terrifies them to death with these words:
PSA.2.6	“I myself have poured out my King on Zion, my holy mountain.
PSA.2.7	“I will reveal the eternal purpose of God.
PSA.2.7	For he has decreed over me, ‘You are my favored Son.
PSA.2.7	And as your Father I have crowned you as my King Eternal.
PSA.2.7	Today I became your Father.
PSA.2.8	Ask me to give you the nations and I will do it,
PSA.2.8	and they shall become your legacy.
PSA.2.8	Your domain will stretch to the ends of the earth.
PSA.2.9	And you will shepherd them with unlimited authority,
PSA.2.9	crushing their rebellion as an iron rod smashes jars of clay!’ ”
PSA.2.10	Listen to me, all you rebel-kings
PSA.2.10	and all you upstart judges of the earth.
PSA.2.10	Learn your lesson 
PSA.2.11	Serve and worship the awe-inspiring God.
PSA.2.11	Recognize his greatness and bow before him,
PSA.2.11	trembling with reverence in his presence.
PSA.2.12	Fall facedown before him and kiss the Son
PSA.2.12	before his anger is roused against you.
PSA.2.12	Remember that his wrath can be quickly kindled!
PSA.2.12	But many blessings are waiting for all
PSA.2.12	who turn aside to hide themselves in him!
PSA.3.1	Lord, I have so many enemies, so many who are against me.
PSA.3.2	Listen to how they whisper their slander against me, saying:
PSA.3.2	“Look! He’s hopeless! Even God can’t save him from this!”
PSA.3.2	Pause in his presence
PSA.3.3	But 
PSA.3.3	that you, Yahweh, have become my Shield;
PSA.3.3	You take me and surround me with yourself.
PSA.3.3	Your glory covers me continually.
PSA.3.3	You lift high my head when I bow low in shame.
PSA.3.4	I have cried out to you, Yahweh, from your holy presence.
PSA.3.4	You send me a Father’s help.
PSA.3.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.3.5	So now I’ll lie down and sleep like a baby—
PSA.3.5	then I’ll awake in safety, for you surround me with your glory.
PSA.3.6	Even though dark powers prowl around me,
PSA.3.6	I won’t be afraid.
PSA.3.7	:
PSA.3.7	“Rise up and help me, Lord! Come and save me!”
PSA.3.7	And you will slap them in the face,
PSA.3.7	breaking the power of their words to harm me.
PSA.3.8	,
PSA.3.8	for the Lord alone is my Savior.
PSA.3.8	What a feast of favor and bliss he gives his people!
PSA.3.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.4.1	God, you are my righteousness, my champion defender.
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I cry for help!
PSA.4.1	Whenever I was in distress, you enlarged me.
PSA.4.1	I’m being squeezed again—I need your kindness right away!
PSA.4.1	Grant me your grace, hear my prayer, and set me free!
PSA.4.2	Listen to me, you elite among men:
PSA.4.2	How long will you defame my honor
PSA.4.2	and drag it down into shame?
PSA.4.2	Will you ever stop insulting me?
PSA.4.2	How long will you set your heart on shadows,
PSA.4.2	chasing your lies and delusions?
PSA.4.2	Pause in his presence
PSA.4.3	May we never forget that the Lord works wonders
PSA.4.3	for every one of his devoted lovers.
PSA.4.3	And this is how I know that he will answer my every prayer.
PSA.4.4	Tremble in awe before the Lord, and do not sin against him.
PSA.4.4	Be still upon your bed and search your heart before him.
PSA.4.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.4.5	Bring to Yahweh the sacrifice of righteousness and put your trust in him.
PSA.4.6	Lord, prove them wrong when they say, “God can’t help you!”
PSA.4.6	Let the light of your radiant face
PSA.4.6	break through and shine upon us!
PSA.4.7	The intense pleasure you give me
PSA.4.7	surpasses the gladness of harvest time,
PSA.4.7	even more than when the harvesters
PSA.4.7	gaze upon their ripened grain
PSA.4.7	and when their new wine overflows.
PSA.4.8	Now, because of you, Lord, I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once,
PSA.4.8	for no matter what happens, I will live unafraid!
PSA.5.1	Listen, Yahweh, to my passionate prayer!
PSA.5.1	Can’t you hear my groaning?
PSA.5.2	Don’t you hear how I’m crying out to you?
PSA.5.2	My King and my God, consider my every word,
PSA.5.2	for I am calling out to you.
PSA.5.3	At each and every sunrise you will hear my voice
PSA.5.3	as I prepare my 
PSA.5.3	Every morning I lay out the pieces of my life on the altar
PSA.5.3	and wait 
PSA.5.4	I know that you, God, are never pleased with lawlessness,
PSA.5.4	and evil ones will never be invited as guests in your house.
PSA.5.5	Boasters collapse, unable to survive your scrutiny,
PSA.5.5	for your hatred of evildoers is clear.
PSA.5.6	You will make an end of all those who lie.
PSA.5.6	How you hate their hypocrisy and despise all who love violence!
PSA.5.7	But I know that you will welcome me into your house,
PSA.5.7	for I am covered by your covenant of mercy and love.
PSA.5.7	So I come to your sanctuary with deepest awe
PSA.5.7	to bow in worship and adore you.
PSA.5.8	Yahweh, lead me in the pathways of your pleasure
PSA.5.8	just like you promised me you would,
PSA.5.8	or else my enemies will conquer me.
PSA.5.8	Smooth out your road in front of me,
PSA.5.8	straight and level so that I will know where to walk.
PSA.5.9	Their words are unreliable.
PSA.5.9	Destruction is in their hearts,
PSA.5.9	drawing people into their darkness with their speeches.
PSA.5.9	They are smooth-tongued deceivers, flattering with their words.
PSA.5.10	Declare them guilty, O God!
PSA.5.10	Let their own schemes be their downfall!
PSA.5.10	Let the guilt of their sins collapse on top of them,
PSA.5.10	for they rebel against you.
PSA.5.11	But let them all be glad,
PSA.5.11	those who turn aside to hide themselves in you.
PSA.5.11	May they keep shouting for joy forever!
PSA.5.11	Overshadow them in your presence as they sing and rejoice.
PSA.5.11	Then every lover of your name will burst forth with endless joy.
PSA.5.12	Lord, how wonderfully you bless the righteous.
PSA.5.12	Your favor wraps around each one and covers them
PSA.5.12	under your canopy of kindness and joy.
PSA.6.1	No, Lord! Don’t condemn me.
PSA.6.1	Don’t punish me in your fiery anger.
PSA.6.2	Please deal gently with me, Yahweh;
PSA.6.2	show me mercy, for I’m sick and frail.
PSA.6.2	I’m fading away with weakness.
PSA.6.2	Heal me, for I’m falling apart.
PSA.6.3	How long until you take away this pain in my body and in my soul?
PSA.6.3	Lord, I’m trembling in fear!
PSA.6.4	Yahweh, return to me and deliver my life
PSA.6.4	because I know your faithful love is toward me.
PSA.6.5	How can I be any good to you dead?
PSA.6.5	For graveyards sing no songs.
PSA.6.5	In the darkness of death who remembers you?
PSA.6.5	How could I bring you praise if I’m buried in a tomb?
PSA.6.6	I’m exhausted and worn out with my weeping.
PSA.6.6	I endure weary, sleepless nights filled with moaning,
PSA.6.6	soaking my pillow with my tears.
PSA.6.7	My eyes of faith won’t focus anymore, for sorrow fills my heart.
PSA.6.7	There are so many enemies who come against me!
PSA.6.8	Go away! Leave me, all you troublemakers!
PSA.6.8	For the Lord has turned to listen to my thunderous cry.
PSA.6.9	Yes! Yahweh 
PSA.6.9	and has taken hold of my prayers and answered them all.
PSA.6.10	Now it’s my enemies who have been shamed.
PSA.6.10	Terror-stricken, they will turn back again,
PSA.6.10	knowing the bitterness of sudden disgrace!
PSA.7.1	Yahweh my God, I turn aside to hide my soul in you.
PSA.7.1	Save me from all those who pursue and persecute me.
PSA.7.2	There is none to deliver me but you!
PSA.7.2	Don’t let my foes fall upon me like fierce lions with teeth bared.
PSA.7.2	Can’t you see how they want to rip me to shreds?
PSA.7.3	Lord, my God, if I were doing evil things, that would be different,
PSA.7.3	for then I would be guilty, deserving all of this.
PSA.7.4	If I have wronged someone at peace with me,
PSA.7.4	if I have betrayed a friend, repaying evil for good,
PSA.7.4	or if I have unjustly harmed my enemy,
PSA.7.5	 let my enemy pursue and overtake me.
PSA.7.5	, let them grind me into the ground.
PSA.7.5	Let them take my life from me and drag my dignity in the dust!
PSA.7.5	Pause in his presence
PSA.7.6	Now, Lord, let your anger arise against the anger of my enemies.
PSA.7.6	Awaken your fury and stand up for me!
PSA.7.6	Decree that justice be done against my foes.
PSA.7.7	Gather all the people around you.
PSA.7.7	Return to your place on high to preside over them
PSA.7.7	and once more occupy the throne of judgment.
PSA.7.8	You are the Exalted One who judges the people,
PSA.7.8	so vindicate me publicly and restore my honor and integrity.
PSA.7.8	Before all the people declare me innocent.
PSA.7.9	Once and for all, end the evil tactics of the wicked!
PSA.7.9	Reward and prosper the cause of the righteous,
PSA.7.9	for you are the righteous God, the soul searcher,
PSA.7.9	who looks deep into every heart
PSA.7.9	to examine the thoughts and motives.
PSA.7.10	God, your wrap-around presence
PSA.7.10	is my protection and my defense.
PSA.7.10	You bring victory to all who reach out for you.
PSA.7.11	Righteousness is revealed every time you judge.
PSA.7.11	Because of the strength of your forgiveness,
PSA.7.11	your anger does not break out every day,
PSA.7.11	even though you are a righteous judge.
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	Yet if the wicked do not repent,
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	you will not relent with your wrath,
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	slaying them with your shining sword.
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	You are the conqueror with an arsenal of lethal weapons
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	that you’ve prepared for them.
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	You have bent and strung your bow,
PSA.7.12+PSA.7.13	making your judgment-arrows shafts of burning fire.
PSA.7.14+PSA.7.15	Look how the wicked conceive their evil schemes.
PSA.7.14+PSA.7.15	They go into labor with their lies and give birth to trouble.
PSA.7.14+PSA.7.15	They dig a pit for others to fall into,
PSA.7.14+PSA.7.15	not knowing that they will be the very ones
PSA.7.14+PSA.7.15	who will fall into their own pit of failure.
PSA.7.16	For you, God, will see to it that every pit-digger
PSA.7.16	who works to trap and harm others
PSA.7.16	will be trapped and harmed by his own treachery.
PSA.7.17	But I will give all my thanks to you, Lord,
PSA.7.17	for you make everything right in the end.
PSA.7.17	I will sing my highest praise to the God of the Highest Place!
PSA.8.1	Lord, your name is so great and powerful!
PSA.8.1	People everywhere see your splendor.
PSA.8.1	Your glorious majesty streams from the heavens,
PSA.8.1	filling the earth with the fame of your name!
PSA.8.2	You have built a stronghold by the songs of babies.
PSA.8.2	Strength rises up with the chorus of singing children.
PSA.8.2	This kind of praise has the power to shut Satan’s mouth.
PSA.8.2	Childlike worship will silence
PSA.8.2	the madness of those who oppose you.
PSA.8.3	Look at the splendor of your skies,
PSA.8.3	your creative genius glowing in the heavens.
PSA.8.3	When I gaze at your moon and your stars,
PSA.8.3	mounted like jewels in their settings,
PSA.8.3	I know you are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all!
PSA.8.3	But when I look up and see
PSA.8.3	such wonder and workmanship above,
PSA.8.3	I have to ask you this question:
PSA.8.4	,
PSA.8.4	why would you bother with puny, mortal man
PSA.8.4	or be infatuated with Adam’s sons?
PSA.8.5	Yet what honor you have given to men,
PSA.8.5	created only a little lower than Elohim,
PSA.8.5	crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence.
PSA.8.6	You have delegated to them
PSA.8.6	mastery over all you have made,
PSA.8.6	making everything subservient to their authority,
PSA.8.6	placing earth itself under the feet of your image-bearers.
PSA.8.7+PSA.8.8	All the created order and every living thing
PSA.8.7+PSA.8.8	of the earth, sky, and sea—
PSA.8.7+PSA.8.8	the wildest beasts and all the sea creatures—
PSA.8.7+PSA.8.8	everything is in submission 
PSA.8.9	Lord, your name is so great and powerful.
PSA.8.9	People everywhere see your majesty!
PSA.8.9	What glory streams from the heavens,
PSA.8.9	filling the earth with the fame of your name!
PSA.9.1	Lord, I will worship you with extended hands
PSA.9.1	as my whole heart explodes with praise!
PSA.9.1	I will tell everyone everywhere about your wonderful works
PSA.9.1	and how your marvelous miracles exceed expectations!
PSA.9.2	I will jump for joy and shout in triumph
PSA.9.2	as I sing your song and make music for the Most High God.
PSA.9.3	For when you appear, I worship
PSA.9.3	while all of my enemies run in retreat.
PSA.9.3	They stumble and perish before your presence.
PSA.9.4	For you have stood up for my cause
PSA.9.4	and vindicated me when I needed you the most.
PSA.9.4	From your righteous throne you have given me justice.
PSA.9.5	With a blast of your rebuke nations are destroyed.
PSA.9.5	You obliterated their names forever and ever.
PSA.9.6	The Lord thundered and our enemies have been cut off,
PSA.9.6	vanished in everlasting ruins.
PSA.9.6	All their cities have been destroyed—
PSA.9.6	even the memory of them has been erased.
PSA.9.7	But the Lord of eternity, our mighty God, lives and reigns forever!
PSA.9.7	He sits enthroned as King ready to render his verdicts
PSA.9.7	and judge all with righteousness.
PSA.9.8	He will issue his decrees of judgment,
PSA.9.8	deciding what is right for the entire world,
PSA.9.8	dispensing justice to all.
PSA.9.9	All who are oppressed may come to you as a
PSA.9.9	shelter in the time of trouble, a perfect hiding place.
PSA.9.10	May everyone who knows your mercy
PSA.9.10	keep putting their trust in you,
PSA.9.10	for they can count on you for help no matter what.
PSA.9.10	O Lord, you will never, no never, neglect those
PSA.9.10	who come to you.
PSA.9.11	Listen, everyone! Sing out your praises to the God
PSA.9.11	who lives and rules within Zion!
PSA.9.11	Tell the world about all the miracles he has done!
PSA.9.12	He tracks down killers and avenges bloodshed,
PSA.9.12	but he will never forget the ones forgotten by others,
PSA.9.12	hearing every one of their cries for justice.
PSA.9.13	So now, O Lord, don’t forget me.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy on me.
PSA.9.13	Take note of how I’ve been humiliated
PSA.9.13	at the hands of those who hate me.
PSA.9.13	Bring me back again from the brink, from the very gates of death.
PSA.9.14	Save me! Bring me to the spiritual gates of Zion
PSA.9.14	so I can bring you the shout of praise you deserve.
PSA.9.15	For the godless nations get trapped
PSA.9.15	in the very snares they set for others.
PSA.9.15	The hidden trap they set for the weak
PSA.9.15	has snapped shut upon themselves—guilty!
PSA.9.16	The Lord is famous for this: his justice will punish the wicked.
PSA.9.16	While they are digging a pit for others,
PSA.9.16	they are actually setting the terms for their own judgment.
PSA.9.16	They will fall into their own pit.
PSA.9.16	Consider the truth of this and pause in his presence
PSA.9.17	Don’t forget this: all the wicked will one day
PSA.9.17	fall into the darkness of death’s domain and remain there,
PSA.9.17	including the nations that forget God and reject his ways.
PSA.9.18	He will not ignore forever all the needs of the poor,
PSA.9.18	for those in need shall not always be crushed.
PSA.9.18	Their hopes shall be fulfilled, 
PSA.9.19	Lord, won’t you now arise to judge and
PSA.9.19	punish the nations who defy you?
PSA.9.19	Aren’t you fed up with their rebellion?
PSA.9.20	Make them tremble in fear before your presence.
PSA.9.20	Place a lawgiver over them.
PSA.9.20	Make them know that they are only puny, frail humans
PSA.9.20	who must give account to you!
PSA.9.20	Pause in his presence
PSA.10.1	Lord, you seem so far away when evil is near!
PSA.10.1	Why do you stand so far off as though you don’t care?
PSA.10.1	Why have you hidden yourself when I need you the most?
PSA.10.2	The arrogant in their elitist pride persecute the poor and helpless.
PSA.10.2	May you pour out upon them
PSA.10.2	the very evil they’ve planned against others!
PSA.10.3	How they brag and boast of their cravings, exalting the greedy.
PSA.10.3	They congratulate themselves as they despise you.
PSA.10.4	These arrogant ones, so smug and secure!
PSA.10.4	In their delusion the wicked boast, saying,
PSA.10.4	“God doesn’t care about what we do.
PSA.10.4	There’s nothing to worry about!
PSA.10.4	Our wealth will last a lifetime.”
PSA.10.5	So seemingly successful are they in their schemes,
PSA.10.5	prosperous in all their plans and scoffing at any restraint.
PSA.10.6	They boast that neither God nor men will bring them down.
PSA.10.6	They sneer at all their enemies, saying in their hearts,
PSA.10.6	“We’ll have success in all we do
PSA.10.6	and never have to face trouble”—
PSA.10.6	never realizing that they are speaking this in vain.
PSA.10.7	Their mouths spout out cursing, lies, and threats.
PSA.10.7	Only trouble and turmoil come from all their plans.
PSA.10.8+PSA.10.9	Like beasts lurking in the shadows of the city
PSA.10.8+PSA.10.9	they crouch silently in ambush for the people to pass by.
PSA.10.8+PSA.10.9	Pouncing on the poor, they catch them in their snare
PSA.10.8+PSA.10.9	to murder their prey in secret
PSA.10.8+PSA.10.9	as they plunder their helpless victims.
PSA.10.10	They crush the lowly as they fall beneath their brutal blows,
PSA.10.10	watching their victims collapse in defeat!
PSA.10.11	Then they say to themselves,
PSA.10.11	“The Lofty One is not watching while we do this.
PSA.10.11	He doesn’t even care! We can get away with it!”
PSA.10.12	Now is the time to arise, Lord! Crush them once and for all!
PSA.10.12	Don’t forget the forgotten and the helpless.
PSA.10.13	How dare the wicked think they’ll escape judgment,
PSA.10.13	believing that you would not
PSA.10.13	call them to account for all their ways.
PSA.10.13	Don’t let the wicked get away with their contempt of you!
PSA.10.14	Lord, I know you see all that they’re doing,
PSA.10.14	noting their each and every deed.
PSA.10.14	You know the trouble and turmoil they’ve caused.
PSA.10.14	Now punish them thoroughly for all that they’ve done!
PSA.10.14	The poor and helpless ones trust in you, Lord,
PSA.10.14	for you are famous for being the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.14	I know you won’t let them down.
PSA.10.15	Break the power of the wicked and all their strong-arm tactics.
PSA.10.15	Search them out and destroy them
PSA.10.15	for the evil things they’ve done.
PSA.10.16	You, Lord, are King forever and ever!
PSA.10.16	You will see to it that all the nations perish from your land.
PSA.10.17	Lord, you know and understand all the hopes of the humble
PSA.10.17	and will hear their cries and comfort their hearts,
PSA.10.17	helping them all!
PSA.10.18	The orphans and the oppressed will be terrified no longer,
PSA.10.18	for you will bring them justice, and no one will trouble them.
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	Lord, 
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	 keep saying to me:
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	“Run away while you can!
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	Fly away like a bird to hide in the mountains for safety.
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	For your enemies have prepared a trap for you!
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	They plan to destroy you with their slander and deceitful lies.
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	Can’t you see them hiding
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	in their place of darkness and shadows?
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	They’re set against you and all those who live upright lives.”
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	But don’t they know, Lord,
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	that I have made you my only hiding place?
PSA.11.1+PSA.11.2	Don’t they know that I always trust in you?
PSA.11.3	What can the righteous accomplish
PSA.11.3	when truth’s pillars are destroyed and law and order collapse?
PSA.11.4	—
PSA.11.4	he is still found in his temple of holiness,
PSA.11.4	reigning as Lord and King over all.
PSA.11.4	He is closely watching everything that happens.
PSA.11.4	And with a glance, his eyes examine every heart.
PSA.11.4	For his heavenly rule will prevail over all.
PSA.11.5	He will test both the righteous 
PSA.11.5	.
PSA.11.5	God’s very soul detests those who love to resort to violence.
PSA.11.6	He will rain down upon them judgment for their sins.
PSA.11.6	A scorching wind will be their portion and lot in life.
PSA.11.7	But remember this: the Righteous Lord loves
PSA.11.7	what is right and just, and every godly one
PSA.11.7	will come into his presence and gaze upon his face!
PSA.12.1	Help, Lord! Save us! For godly ones are swiftly disappearing.
PSA.12.1	Where are the dependable, principled ones?
PSA.12.1	They’re a vanishing breed!
PSA.12.2	Everyone lies, everyone flatters, and everyone deceives.
PSA.12.2	Nothing but empty talk, smooth talk, and double-talk.
PSA.12.2	Where are the truthful?
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	I know the Lord will not deal gently with people like that!
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	You will destroy every proud liar who says, “We lie all we want.
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	Our words are our weapons, and we won’t be held accountable.
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	Who can stop us?”
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	May the Lord cut off their twisted tongues
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	and seal their lying lips.
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	May they all be silenced—those who boast and brag with their
PSA.12.3+PSA.12.4	high-minded talk about doing whatever they want.
PSA.12.5	But the Lord says, “Now I will arise!
PSA.12.5	I will defend the poor,
PSA.12.5	those who were plundered, the oppressed,
PSA.12.5	and the needy who groan for help.
PSA.12.5	I will arise to rescue and protect them!”
PSA.12.6	For every word God speaks is sure and every promise pure.
PSA.12.6	His truth is tested, found to be flawless, and ever faithful.
PSA.12.6	It’s as pure as silver refined seven times in a crucible of clay.
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	Lord, you will keep us forever safe,
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	out of the reach of the wicked.
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	Even though they strut and prowl,
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	tolerating and celebrating what is worthless and vile,
PSA.12.7+PSA.12.8	you will still lift up those who are yours!
PSA.13.1	I’m hurting, Lord—will you forget me forever?
PSA.13.1	How much longer, Lord?
PSA.13.1	Will you look the other way when I’m in need?
PSA.13.2	How much longer must I cling to this constant grief?
PSA.13.2	I’ve endured this shaking of my soul.
PSA.13.2	So how much longer will my enemy have the upper hand?
PSA.13.2	It’s been long enough!
PSA.13.3	Take a good look at me, God, and answer me!
PSA.13.3	Breathe your life into my spirit.
PSA.13.3	Bring light to my eyes in this pitch-black darkness
PSA.13.3	or I will sleep the sleep of death.
PSA.13.4	Don’t let my enemy proclaim, “I’ve prevailed over him.”
PSA.13.4	For all my adversaries will celebrate when I fall.
PSA.13.5	Lord, I have always trusted in your kindness, 
PSA.13.5	I will yet celebrate with passion and joy
PSA.13.5	when your salvation lifts me up.
PSA.13.6	I will sing my song of joy to you, the Most High,
PSA.13.6	for in all of this you have strengthened my soul.
PSA.13.6	My enemies say that I have no Savior,
PSA.13.6	but I know that I have one in you!
PSA.14.1	Only the withering soul would say to himself,
PSA.14.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.14.1	Anyone who thinks like this is corrupt and callous,
PSA.14.1	depraved and detestable, devoid of what is good.
PSA.14.2	The Lord looks down in love,
PSA.14.2	bending over heaven’s balcony,
PSA.14.2	looking over all of Adam’s sons and daughters.
PSA.14.2	He’s looking to see if there is anyone who acts wisely,
PSA.14.2	any who are searching for God and wanting to please him.
PSA.14.3	But no, everyone has wandered astray,
PSA.14.3	walking stubbornly toward evil.
PSA.14.3	Not one is good; he can’t even find one.
PSA.14.4	Look how they live in luxury while exploiting my people!
PSA.14.4	Won’t these workers of wickedness ever learn?
PSA.14.4	They don’t ever even think of praying to God.
PSA.14.5	But just look at them now, in panic, trembling with terror.
PSA.14.5	For the Lord is on the side of the generation of loyal lovers.
PSA.14.6	The Lord is always the safest place for the poor
PSA.14.6	when the workers of wickedness oppress them.
PSA.14.7	How I wish that Israel’s rescue
PSA.14.7	would arise from the midst of Zion!
PSA.14.7	When his people are restored,
PSA.14.7	Jacob’s joy will break forth
PSA.14.7	and Israel will be glad!
PSA.15.1	Lord, who dares to dwell with you?
PSA.15.1	Who presumes the privilege of being close to you,
PSA.15.1	living next to you in your shining place of glory?
PSA.15.1	Who are those who daily dwell in the life of the Holy Spirit?
PSA.15.2	They are passionate and wholehearted,
PSA.15.2	always sincere and always speaking the truth—
PSA.15.2	for their hearts are trustworthy.
PSA.15.3	They refuse to slander or insult others;
PSA.15.3	they’ll never listen to gossip or rumors,
PSA.15.3	nor would they ever harm another with their words.
PSA.15.4	They will speak out passionately against evil and evil workers
PSA.15.4	while commending the faithful ones who follow after the truth.
PSA.15.4	They make firm commitments and follow through,
PSA.15.4	even at great cost.
PSA.15.5	They never crush others with exploitation or abuse
PSA.15.5	and they would never be bought with a bribe
PSA.15.5	against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	They will never be shaken; they will stand firm forever.
PSA.16.1	Keep me safe, O mighty God.
PSA.16.1	I run for dear life to you, my safe place.
PSA.16.2	So I said to the Lord God,
PSA.16.2	“You are my Maker, my Mediator, and my Master.
PSA.16.2	Any good thing you find in me has come from you.”
PSA.16.3	, “My holy lovers are wonderful,
PSA.16.3	my majestic ones, my glorious ones,
PSA.16.3	fulfilling all my desires.”
PSA.16.4	Yet there are those who yield to their weakness,
PSA.16.4	and they will have troubles and sorrows unending.
PSA.16.4	I never gather with such ones,
PSA.16.4	nor give them honor in any way.
PSA.16.5	Lord, I have chosen you alone as my inheritance.
PSA.16.5	You are my prize, my pleasure, and my portion.
PSA.16.5	I leave my destiny 
PSA.16.6	Your pleasant path leads me to pleasant places.
PSA.16.6	I’m overwhelmed by the privileges
PSA.16.6	that come with following you,
PSA.16.6	for you have given me the best!
PSA.16.7	The way you counsel and correct me makes me praise you more,
PSA.16.7	for your whispers in the night give me wisdom,
PSA.16.7	showing me what to do next.
PSA.16.8	Because you are close to me and always available,
PSA.16.8	my confidence will never be shaken,
PSA.16.8	for I experience your wrap-around presence every moment.
PSA.16.9	My heart and soul explode with joy—full of glory!
PSA.16.9	Even my body will rest confident and secure.
PSA.16.10	For you will not abandon me to the realm of death,
PSA.16.10	nor will you allow your Holy One to experience corruption.
PSA.16.11	For you bring me a continual revelation of resurrection life,
PSA.16.11	the path to the bliss that brings me face-to-face with you.
PSA.17.1	Listen to me, Lord.
PSA.17.1	Hear the passionate prayer of this honest man.
PSA.17.1	It’s my piercing cry for justice!
PSA.17.1	My cause is just and my need is real.
PSA.17.1	I’ve done what’s right and my lips speak truth.
PSA.17.2	Lord, I always live my life before your face,
PSA.17.2	so examine and exonerate me.
PSA.17.2	Vindicate me and show the world I’m innocent.
PSA.17.3	For in a visitation of the night
PSA.17.3	you inspected my heart and refined my soul in fire
PSA.17.3	until nothing vile was found in me.
PSA.17.3	I’ve wanted my words and my ways to always agree.
PSA.17.4	Following your word has kept me from wrong.
PSA.17.4	Your ways have molded my footsteps, keeping me
PSA.17.4	from going down the forbidden paths of the destroyer.
PSA.17.5	My steps follow in the tracks of your chariot wheels,
PSA.17.5	always staying in their path,
PSA.17.5	never straying from your way.
PSA.17.6	You will answer me, God; I know you always will,
PSA.17.6	like you always do as you listen with love to my every prayer.
PSA.17.7	Magnify the marvels of your mercy to all who seek you.
PSA.17.7	Make your Pure One wonderful to me,
PSA.17.7	like you do for all those who turn aside
PSA.17.7	to hide themselves in you.
PSA.17.8	Protect me from harm;
PSA.17.8	keep an eye on me like you would a child
PSA.17.8	reflected in the twinkling of your eye.
PSA.17.8	Yes, hide me within the shelter of your embrace,
PSA.17.8	under your outstretched wings.
PSA.17.9	Protect me there from all my foes.
PSA.17.9	For there are many who surround my soul
PSA.17.9	to completely destroy me.
PSA.17.10	They are pitiless, heartless—hard as nails,
PSA.17.10	swollen with pride and filled with arrogance!
PSA.17.11	See how they close in on me,
PSA.17.11	waiting for the chance to throw me to the ground.
PSA.17.12	They’re like lions eager to tear me apart,
PSA.17.12	like young and fearless lions lurking in secret,
PSA.17.12	so ferocious and cruel—ready to rip me to shreds.
PSA.17.13	Arise, God, and confront them!
PSA.17.13	Challenge them with your might!
PSA.17.13	Free me from their clutches and rescue me from their rage.
PSA.17.14	Throw them down to the ground,
PSA.17.14	those who live for only this life on earth.
PSA.17.14	Thrust them out of their prosperity
PSA.17.14	and into their portion in eternity,
PSA.17.14	leaving their wealth and wickedness behind!
PSA.17.15	As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face
PSA.17.15	until I see you for who you really are.
PSA.17.15	Then I will awaken with your form and be fully satisfied,
PSA.17.15	fulfilled in the revelation of your glory in me!
PSA.18.1	Lord, I passionately love you and I’m bonded to you,
PSA.18.1	for now you’ve become my power!
PSA.18.2	You’re as real to me as bedrock beneath my feet,
PSA.18.2	like a castle on a cliff, my forever firm fortress,
PSA.18.2	my mountain of hiding, my pathway of escape,
PSA.18.2	my tower of rescue where none can reach me.
PSA.18.2	My secret strength and shield around me,
PSA.18.2	you are salvation’s ray of brightness shining on the hillside,
PSA.18.2	always the champion of my cause.
PSA.18.3	All I need to do is to call to you,
PSA.18.3	singing to you, the praiseworthy God.
PSA.18.3	When I do, I’m safe and sound in you.
PSA.18.4+PSA.18.5	For when the ropes of death wrapped around me
PSA.18.4+PSA.18.5	and terrifying torrents of destruction overwhelmed me,
PSA.18.4+PSA.18.5	taking me to death’s door, to doom’s domain,
PSA.18.6	I cried out to you in my distress, the delivering God,
PSA.18.6	and from your temple-throne you heard my troubled cry.
PSA.18.6	My sobs came right into your heart
PSA.18.6	and you turned your face to rescue me.
PSA.18.7	The earth itself shivered and shook.
PSA.18.7	It reeled and rocked before him.
PSA.18.7	As the mountains trembled, they melted away!
PSA.18.7	For his anger was kindled, burning on my behalf.
PSA.18.8	Fierce flames leapt from his mouth,
PSA.18.8	erupting with blazing, burning coals as smoke
PSA.18.8	and fire encircled him.
PSA.18.9+PSA.18.10	He stretched heaven’s curtain open and came to my defense.
PSA.18.9+PSA.18.10	Swiftly he rode to earth as the stormy sky was lowered.
PSA.18.9+PSA.18.10	He rode a chariot of thunderclouds amidst thick darkness,
PSA.18.9+PSA.18.10	a cherub his steed as he swooped down,
PSA.18.9+PSA.18.10	soaring on the wings of Spirit-wind.
PSA.18.11	Wrapped and hidden in the thick-cloud darkness,
PSA.18.11	his thunder-tabernacle surrounded him.
PSA.18.11	He hid himself in mystery-darkness;
PSA.18.11	the dense rain clouds were his garments.
PSA.18.12	Suddenly the brilliance of his presence broke through
PSA.18.12	with lightning bolts and with a mighty storm from heaven—
PSA.18.12	like a tempest dropping coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The Lord thundered, the great God above every god
PSA.18.13	spoke with his thunder-voice from the skies.
PSA.18.13	What fearsome hailstones and flashes of fire were before him!
PSA.18.14	He released his lightning-arrows, and routed my foes.
PSA.18.14	See how they ran and scattered in fear!
PSA.18.15	Then with his mighty roar he laid bare the foundations of the earth,
PSA.18.15	uncovering the secret source of the sea.
PSA.18.15	The hidden depths of land and sea were exposed
PSA.18.15	by the hurricane-blast of his hot breath.
PSA.18.16	He then reached down from heaven,
PSA.18.16	all the way from the sky to the sea.
PSA.18.16	He reached down into my darkness to rescue me!
PSA.18.16	He took me out of my calamity and chaos
PSA.18.16	and drew me to himself,
PSA.18.16	taking me from the depths of my despair!
PSA.18.17	Even though I was helpless in the hands
PSA.18.17	of my hateful, strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	you were good to deliver me.
PSA.18.18	When I was at my weakest, my enemies attacked—
PSA.18.18	but the Lord held on to me.
PSA.18.19	His love broke open the way
PSA.18.19	and he brought me into a beautiful broad place.
PSA.18.19	He rescued me—because his delight is in me!
PSA.18.20	He rewarded me for doing what’s right and staying pure.
PSA.18.21	I will follow his commands and never stop.
PSA.18.21	I’ll not sin by ceasing to follow him, no matter what.
PSA.18.22	For I’ve kept my eyes focused on his righteous words
PSA.18.22	and I’ve obeyed everything that he’s told me to do.
PSA.18.23	I’ve done my best to be blameless and to follow all his ways,
PSA.18.23	keeping my heart pure.
PSA.18.24	I’ve kept my integrity by surrendering to him.
PSA.18.24	And so the Lord has rewarded me with his blessing.
PSA.18.24	This is the treasure I discovered
PSA.18.24	when I kept my heart clean before his eyes.
PSA.18.25	Lord, it is clear to me now that how we live
PSA.18.25	will dictate how you deal with us.
PSA.18.25	Good people will taste your goodness, Lord.
PSA.18.25	And to those who are loyal to you,
PSA.18.25	you love to prove that you are loyal and true.
PSA.18.26	And for those who are purified, they find you always pure.
PSA.18.26	But you’ll outwit the crooked and cunning with your craftiness.
PSA.18.27	To the humble you bring heaven’s deliverance.
PSA.18.27	But the proud and haughty you disregard.
PSA.18.28	God, all at once you turned on a floodlight for me!
PSA.18.28	You are the revelation-light in my darkness,
PSA.18.28	and in your brightness I can see the path ahead.
PSA.18.29	With you as my strength I can crush an enemy horde,
PSA.18.29	advancing through every stronghold that stands in front of me.
PSA.18.30	What a God you are! Your path for me has been perfect!
PSA.18.30	All your promises have proven true.
PSA.18.30	What a secure shelter for all those
PSA.18.30	who turn to hide themselves in you!
PSA.18.30	You are the wrap-around God giving grace to me.
PSA.18.31	Could there be any other god like you?
PSA.18.31	You are the only God to be worshiped,
PSA.18.31	for there is not a more secure foundation
PSA.18.31	to build my life upon than you.
PSA.18.32	You have wrapped me in power,
PSA.18.32	and now you’ve shared with me your perfection.
PSA.18.33	Through you I ascend to the highest peaks of your glory
PSA.18.33	to stand in the heavenly places, strong and secure in you.
PSA.18.34	You’ve trained me with the weapons of warfare-worship;
PSA.18.34	now I’ll descend into battle with power
PSA.18.34	to chase and conquer my foes.
PSA.18.35	You empower me for victory with your wrap-around presence.
PSA.18.35	Your power within makes me strong to subdue,
PSA.18.35	and by stooping down in gentleness
PSA.18.35	you strengthened me and made me great!
PSA.18.36	You’ve set me free from captivity
PSA.18.36	and now I’m standing complete, ready to fight some more!
PSA.18.37	I caught up with my enemies and conquered them,
PSA.18.37	and didn’t turn back until the war was won!
PSA.18.38	I pinned them to the ground and broke them to pieces.
PSA.18.38	I finished them once and for all; they’re as good as dead.
PSA.18.39	You’ve placed your armor upon me
PSA.18.39	and defeated my enemies, making them bow low at my feet.
PSA.18.40	You’ve made them all turn tail and run,
PSA.18.40	for through you I’ve destroyed them all!
PSA.18.40	Forever silenced, they’ll never taunt me again.
PSA.18.41	They shouted for help but not one dared to rescue them.
PSA.18.41	They shouted to God but he refused to answer them.
PSA.18.42	So I pulverized them to powder and cast them to the wind.
PSA.18.42	I swept them away like dirt on the floor.
PSA.18.43	You gave me victory on every side,
PSA.18.43	for look how the nations come to serve me.
PSA.18.43	Even those I’ve never heard of come and bow at my feet.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they heard of me they submitted to me.
PSA.18.44	Even the rebel foreigners obey my every word.
PSA.18.45	Their rebellion fades away as they come near;
PSA.18.45	trembling in their strongholds,
PSA.18.45	they come crawling out of their hideouts.
PSA.18.45	Cringing in fear before me, their courage is gone.
PSA.18.46	The Almighty is alive and conquers all!
PSA.18.46	Praise is lifted high to the unshakable God!
PSA.18.46	Towering over all, my Savior-God is worthy to be praised!
PSA.18.47	Look how he pays back harm to all who harm me,
PSA.18.47	subduing all the people who come against me.
PSA.18.48	He rescues me from my enemies;
PSA.18.48	he lifts me up high and keeps me out of reach,
PSA.18.48	far from the grasp of my violent foe.
PSA.18.49	This is why I thank God with high praises!
PSA.18.49	I will sing my song to the highest God,
PSA.18.49	so all among the nations will hear me.
PSA.18.50	You have appointed me king and rescued me
PSA.18.50	time and time again with your magnificent miracles.
PSA.18.50	You’ve been merciful and kind to me, your anointed one.
PSA.18.50	This favor will be forever seen upon your loving servant, David,
PSA.18.50	and to all my descendants!
PSA.19.1	God’s splendor is a tale that is told;
PSA.19.1	his testament is written in the stars.
PSA.19.1	Space itself speaks his story every day
PSA.19.1	through the marvels of the heavens.
PSA.19.1	His truth is on tour in the starry vault of the sky,
PSA.19.1	showing his skill in creation’s craftsmanship.
PSA.19.2	Each day gushes out its message to the next,
PSA.19.2	night with night whispering its knowledge to all.
PSA.19.3	Without a sound, without a word, without a voice being heard,
PSA.19.4	Yet all the world can see its story.
PSA.19.4	Everywhere its gospel is clearly read so all may know.
PSA.19.5	What a heavenly home God has set for the sun,
PSA.19.5	shining in the superdome of the sky!
PSA.19.5	See how he leaves his celestial chamber each morning,
PSA.19.5	radiant as a bridegroom ready for his wedding,
PSA.19.5	like a day-breaking champion eager to run his course.
PSA.19.6	He rises on one horizon, completing his circuit on the other,
PSA.19.6	warming lives and lands with his heat.
PSA.19.7	God’s Word is perfect in every way;
PSA.19.7	how it revives our souls!
PSA.19.7	His laws lead us to truth,
PSA.19.7	and his ways change the simple into wise.
PSA.19.8	His teachings make us joyful and radiate his light;
PSA.19.8	his precepts are so pure!
PSA.19.8	His commands, how they challenge us to keep close to his heart!
PSA.19.8	The revelation-light of his word makes my spirit shine radiant.
PSA.19.9	Every one of the Lord’s commands is right;
PSA.19.9	following them brings cheer.
PSA.19.9	Nothing he says ever needs to be changed.
PSA.19.10	The rarest treasures of life are found in his truth.
PSA.19.10	That’s why I prize God’s word like others prize the finest gold.
PSA.19.10	Nothing brings the soul such sweetness
PSA.19.10	as seeking his living words.
PSA.19.11	For they warn us, his servants,
PSA.19.11	and keep us from following the wicked way,
PSA.19.11	giving a lifetime guarantee:
PSA.19.11	great success to every obedient soul!
PSA.19.12	,
PSA.19.12	how would I ever detect the waywardness of my heart?
PSA.19.12	Lord, forgive my hidden flaws whenever you find them.
PSA.19.13	Keep cleansing me, God,
PSA.19.13	and keep me from my secret, selfish sins;
PSA.19.13	may they never rule over me!
PSA.19.13	For only then will I be free from fault
PSA.19.13	and remain innocent of rebellion.
PSA.19.14	So may the words of my mouth, my meditation-thoughts,
PSA.19.14	and every movement of my heart be always pure and pleasing,
PSA.19.14	acceptable before your eyes,
PSA.19.14	my only Redeemer, my Protector-God.
PSA.20.1	In your day of danger may the Lord answer and deliver you.
PSA.20.1	May the name of the God of Jacob set you safely on high!
PSA.20.2	May supernatural help be sent from his sanctuary.
PSA.20.2	May he support you from Zion’s fortress!
PSA.20.3	May he remember every gift you have given him
PSA.20.3	and celebrate every sacrifice of love you have shown him.
PSA.20.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.20.4	May God give you every desire of your heart
PSA.20.4	and carry out your every plan 
PSA.20.5	When you succeed, we will celebrate and shout for joy.
PSA.20.5	Flags will fly when victory is yours!
PSA.20.5	Yes, God will answer your prayers and we will praise him!
PSA.20.6	I know God gives me all that I ask for
PSA.20.6	and brings victory to his anointed king.
PSA.20.6	My deliverance cry will be heard in his holy heaven.
PSA.20.6	By his mighty hand miracles will manifest
PSA.20.6	through his saving strength.
PSA.20.7	Some find their strength in their weapons and wisdom,
PSA.20.7	but my miracle deliverance can never be won by men.
PSA.20.7	Our boast is in the Lord our God,
PSA.20.7	who makes us strong and gives us victory!
PSA.20.8	Our enemies will not prevail; they will only collapse and
PSA.20.8	perish in defeat while we will rise up, full of courage.
PSA.20.9	Give victory to our king, O God!
PSA.20.9	The day we call on you, give us your answer!
PSA.21.1	Lord, because of your strength the king is strong.
PSA.21.1	Look how he rejoices in you!
PSA.21.1	He bursts out with a joyful song because of your victory!
PSA.21.2	For you have given him his heart’s desire,
PSA.21.2	anything and everything he asks for.
PSA.21.2	You haven’t withheld a thing from your betrothed one.
PSA.21.2	Pause in his presence
PSA.21.3	Rich blessings overflow with every encounter with you,
PSA.21.3	and you placed a royal crown of gold upon his head.
PSA.21.4	He wanted resurrection—you have given it to him and more!
PSA.21.4	The days of his blessing stretch on one after another, forever!
PSA.21.5	You have honored him and made him famous.
PSA.21.5	Glory garments are upon him,
PSA.21.5	and you surround him with splendor and majesty.
PSA.21.6	Your victory heaps blessing after blessing upon him.
PSA.21.6	What joy and bliss he tastes, rejoicing before your face!
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts endlessly in you,
PSA.21.7	and he will never stumble, never fall.
PSA.21.7	Your forever-love never fails and holds him firm.
PSA.21.8	Your almighty hands have captured your foes.
PSA.21.8	You uncovered all who hate you and you seized them.
PSA.21.9+PSA.21.10	When you appear before them,
PSA.21.9+PSA.21.10	,
PSA.21.9+PSA.21.10	they will be consumed by the fierce fire of your presence.
PSA.21.9+PSA.21.10	Flames will swallow them up.
PSA.21.9+PSA.21.10	They and their descendants
PSA.21.9+PSA.21.10	will be destroyed by an unrelenting fire.
PSA.21.11	We will watch them fail,
PSA.21.11	for these are ones who plan their evil schemes against the Lord.
PSA.21.12	They will turn and run at the sight of your judgment-arrow
PSA.21.12	aimed straight at their hearts.
PSA.21.13	Rise up and put your might on display!
PSA.21.13	By your strength we will sing and praise your glorious power!
PSA.22.1	God, my God!
PSA.22.1	Why would you abandon me now?
PSA.22.2	Why do you remain distant,
PSA.22.2	refusing to answer my tearful cries in the day
PSA.22.2	and my desperate cries for your help in the night?
PSA.22.2	I can’t stop sobbing.
PSA.22.2	Where are you, my God?
PSA.22.3	Yet I know that you are most holy; it’s indisputable.
PSA.22.3	You are God-Enthroned, surrounded with songs,
PSA.22.3	living among the shouts of praise of your princely people.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers’ faith was in you—
PSA.22.4	through the generations they trusted and believed in you
PSA.22.4	and you came through.
PSA.22.5	Every time they cried out to you in their despair,
PSA.22.5	you were faithful to deliver them;
PSA.22.5	you didn’t disappoint them.
PSA.22.6	But look at me now; I am like a woeful worm,
PSA.22.6	crushed, and I’m bleeding crimson.
PSA.22.6	I don’t even look like a man anymore.
PSA.22.6	I’ve been abused, despised, and scorned by everyone!
PSA.22.7	Mocked by their jeers, despised with their sneers,
PSA.22.7	as all the people poke fun at me, spitting their insults,
PSA.22.8	saying, “Is this the one who trusted in God?
PSA.22.8	Is this the one who claims God is pleased with him?
PSA.22.8	Now let’s see if your God will come to your rescue!
PSA.22.8	We’ll just see how much he delights in you!”
PSA.22.9	Lord, you delivered me safely from my mother’s womb.
PSA.22.9	You are the one who cared for me ever since I was a baby.
PSA.22.10	Since the day I was born, I’ve been placed in your custody.
PSA.22.10	You’ve cradled me throughout my days.
PSA.22.10	I’ve trusted in you and you’ve always been my God.
PSA.22.11	So don’t leave me now; stay close to me!
PSA.22.11	For trouble is all around me and there’s no one else to help me.
PSA.22.12	I’m surrounded by many violent foes;
PSA.22.12	mighty forces of evil are swirling around me
PSA.22.12	who want to break me to bits and destroy me.
PSA.22.13	Curses pour from their mouths!
PSA.22.13	They’re like ravenous, roaring lions tearing their prey.
PSA.22.14	Now I’m completely exhausted; I’m spent.
PSA.22.14	Every joint of my body has been pulled apart.
PSA.22.14	My courage has vanished and
PSA.22.14	my inward parts have melted away.
PSA.22.15	I’m so thirsty and parched—dry as a bone.
PSA.22.15	My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
PSA.22.15	And now you’ve left me in the dust for dead.
PSA.22.16	They have pierced my hands and my feet.
PSA.22.16	Like a pack of wild dogs they tear at me,
PSA.22.16	swirling around me with their hatred.
PSA.22.16	They gather around me like lions to pin my hands and feet.
PSA.22.17	All my bones stick out.
PSA.22.17	Look at how they all gloat over me and stare!
PSA.22.18	With a toss of the dice they divide my clothes among themselves,
PSA.22.18	gambling for my garments!
PSA.22.19	Lord, my God, please don’t stay far away.
PSA.22.19	For you are my only might and strength.
PSA.22.19	Won’t you come quickly to my rescue?
PSA.22.20	Give me back my life.
PSA.22.20	Save me from this violent death.
PSA.22.20	Save my precious one and only
PSA.22.20	from the power of these demons!
PSA.22.21	Save me from all the power of the enemy,
PSA.22.21	from this roaring lion raging against me
PSA.22.21	and the power of his dark horde.
PSA.22.22	I will praise your name before all my brothers;
PSA.22.22	as my people gather I will praise you in their midst.
PSA.22.23	Lovers of Yahweh, praise him!
PSA.22.23	Let all the true seed of Jacob glorify him with your praises.
PSA.22.23	Stand in awe of him, all you princely people,
PSA.22.23	the offspring of Israel!
PSA.22.24	For he has not despised my cries of deep despair.
PSA.22.24	He’s my first responder to my sufferings,
PSA.22.24	and he didn’t look the other way when I was in pain.
PSA.22.24	He was there all the time, listening to the song of the afflicted.
PSA.22.25	You’re the reason for my praise; it comes from you and goes to you.
PSA.22.25	I will keep my promise to praise you before all who fear you
PSA.22.25	among the congregation of your people.
PSA.22.26	I will invite the poor and broken,
PSA.22.26	and they will come and eat until satisfied.
PSA.22.26	Bring Yahweh praise and you will find him.
PSA.22.26	Your hearts will overflow with life forever!
PSA.22.27	From the four corners of the earth,
PSA.22.27	the peoples of the world will remember and return to the Lord.
PSA.22.27	Every nation will come and worship him.
PSA.22.28	For the Lord is King of all, who takes charge of all the nations.
PSA.22.29	There they are! They’re worshiping!
PSA.22.29	The wealthy of this world will feast in fellowship with him
PSA.22.29	right alongside the humble of heart,
PSA.22.29	bowing down to the dust, forsaking their own souls.
PSA.22.29	They will all come and worship this worthy King!
PSA.22.30	His 
PSA.22.30	Future generations will hear from us
PSA.22.30	about the wonders of the Sovereign Lord.
PSA.22.31	His generation yet to be born will glorify him.
PSA.22.31	And they will all declare, “It is finished!”
PSA.23.1	The Lord is my best friend and my shepherd.
PSA.23.1	I always have more than enough.
PSA.23.2	He offers a resting place for me in his luxurious love.
PSA.23.2	His tracks take me to an oasis of peace, 
PSA.23.3	That’s where he restores and revives my life.
PSA.23.3	He opens before me pathways to God’s pleasure
PSA.23.3	and leads me along in his footsteps of righteousness
PSA.23.3	so that I can bring honor to his name.
PSA.23.4	Lord, even when your path takes me through
PSA.23.4	the valley of deepest darkness,
PSA.23.4	fear will never conquer me, for you already have!
PSA.23.4	You remain close to me and lead me through it all the way.
PSA.23.4	Your authority is my strength and my peace.
PSA.23.4	The comfort of your love takes away my fear.
PSA.23.4	.
PSA.23.5	You become my delicious feast
PSA.23.5	even when my enemies dare to fight.
PSA.23.5	You anoint me with the fragrance of your Holy Spirit;
PSA.23.5	you give me all I can drink of you until my heart overflows.
PSA.23.6	So why would I fear the future?
PSA.23.6	For your goodness and love pursue me all the days of my life.
PSA.23.6	Then afterward, when my life is through,
PSA.23.6	I’ll return to your glorious presence to be forever with you!
PSA.24.1	God claims the world as his.
PSA.24.1	Everything and everyone belongs to him!
PSA.24.2	He’s the one who pushed back oceans
PSA.24.2	to let the dry ground appear,
PSA.24.2	planting firm foundations for the earth.
PSA.24.3	Who, then, ascends into the presence of the Lord?
PSA.24.3	And who has the privilege of entering into God’s Holy Place?
PSA.24.4	Those who are clean—whose works and ways are pure,
PSA.24.4	whose hearts are true and sealed by the truth,
PSA.24.4	those who never deceive, whose words are sure.
PSA.24.5	They will receive the Lord’s blessing
PSA.24.5	and righteousness given by the Savior-God.
PSA.24.6	They will stand before God,
PSA.24.6	for they seek the pleasure of God’s face, the God of Jacob.
PSA.24.6	Pause in his presence
PSA.24.7	So wake up, you living gateways!
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, you ageless doors of destiny!
PSA.24.7	Welcome the King of Glory,
PSA.24.7	for he is about to come through you.
PSA.24.8	You ask, “Who is this Glory-King?”
PSA.24.8	The Lord, armed and ready for battle,
PSA.24.8	the Mighty One, invincible in every way!
PSA.24.9	So wake up, you living gateways, and rejoice!
PSA.24.9	Fling wide, you ageless doors of destiny!
PSA.24.9	Here he comes; the King of Glory is ready to come in.
PSA.24.10	You ask, “Who is this King of Glory?”
PSA.24.10	He is the Lord of Victory, armed and ready for battle,
PSA.24.10	the Mighty One, the invincible commander of heaven’s hosts!
PSA.24.10	Yes, he is the King of Glory!
PSA.24.10	Pause in his presence
PSA.25.1	Forever I will lift up my soul into your presence, Lord.
PSA.25.2	Be there for me, God, for I keep trusting in you.
PSA.25.2	Don’t allow my foes to gloat over me or
PSA.25.2	the shame of defeat to overtake me.
PSA.25.3	For how could anyone be disgraced
PSA.25.3	when he has entwined his heart with you?
PSA.25.3	But they will all be defeated and ashamed
PSA.25.3	when they harm the innocent.
PSA.25.4	Lord, direct me throughout my journey
PSA.25.4	so I can experience your plans for my life.
PSA.25.4	Reveal the life-paths that are pleasing to you.
PSA.25.5	Escort me along the way; take me by the hand and teach me.
PSA.25.5	For you are the God of my increasing salvation;
PSA.25.5	I have wrapped my heart into yours!
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	Forgive my failures as a young man,
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	and overlook the sins of my immaturity.
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	Give me grace, Lord! Always look at me
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	through your eyes of love—
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	your forgiving eyes of mercy and compassion.
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	When you think of me, see me as one you love and care for.
PSA.25.6+PSA.25.7	How good you are to me!
PSA.25.8	When people turn to you,
PSA.25.8	they discover how easy you are to please—so faithful and true!
PSA.25.8	Joyfully you teach them the proper path,
PSA.25.8	even when they go astray.
PSA.25.9	Keep showing the humble your path,
PSA.25.9	and lead them into the best decision.
PSA.25.9	Bring revelation-light that trains them in the truth.
PSA.25.10	All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful for those who follow the ways of his covenant.
PSA.25.11	For the honor of your name, Lord,
PSA.25.11	never count my sins, and forgive them all—
PSA.25.11	lift their burden off of my life!
PSA.25.12	Who are they that live in the holy fear of God?
PSA.25.12	You will show them the right path to take.
PSA.25.13	Then prosperity and favor will be their portion,
PSA.25.13	and their descendants will inherit all that is good.
PSA.25.14	There’s a private place reserved for the lovers of God,
PSA.25.14	where they sit near him and receive
PSA.25.14	the revelation-secrets of his promises.
PSA.25.15	Rescue me, Lord, for you’re my only hero.
PSA.25.16	Sorrows fill my heart as I feel helpless, mistreated—
PSA.25.16	I’m all alone and in misery!
PSA.25.16	Come closer to me now, Lord, for I need your mercy.
PSA.25.17	Turn to me, for my problems seem to be going from bad to worse.
PSA.25.17	Only you can free me from all these troubles!
PSA.25.18	Until you lift this burden, the burden of all my sins,
PSA.25.18	my troubles and trials will be more than I can handle.
PSA.25.18	Can’t you feel my pain?
PSA.25.19	Vicious enemies hate me.
PSA.25.19	There are so many, Lord. Can’t you see?
PSA.25.20	Will you protect me from their power against me?
PSA.25.20	Let it never be said that I trusted you
PSA.25.20	and you didn’t come to my rescue.
PSA.25.21	Your perfection and faithfulness are my bodyguards,
PSA.25.21	for you are my hope and I trust in you as my only protection.
PSA.25.22	Zealously, God, we ask you
PSA.25.22	to come save Israel from all her troubles,
PSA.25.22	for you provide the ransom price for your people!
PSA.26.1	You be my judge and declare me innocent!
PSA.26.1	Clear my name, for I have tried my best to keep your laws
PSA.26.1	and to trust you without wavering.
PSA.26.2	Lord, you can scrutinize me.
PSA.26.2	Refine my heart and probe my every thought.
PSA.26.2	Put me to the test and you’ll find it’s true.
PSA.26.3	I will never lose sight of your love for me.
PSA.26.3	Your faithfulness has steadied my steps.
PSA.26.4	I won’t keep company with tricky, two-faced men,
PSA.26.4	nor will I go the way of those who defraud with hidden motives.
PSA.26.5	I despise the sinner’s hangouts, refusing to even enter them.
PSA.26.5	You won’t find me walking among the wicked.
PSA.26.6+PSA.26.7	When I come before you, I’ll come clean,
PSA.26.6+PSA.26.7	approaching your altar with songs of thanksgiving,
PSA.26.6+PSA.26.7	singing the songs of your mighty miracles.
PSA.26.8	Lord, I love your home, this place of dazzling glory,
PSA.26.8	bathed in the splendor and light of your presence!
PSA.26.9	Don’t treat me as one of these scheming sinners
PSA.26.9	who plot violence against the innocent.
PSA.26.10	Look how they devise their wicked plans,
PSA.26.10	holding the innocent hostage for ransom.
PSA.26.11	I’m not like them, Lord—not at all.
PSA.26.11	Save me, redeem me with your mercy,
PSA.26.11	for I have chosen to walk only in what is right.
PSA.26.12	I will proclaim it publicly in every congregation,
PSA.26.12	and because of you, Lord,
PSA.26.12	I will take my stand on righteousness alone!
PSA.27.1	The Lord is my revelation-light to guide me along the way;
PSA.27.1	he’s the source of my salvation to defend me every day.
PSA.27.1	I fear no one!
PSA.27.1	I’ll never turn back and run from you, Lord;
PSA.27.1	surround and protect me.
PSA.27.2	When evil ones come to destroy me,
PSA.27.2	they will be the ones who turn back.
PSA.27.3	My heart will not be afraid even if an army rises to attack.
PSA.27.3	I know that you are there for me, so I will not be shaken.
PSA.27.4	Here’s the one thing I crave from God,
PSA.27.4	the one thing I seek above all else:
PSA.27.4	I want the privilege of living with him every moment in his house,
PSA.27.4	finding the sweet loveliness of his face,
PSA.27.4	filled with awe, delighting in his glory and grace.
PSA.27.4	I want to live my life so close to him
PSA.27.4	that he takes pleasure in my every prayer.
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	In his shelter in the day of trouble, that’s where you’ll find me,
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	for he hides me there in his holiness.
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	He has smuggled me into his secret place,
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	where I’m kept safe and secure—
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	out of reach from all my enemies.
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	Triumphant now, I’ll bring him my offerings of praise,
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	singing and shouting with ecstatic joy!
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	Yes, listen and you can hear
PSA.27.5+PSA.27.6	the fanfare of my shouts of praise to the Lord!
PSA.27.7	God, hear my cry. Show me your grace.
PSA.27.7	Show me mercy, and send the help I need!
PSA.27.8	Lord, when you said to me, “Seek my face,”
PSA.27.8	my inner being responded,
PSA.27.8	“I’m seeking your face with all my heart.”
PSA.27.9	So don’t hide yourself, Lord, when I come to find you.
PSA.27.9	You’re the God of my salvation;
PSA.27.9	how can you reject your servant in anger?
PSA.27.9	You’ve been my only hope,
PSA.27.9	so don’t forsake me now when I need you!
PSA.27.10	My father and mother abandoned me. I’m like an orphan!
PSA.27.10	But you took me in and made me yours.
PSA.27.11	Now teach me all about your ways and tell me what to do.
PSA.27.11	Make it clear for me to understand,
PSA.27.11	for I am surrounded by waiting enemies.
PSA.27.12	Don’t let them defeat me, Lord.
PSA.27.12	You can’t let me fall into their clutches!
PSA.27.12	They keep accusing me of things I’ve never done
PSA.27.12	while they plot evil against me.
PSA.27.13	Yet I totally trust you to rescue me one more time,
PSA.27.13	so that I can see once again how good you are while I’m still alive!
PSA.27.14	Here’s what I’ve learned through it all:
PSA.27.14	Don’t give up; don’t be impatient;
PSA.27.14	be entwined as one with the Lord.
PSA.27.14	Be brave and courageous, and never lose hope.
PSA.27.14	Yes, keep on waiting—for he will never disappoint you!
PSA.28.1	I’m pleading with you, Lord, help me!
PSA.28.1	Don’t close your ears to my cry, for you’re my defender.
PSA.28.1	If you continue to remain aloof and refuse to answer me,
PSA.28.1	I might as well give up and die.
PSA.28.2	Can’t you see me turning toward your mercy seat
PSA.28.2	as I lift my hands in surrendered prayer?
PSA.28.2	Now, Lord, please listen to my cry.
PSA.28.3	Don’t allow me to be punished along with the wicked—
PSA.28.3	these hypocrites who speak sweetly to their neighbors’ faces
PSA.28.3	while holding evil against them in their hearts.
PSA.28.4	Go ahead and punish them as they deserve.
PSA.28.4	Let them be paid back for all their evil plans
PSA.28.4	in proportion to their wickedness.
PSA.28.5	Since they don’t care anything about you,
PSA.28.5	or about the great things you’ve done,
PSA.28.5	take them down like an old building being demolished,
PSA.28.5	never again to be rebuilt.
PSA.28.6	But may your name be blessed and built up!
PSA.28.6	For you have answered my passionate cry for mercy.
PSA.28.7	You are my strength and my shield from every danger.
PSA.28.7	When I fully trust in you, help is on the way.
PSA.28.7	I jump for joy and burst forth with ecstatic, passionate praise!
PSA.28.7	I will sing songs of what you mean to me!
PSA.28.8	You will be the inner strength of all your people,
PSA.28.8	the mighty protector of all,
PSA.28.8	the saving strength for all your anointed ones.
PSA.28.9	Keep protecting and cherishing your chosen ones;
PSA.28.9	in you they will never fall.
PSA.28.9	Like a shepherd going before us, keep leading us forward,
PSA.28.9	forever carrying us in your arms!
PSA.29.1	Proclaim his majesty, all you mighty champions,
PSA.29.1	you sons of Almighty God,
PSA.29.1	giving all the glory and strength back to him!
PSA.29.2	Be in awe before his majesty.
PSA.29.2	Be in awe before such power and might!
PSA.29.2	Come worship wonderful Yahweh, arrayed in all his splendor,
PSA.29.2	bowing in worship as he appears in the beauty of holiness.
PSA.29.2	Give him the honor due his name.
PSA.29.2	Worship him wearing the glory-garments
PSA.29.2	of your holy, priestly calling!
PSA.29.3+PSA.29.4	The voice of the Lord echoes through the skies and seas.
PSA.29.3+PSA.29.4	The Glory-God reigns as he thunders in the clouds.
PSA.29.3+PSA.29.4	So powerful is his voice, so brilliant and bright,
PSA.29.3+PSA.29.4	how majestic as he thunders over the great waters!
PSA.29.5	His tympanic thunder topples the strongest of trees.
PSA.29.5	His symphonic sound splinters the mighty forests.
PSA.29.6	Now he moves Zion’s mountains by the might of his voice,
PSA.29.6	shaking the snowy peaks with his earsplitting sound!
PSA.29.7	The lightning-fire flashes, striking as he speaks.
PSA.29.8	God reveals himself when he makes the fault lines quake,
PSA.29.8	shaking deserts, speaking his voice.
PSA.29.9	God’s mighty voice makes the deer to give birth.
PSA.29.9	His thunderbolt voice lays the forest bare.
PSA.29.9	In his temple all fall before him with each one shouting,
PSA.29.9	“Glory, glory, the God of glory!”
PSA.29.10	Above the furious flood, the Enthroned One reigns,
PSA.29.10	the King-God rules with eternity at his side.
PSA.29.11	This is the one who gives his strength and might to his people.
PSA.29.11	This is the Lord giving us his kiss of peace.
PSA.30.1	Lord, I will exalt you and lift you high,
PSA.30.1	for you have lifted me up on high!
PSA.30.1	Over all my boasting, gloating enemies,
PSA.30.1	you made me to triumph.
PSA.30.2	O Lord, my healing God,
PSA.30.2	I cried out for a miracle and you healed me!
PSA.30.3	You brought me back from the brink of death,
PSA.30.3	from the depths below.
PSA.30.3	Now here I am, alive and well, fully restored!
PSA.30.4	O sing and make melody, you steadfast lovers of God.
PSA.30.4	Give thanks to him every time you reflect on his holiness!
PSA.30.5	I’ve learned that his anger lasts for a moment,
PSA.30.5	but his loving favor lasts a lifetime!
PSA.30.5	We may weep through the night,
PSA.30.5	but at daybreak it will turn into shouts of ecstatic joy.
PSA.30.6+PSA.30.7	I remember boasting, “I’ve got it made!
PSA.30.6+PSA.30.7	Nothing can stop me now!
PSA.30.6+PSA.30.7	I’m God’s favored one; he’s made me steady as a mountain!”
PSA.30.6+PSA.30.7	But then suddenly, you hid your face from me.
PSA.30.6+PSA.30.7	I was panic-stricken and became depressed.
PSA.30.8	Still I cried out to you, Lord God. I shouted out for mercy, saying,
PSA.30.9	“What would you gain in my death,
PSA.30.9	if I were to go down to the depths of darkness?
PSA.30.9	Will a grave sing your song?
PSA.30.9	How could death’s dust declare your faithfulness?”
PSA.30.10	So hear me now, Lord; show me your famous mercy.
PSA.30.10	O God, be my Savior and rescue me!
PSA.30.11	Then he broke through and transformed all my wailing
PSA.30.11	into a whirling dance of ecstatic praise!
PSA.30.11	He has torn the veil and lifted from me
PSA.30.11	the sad heaviness of mourning.
PSA.30.11	He wrapped me in the glory garments of gladness.
PSA.30.12	How could I be silent when it’s time to praise you?
PSA.30.12	Now my heart sings out loud, bursting with joy—
PSA.30.12	a bliss inside that keeps me singing,
PSA.30.12	“I can never thank you enough!”
PSA.31.1	I trust you, Lord, to be my hiding place.
PSA.31.1	Don’t let me down.
PSA.31.1	Don’t let my enemies bring me to shame.
PSA.31.1	Come and rescue me, for you are the only God
PSA.31.1	who always does what is right.
PSA.31.2	Rescue me quickly when I cry out to you.
PSA.31.2	At the sound of my prayer may your ear be turned to me.
PSA.31.2	Be my strong shelter and hiding place on high.
PSA.31.2	Pull me into victory and breakthrough.
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	For you are my high fortress, where I’m kept safe.
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	You are to me a stronghold of salvation.
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	When you deliver me out of this peril,
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	it will bring glory to your name.
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	As you guide me forth I’ll be kept safe
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	from the hidden snares of the enemy—
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	the secret traps that lie before me—
PSA.31.3+PSA.31.4	for you have become my rock of strength.
PSA.31.5	Into your hands I now entrust my spirit.
PSA.31.5	O Lord, the God of faithfulness,
PSA.31.5	you have rescued and redeemed me.
PSA.31.6	I despise these deceptive illusions,
PSA.31.6	all this pretense and nonsense,
PSA.31.6	for I worship only you.
PSA.31.7	In mercy you have seen my troubles and you have cared for me;
PSA.31.7	even during this crisis in my soul I will be radiant with joy,
PSA.31.7	filled with praise for your love and mercy.
PSA.31.8	You have kept me from being conquered by my enemy;
PSA.31.8	you broke open the way to bring me to freedom,
PSA.31.8	into a beautiful, broad place.
PSA.31.9	O Lord, help me again! Keep showing me such mercy.
PSA.31.9	For I am in anguish, always in tears,
PSA.31.9	and I’m worn out with weeping.
PSA.31.9	I’m becoming old because of grief; my health is broken.
PSA.31.10	I’m exhausted! My life is spent with sorrow,
PSA.31.10	my years with sighing and sadness.
PSA.31.10	Because of all these troubles, I have no more strength.
PSA.31.10	My inner being is so weak and frail.
PSA.31.11	My enemies say, “You are nothing!”
PSA.31.11	Even my friends and neighbors hold me in contempt!
PSA.31.11	They dread seeing me
PSA.31.11	and they look the other way when I pass by.
PSA.31.12	I am totally forgotten, buried away like a dead man,
PSA.31.12	discarded like a broken dish thrown in the trash.
PSA.31.13	I overheard their whispered threats, the slander of my enemies.
PSA.31.13	I’m terrified as they plot and scheme to take my life.
PSA.31.14	I’m desperate, Lord! I throw myself upon you,
PSA.31.14	for you alone are my God!
PSA.31.15	My life, my every moment, my destiny—it’s all in your hands.
PSA.31.15	So I know you can deliver me
PSA.31.15	from those who persecute me relentlessly.
PSA.31.16	Smile on me, your servant.
PSA.31.16	Let your undying love and glorious grace
PSA.31.16	save me from all this gloom.
PSA.31.17	As I call upon you, let my shame and disgrace
PSA.31.17	be replaced by your favor once again.
PSA.31.17	But let shame and disgrace fall instead upon the wicked—
PSA.31.17	those going to their own doom,
PSA.31.17	drifting down in silence to the dust of death.
PSA.31.18	At last their lying lips will be muted in their graves.
PSA.31.18	For they are arrogant, filled with contempt and conceit
PSA.31.18	as they speak against the godly.
PSA.31.19	Lord, how wonderful you are!
PSA.31.19	You have stored up so many good things for us,
PSA.31.19	like a treasure chest heaped up and spilling over with blessings—
PSA.31.19	all for those who honor and worship you!
PSA.31.19	Everybody knows what you can do
PSA.31.19	for those who turn and hide themselves in you.
PSA.31.20	So hide all your beloved ones
PSA.31.20	in the sheltered, secret place before your face.
PSA.31.20	Overshadow them by your glory-presence.
PSA.31.20	Keep them from these accusations, the brutal insults of evil men.
PSA.31.20	Tuck them safely away in the tabernacle where you dwell.
PSA.31.21	The name of the Lord is blessed and lifted high!
PSA.31.21	For his marvelous miracle of mercy protected me
PSA.31.21	when I was overwhelmed by my enemies.
PSA.31.22	I spoke hastily when I said, “The Lord has deserted me.”
PSA.31.22	For in truth, you did hear my prayer and came to rescue me.
PSA.31.23	Listen to me, all you godly ones: Love the Lord with passion!
PSA.31.23	The Lord protects and preserves all those who are loyal to him.
PSA.31.23	But he pays back in full all those who reject him in their pride.
PSA.31.24	So cheer up! Take courage all you who love him.
PSA.31.24	Wait for him to break through for you, all who trust in him!
PSA.32.1	How happy and fulfilled are those
PSA.32.1	whose rebellion has been forgiven,
PSA.32.1	those whose sins are covered 
PSA.32.2	How blessed and relieved are those
PSA.32.2	who have confessed their corruption to God!
PSA.32.2	For he wipes their slates clean
PSA.32.2	and removes hypocrisy from their hearts.
PSA.32.3	Before I confessed my sins, I kept it all inside;
PSA.32.3	my dishonesty devastated my inner life,
PSA.32.3	causing my life to be filled with frustration,
PSA.32.3	irrepressible anguish, and misery.
PSA.32.4	The pain never let up, for your hand of conviction
PSA.32.4	was heavy on my heart.
PSA.32.4	My strength was sapped, my inner life dried up
PSA.32.4	like a spiritual drought within my soul.
PSA.32.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.32.5	Then I finally admitted to you all my sins,
PSA.32.5	refusing to hide them any longer.
PSA.32.5	I said, “My life-giving God,
PSA.32.5	I will openly acknowledge my evil actions.”
PSA.32.5	And you forgave me!
PSA.32.5	All at once the guilt of my sin washed away
PSA.32.5	and all my pain disappeared!
PSA.32.5	Pause in his presence
PSA.32.6	This is what I’ve learned through it all:
PSA.32.6	All believers should confess their sins to God;
PSA.32.6	do it every time God has uncovered you
PSA.32.6	in the time of exposing.
PSA.32.6	For if you do this, when sudden storms of life overwhelm,
PSA.32.6	you’ll be kept safe.
PSA.32.7	Lord, you are my secret hiding place,
PSA.32.7	protecting me from these troubles,
PSA.32.7	surrounding me with songs of gladness!
PSA.32.7	Your joyous shouts of rescue release my breakthrough.
PSA.32.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	I hear the Lord saying, “I will stay close to you,
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	instructing and guiding you along the pathway for your life.
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	I will advise you along the way
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	and lead you forth with my eyes as your guide.
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	So don’t make it difficult; don’t be stubborn
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	when I take you where you’ve not been before.
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	Don’t make me tug you and pull you along.
PSA.32.8+PSA.32.9	Just come with me!”
PSA.32.10	So my conclusion is this:
PSA.32.10	Many are the sorrows and frustrations
PSA.32.10	of those who don’t come clean with God.
PSA.32.10	But when you trust in the Lord for forgiveness,
PSA.32.10	his wrap-around love will surround you.
PSA.32.11	So celebrate the goodness of God!
PSA.32.11	He shows this kindness to everyone who is his.
PSA.32.11	Go ahead—shout for joy,
PSA.32.11	all you upright ones who want to please him!
PSA.33.1	It’s time to sing and shout for joy!
PSA.33.1	Go ahead, all you redeemed ones, do it!
PSA.33.1	Praise him with all you have,
PSA.33.1	for praise looks lovely on the lips of God’s lovers.
PSA.33.2	Play the guitar as you lift your praises loaded with thanksgiving.
PSA.33.2	Sing and make joyous music with all you’ve got inside.
PSA.33.3	Compose new melodies that release new praises to the Lord.
PSA.33.3	Play his praises on instruments
PSA.33.3	with the anointing and skill he gives you.
PSA.33.3	Sing and shout with passion; make a spectacular sound of joy—
PSA.33.4	For God’s Word is something to sing about!
PSA.33.4	He is true to his promises, his word can be trusted,
PSA.33.4	and everything he does is reliable and right.
PSA.33.5	The Lord loves seeing justice on the earth.
PSA.33.5	Anywhere and everywhere you can find his faithful, unfailing love!
PSA.33.6	All he had to do was speak by his Spirit-wind command,
PSA.33.6	and God created the heavenlies.
PSA.33.6	Filled with galaxies and stars,
PSA.33.6	the vast cosmos he wonderfully made.
PSA.33.7	His voice scooped out the seas.
PSA.33.7	The ocean depths he poured into vast reservoirs.
PSA.33.8	Now, with breathtaking wonder,
PSA.33.8	let everyone worship Yahweh, this awe-inspiring Creator.
PSA.33.9	Words he breathed and worlds were birthed.
PSA.33.9	“Let there be,” and there it was—
PSA.33.9	Springing forth the moment he spoke.
PSA.33.9	No sooner said than done!
PSA.33.10	With his breath he scatters the schemes of nations who oppose him;
PSA.33.10	they will never succeed.
PSA.33.11	His destiny-plan for the earth stands sure.
PSA.33.11	His forever-plan remains in place and will never fail.
PSA.33.12	Blessed and prosperous is that nation who has God as their Lord!
PSA.33.12	They will be the people he has chosen for his own.
PSA.33.13+PSA.33.14+PSA.33.15	The Lord looks over us from where he rules in heaven.
PSA.33.13+PSA.33.14+PSA.33.15	Gazing into every heart from his lofty dwelling place,
PSA.33.13+PSA.33.14+PSA.33.15	he observes all the peoples of the earth.
PSA.33.13+PSA.33.14+PSA.33.15	The Creator of our hearts considers and examines everything we do.
PSA.33.16	Even if a king has the best-equipped army,
PSA.33.16	it would never be enough to save him.
PSA.33.16	Even if the best warrior went to battle,
PSA.33.16	he could not be saved simply by his strength alone.
PSA.33.17	Human strength and the weapons of man
PSA.33.17	are false hopes for victory;
PSA.33.17	they may seem mighty but they will always disappoint.
PSA.33.18	The eyes of the Lord are upon
PSA.33.18	 who love him—
PSA.33.18	those who wait in hope and expectation
PSA.33.18	for the strong, steady love of God.
PSA.33.19	God will deliver them from death,
PSA.33.19	even the certain death of famine, with no one to help.
PSA.33.20	The Lord alone is our radiant hope
PSA.33.20	and we trust in him with all our hearts.
PSA.33.20	His wrap-around presence will strengthen us.
PSA.33.21	As we trust, we rejoice with an uncontained joy
PSA.33.21	flowing from Yahweh!
PSA.33.22	Let your love and steadfast kindness overshadow us
PSA.33.22	continually, for we trust and we wait upon you!
PSA.34.1	Lord! I’m bursting with joy over what you’ve done for me!
PSA.34.1	My lips are full of perpetual praise.
PSA.34.2	I’m boasting of you and all your works,
PSA.34.2	so let all who are discouraged take heart.
PSA.34.3	Join me, everyone! Let’s praise the Lord together.
PSA.34.3	Let’s make him famous!
PSA.34.3	Let’s make his name glorious to all.
PSA.34.4	Listen to my testimony: I cried to God in my distress
PSA.34.4	and he answered me. He freed me from all my fears!
PSA.34.5	Gaze upon him, join your life with his, and joy will come.
PSA.34.5	Your faces will glisten with glory.
PSA.34.5	You’ll never wear that shame-face again.
PSA.34.6	When I had nothing, desperate and defeated,
PSA.34.6	I cried out to the Lord and he heard me,
PSA.34.6	bringing his miracle-deliverance when I needed it most.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the Lord stooped down to listen as I prayed,
PSA.34.7	encircling me, empowering me, and showing me how to escape.
PSA.34.7	He will do this for everyone who fears God.
PSA.34.8	Drink deeply of the pleasures of this God.
PSA.34.8	Experience for yourself the joyous mercies he gives
PSA.34.8	to all who turn to hide themselves in him.
PSA.34.9	Worship in awe and wonder, all you who’ve been made holy!
PSA.34.9	For all who fear him will feast with plenty.
PSA.34.10	Even the strong and the wealthy grow weak and hungry,
PSA.34.10	but those who passionately pursue the Lord
PSA.34.10	will never lack any good thing.
PSA.34.11	Come, children of God, and listen to me.
PSA.34.11	I’ll share the lesson I’ve learned of fearing the Lord.
PSA.34.12+PSA.34.13	Do you want to live a long, good life,
PSA.34.12+PSA.34.13	enjoying the beauty that fills each day?
PSA.34.12+PSA.34.13	Then never speak a lie or allow wicked words
PSA.34.12+PSA.34.13	to come from your mouth.
PSA.34.14	Keep turning your back on every sin,
PSA.34.14	and make “peace” your life motto.
PSA.34.14	Practice being at peace with everyone.
PSA.34.15	The Lord sees all we do;
PSA.34.15	he watches over his friends day and night.
PSA.34.15	His godly ones receive the answers they seek
PSA.34.15	whenever they cry out to him.
PSA.34.16	But the Lord has made up his mind to oppose evildoers
PSA.34.16	and to wipe out even the memory of them
PSA.34.16	from the face of the earth.
PSA.34.17	Yet when holy lovers of God cry out
PSA.34.17	to him with all their hearts,
PSA.34.17	the Lord will hear them and come to rescue them
PSA.34.17	from all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The Lord is close to all whose hearts are crushed by pain,
PSA.34.18	and he is always ready to restore the repentant one.
PSA.34.19	Even when bad things happen to the good and godly ones,
PSA.34.19	the Lord will save them and not let them be defeated
PSA.34.19	by what they face.
PSA.34.20	God will be your bodyguard to protect you
PSA.34.20	when trouble is near.
PSA.34.20	Not one bone will be broken.
PSA.34.21	But the wicked commit slow suicide.
PSA.34.21	For they hate and persecute the lovers of God.
PSA.34.21	Make no mistake about it,
PSA.34.21	God will hold them guilty and punish them;
PSA.34.21	they will pay the penalty!
PSA.34.22	But the Lord has paid for the freedom of his servants,
PSA.34.22	and he will freely pardon those who love him.
PSA.34.22	He will declare them free and innocent
PSA.34.22	when they turn to hide themselves in him.
PSA.35.1	O Lord, fight for me! Harass the hecklers, accuse my accusers.
PSA.35.1	Fight those who fight against me.
PSA.35.2+PSA.35.3	Put on your armor, Lord; take up your shield and protect me.
PSA.35.2+PSA.35.3	Rise up, mighty God! Grab your weapons of war
PSA.35.2+PSA.35.3	and block the way of the wicked who come to fight me.
PSA.35.2+PSA.35.3	Stand for me when they stand against me!
PSA.35.2+PSA.35.3	Speak over my soul: “I am your strong Savior!”
PSA.35.4	Humiliate those who seek my harm. Defeat them all!
PSA.35.4	Frustrate their plans to defeat me and drive them back.
PSA.35.4	Disgrace them all as they have devised their plans to disgrace me.
PSA.35.5	Blow them away like dust in the wind,
PSA.35.5	with the Angel of Almighty God driving them back!
PSA.35.6	Make the road in front of them nothing but slippery darkness,
PSA.35.6	with the Angel of the Lord behind them, chasing them away!
PSA.35.7	For though I did nothing wrong to them, they set a trap for me,
PSA.35.7	wanting me to fall and fail.
PSA.35.8	Surprise them with your ambush, Lord,
PSA.35.8	and catch them in the very trap they set for me.
PSA.35.8	Let them be the ones to fail and fall into destruction!
PSA.35.9	Then my fears will dissolve into limitless joy;
PSA.35.9	my whole being will overflow with gladness
PSA.35.9	because of your mighty deliverance.
PSA.35.10	Everything inside of me will shout it out:
PSA.35.10	“There’s no one like you, Lord!”
PSA.35.10	For look at how you protect the weak and helpless
PSA.35.10	from the strong and heartless who oppress them.
PSA.35.11	They are malicious men, hostile witnesses of wrong.
PSA.35.11	They rise up against me, accusers appearing out of nowhere.
PSA.35.12	When I show them mercy, they bring me misery.
PSA.35.12	I’m forsaken and forlorn, like a motherless child.
PSA.35.13	I even prayed over them when they were sick.
PSA.35.13	I was burdened and bowed low with fasting
PSA.35.13	and interceded for their healing,
PSA.35.13	and I didn’t stop praying.
PSA.35.14	I grieved for them, heavyhearted,
PSA.35.14	as though they were my dearest family members
PSA.35.14	or my good friends who were sick,
PSA.35.14	nearing death, needing prayer.
PSA.35.15	But when I was the one who tripped up and stumbled,
PSA.35.15	they came together to slander me,
PSA.35.15	rejoicing in my time of trouble, tearing me to shreds
PSA.35.15	with their lies and betrayal.
PSA.35.16	These nameless ruffians,
PSA.35.16	mocking me like godless fools at a feast—
PSA.35.16	how they delight in throwing mud on my name.
PSA.35.17	God, how long can you just stand there doing nothing?
PSA.35.17	Now is the time to act.
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from these brutal men,
PSA.35.17	for I am being torn to shreds by these beasts
PSA.35.17	who are out to get me.
PSA.35.17	Save me from their rage, their cruel grasp.
PSA.35.18	Then I will praise you wherever I go.
PSA.35.18	And when everyone gathers for worship,
PSA.35.18	I will lift up your praise with a shout
PSA.35.18	in front of the largest crowd I can find!
PSA.35.19	Don’t let those who fight me for no reason be victorious.
PSA.35.19	Don’t let them succeed, these heartless haters
PSA.35.19	who come against me with their gloating sneers.
PSA.35.20	They are the ones who would never seek peace as friends,
PSA.35.20	for they are ever devising deceit against the innocent ones
PSA.35.20	who mind their own business.
PSA.35.21	They open their mouths with ugly grins,
PSA.35.21	gloating with glee over my every fault.
PSA.35.21	“Look,” they say, “we caught him red-handed!
PSA.35.21	We saw him fall with our own eyes!”
PSA.35.22	But my caring God, you have been there all along.
PSA.35.22	You have seen their hypocrisy.
PSA.35.22	God, don’t let them get away with this.
PSA.35.22	Don’t walk away without doing something.
PSA.35.23	Now is the time to awake! Rise up, Lord!
PSA.35.23	Vindicate me, my Lord and my God!
PSA.35.24	You have every right to judge me, Lord,
PSA.35.24	according to your righteousness,
PSA.35.24	but don’t let them rejoice over me when I stumble.
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	Let them all be ashamed of themselves,
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	humiliated when they rejoice over my every blunder.
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	Shame them, Lord, when they say, “We saw what he did.
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	Now we have him right where we want him.
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	Let’s get him while he’s down!”
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	Make them look ridiculous when they exalt themselves over me.
PSA.35.25+PSA.35.26	May they all be disgraced and dishonored!
PSA.35.27	But let all my true friends shout for joy,
PSA.35.27	all those who know and love what I do for you.
PSA.35.27	Let them all say, “The Lord is great,
PSA.35.27	and he delights in the prosperity of his servant.”
PSA.35.28	Then I won’t be able to hold it in—
PSA.35.28	everyone will hear my joyous praises all day long!
PSA.35.28	Your righteousness will be the theme of my glory-song of praise!
PSA.36.1	The rebellion of sin speaks as an oracle of God,
PSA.36.1	speaking deeply to the conscience of wicked men.
PSA.36.1	,
PSA.36.1	for the fear of God is not before their eyes.
PSA.36.2	See how they flatter themselves,
PSA.36.2	unable to detect and detest their sins.
PSA.36.2	They are crooked and conceited,
PSA.36.2	convinced they can get away with anything.
PSA.36.3	Their wicked words are nothing but lies.
PSA.36.3	Wisdom is far from them.
PSA.36.3	Goodness is both forgotten and forsaken.
PSA.36.4	They lie awake at night to hatch their evil plots,
PSA.36.4	always planning their schemes of darkness,
PSA.36.4	and never once do they consider the evil of their ways.
PSA.36.5	But you, O Lord, your mercy-seat love is limitless,
PSA.36.5	reaching higher than the highest heavens.
PSA.36.5	Your great faithfulness is infinite,
PSA.36.5	stretching over the whole earth.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is unmovable,
PSA.36.6	just like the mighty mountains.
PSA.36.6	Your judgments are as full of wisdom
PSA.36.6	as the oceans are full of water.
PSA.36.6	Your tender care and kindness leave no one forgotten,
PSA.36.6	not a man nor even a mouse.
PSA.36.7	O God, how extravagant is your cherishing love!
PSA.36.7	All mankind can find a hiding place
PSA.36.7	under the shadow of your wings.
PSA.36.8	All may drink of the anointing from the abundance of your house.
PSA.36.8	All may drink their fill from the delightful springs of Eden.
PSA.36.9	To know you is to experience a flowing fountain,
PSA.36.9	drinking in your life, springing up to satisfy.
PSA.36.9	In your light we receive the light of revelation.
PSA.36.10	Lord, keep pouring out your unfailing love
PSA.36.10	on those who are near you.
PSA.36.10	Release more of your blessings to those who are loyal to you.
PSA.36.11	Don’t let these proud boasters trample me down;
PSA.36.11	don’t let them push me around
PSA.36.11	by the sheer strength of their wickedness.
PSA.36.12	There they lie in the dirt, these evil ones,
PSA.36.12	thrown down to the ground, never to arise again!
PSA.37.1	Don’t follow after the wicked ones or be jealous of their wealth.
PSA.37.1	Don’t think for a moment they’re better off than you.
PSA.37.2	They 
PSA.37.2	will soon shrivel up and quickly fade away
PSA.37.2	like grass clippings in the hot sun.
PSA.37.3	Keep trusting in the Lord and do what is right in his eyes.
PSA.37.3	Fix your heart on the promises of God and you will be secure,
PSA.37.3	feasting on his faithfulness.
PSA.37.4	Make God the utmost delight and pleasure of your life,
PSA.37.4	and he will provide for you what you desire the most.
PSA.37.5	Give God the right to direct your life,
PSA.37.5	and as you trust him along the way
PSA.37.5	you’ll find he pulled it off perfectly!
PSA.37.6	He will appear as your righteousness,
PSA.37.6	as sure as the dawning of a new day.
PSA.37.6	He will manifest as your justice,
PSA.37.6	as sure and strong as the noonday sun.
PSA.37.7	Quiet your heart in his presence and pray;
PSA.37.7	keep hope alive as you long for God to come through for you.
PSA.37.7	And don’t think for a moment that the wicked in their prosperity
PSA.37.7	are better off than you.
PSA.37.8	Stay away from anger and revenge.
PSA.37.8	Keep envy far from you, for it only leads you into lies.
PSA.37.9	For one day the wicked will be destroyed,
PSA.37.9	but those who trust in the Lord
PSA.37.9	will live safe and sound with blessings overflowing.
PSA.37.10	Just a little while longer and the ungodly will vanish;
PSA.37.10	you will look for them in vain.
PSA.37.11	But the humble of heart will inherit every promise
PSA.37.11	and enjoy abundant peace.
PSA.37.12	Let the wicked keep plotting against the godly
PSA.37.12	with all their sneers and arrogant jeers.
PSA.37.13	God doesn’t lose any sleep over them
PSA.37.13	and he knows their day is coming!
PSA.37.14	Evil ones take aim on the poor and helpless;
PSA.37.14	they are ready to slaughter those who do right.
PSA.37.15	But the Lord will turn all their weapons of wickedness back on themselves,
PSA.37.15	piercing their pride-filled hearts until they are the helpless.
PSA.37.16	It is much better to have little
PSA.37.16	combined with much of God
PSA.37.16	than to have the fabulous wealth of the wicked and nothing else.
PSA.37.17	For the Lord takes care of all his forgiven ones
PSA.37.17	while the strength of the evil will surely slip away.
PSA.37.18	Day by day the Lord watches the good deeds of the godly
PSA.37.18	and he prepares for them his forever-reward.
PSA.37.19	Even in a time of disaster he will watch over them,
PSA.37.19	and they will always have more than enough
PSA.37.19	no matter what happens.
PSA.37.20	All the enemies of God will perish.
PSA.37.20	For the wicked have only a momentary value, a fading glory.
PSA.37.20	Then one day they vanish! Here today, gone tomorrow.
PSA.37.21	They break their promises, borrowing money
PSA.37.21	but never paying it back.
PSA.37.21	The good man returns what he owes with some extra besides.
PSA.37.22	The Lord’s blessed ones receive it all in the end,
PSA.37.22	but the cursed ones will be cut off
PSA.37.22	with nothing to show for themselves.
PSA.37.23	The steps of the God-pursuing ones
PSA.37.23	follow firmly in the footsteps of the Lord,
PSA.37.23	and God delights in every step they take to follow him.
PSA.37.24	If they stumble badly they will still survive,
PSA.37.24	for the Lord lifts them up with his hands.
PSA.37.25	I was once young, but now I’m old.
PSA.37.25	Not once have I found a lover of God forsaken by him,
PSA.37.25	nor have any of their children gone hungry.
PSA.37.26	Instead, I’ve found the godly ones
PSA.37.26	to be the generous ones who give freely to others.
PSA.37.26	Their children are blessed and become a blessing.
PSA.37.27	If you truly want to dwell forever in God’s presence,
PSA.37.27	forsake evil and do what is right in his eyes.
PSA.37.28	The Lord loves it when he sees us walking in his justice.
PSA.37.28	He will never desert his devoted lovers;
PSA.37.28	they will be kept forever in his faithful care.
PSA.37.28	But the descendants of the wicked will be banished.
PSA.37.29	The faithful lovers of God will inherit the earth
PSA.37.29	and enjoy every promise of God’s care,
PSA.37.29	dwelling in peace forever.
PSA.37.30	God-lovers make the best counselors.
PSA.37.30	Their words possess wisdom and are right and trustworthy.
PSA.37.31	The ways of God are in their hearts
PSA.37.31	and they won’t swerve from the paths of steadfast righteousness.
PSA.37.32	Evil ones spy on the godly ones, stalking them
PSA.37.32	to find something they could use to accuse them.
PSA.37.32	They’re out for the kill!
PSA.37.33	But God will foil all their plots.
PSA.37.33	The godly will not stand condemned when brought to trial.
PSA.37.34	So don’t be impatient for the Lord to act;
PSA.37.34	keep moving forward steadily in his ways,
PSA.37.34	and he will exalt you 
PSA.37.34	And when he does, you will possess every promise,
PSA.37.34	including your full inheritance.
PSA.37.34	You’ll watch with your own eyes
PSA.37.34	and see the wicked lose everything.
PSA.37.35	I’ve already seen this happen.
PSA.37.35	Once I saw a wicked and violent man
PSA.37.35	overpower all who were around him,
PSA.37.35	a domineering tyrant with his pride and oppressive ways.
PSA.37.36	Then he died and was forgotten.
PSA.37.36	Now no one cares that he is gone forever.
PSA.37.37	But you can tell who are the blameless and spiritually mature.
PSA.37.37	The godly ones will have a peaceful, prosperous future
PSA.37.37	with a happy ending.
PSA.37.38	Every evil sinner will be destroyed, obliterated.
PSA.37.38	They’ll be utter failures with no future!
PSA.37.39	But the Lord will be the Savior of all who love him.
PSA.37.39	Even in their time of trouble God will live in them as strength.
PSA.37.40	Because of their faith in him, their daily portion will be
PSA.37.40	a Father’s help and deliverance from evil.
PSA.37.40	This is true for all who turn to hide themselves in him!
PSA.38.1	O Lord, don’t punish me angrily for what I’ve done.
PSA.38.1	Don’t let my sin inflame your wrath against me.
PSA.38.2	For the arrows of your conviction have pierced me deeply.
PSA.38.2	Your blows have struck my soul and crushed me.
PSA.38.3	Now my body is sick.
PSA.38.3	My health is totally broken because of your anger,
PSA.38.3	and it’s all due to my sins!
PSA.38.4	I’m overwhelmed, swamped, and submerged
PSA.38.4	beneath the heavy burden of my guilt.
PSA.38.4	It clings to me and won’t let me go.
PSA.38.5	My rotting wounds are a witness against me.
PSA.38.5	They are severe and getting worse,
PSA.38.5	reminding me of my failure and folly.
PSA.38.6	I am completely broken because of what I’ve done.
PSA.38.6	Gloom is all around me.
PSA.38.6	My sins have bent me over to the ground.
PSA.38.7+PSA.38.8	My inner being is shriveled up;
PSA.38.7+PSA.38.8	my self-confidence crushed.
PSA.38.7+PSA.38.8	Sick with fever, I’m left exhausted.
PSA.38.7+PSA.38.8	Now I’m cold as a corpse and nothing is left inside me
PSA.38.7+PSA.38.8	but great groaning filled with anguish.
PSA.38.9	Lord, you know all my desires and deepest longings.
PSA.38.9	My tears are liquid words and you can read them all.
PSA.38.10+PSA.38.11	My heart beats wildly, my strength is sapped,
PSA.38.10+PSA.38.11	and the light of my eyes is going out.
PSA.38.10+PSA.38.11	My friends stay far away from me, avoiding me like the plague.
PSA.38.10+PSA.38.11	Even my family wants nothing to do with me.
PSA.38.12	Meanwhile my enemies are out to kill me,
PSA.38.12	plotting my ruin, speaking of my doom
PSA.38.12	as they spend every waking moment
PSA.38.12	planning how to finish me off.
PSA.38.13+PSA.38.14	I’m like a deaf man who no longer hears.
PSA.38.13+PSA.38.14	I can’t even speak up, and words fail me;
PSA.38.13+PSA.38.14	I have no argument to counter their threats.
PSA.38.15	Lord, the only thing I can do is wait and put my hope in you.
PSA.38.15	I wait for your help, my God.
PSA.38.16	So hear my cry and put an end to their strutting in pride,
PSA.38.16	who gloat when I stumble in pain.
PSA.38.17	I’m slipping away and on the verge of a breakdown,
PSA.38.17	with nothing but sorrow and sighing.
PSA.38.18	I confess all my sin to you; I can’t hold it in any longer.
PSA.38.18	My agonizing thoughts punish me for my wrongdoing;
PSA.38.18	I feel condemned as I consider all I’ve done.
PSA.38.19	My enemies are many.
PSA.38.19	They hate me and persecute me,
PSA.38.19	though I’ve done nothing against them to deserve it.
PSA.38.20	I show goodness to them and get repaid evil in return.
PSA.38.20	And they hate me even more when I stand for what is right.
PSA.38.21	So don’t forsake me now, Lord!
PSA.38.21	Don’t leave me in this condition.
PSA.38.22	God, hurry to help me, run to my rescue!
PSA.38.22	For you’re my Savior and my only hope!
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	Here’s my life motto, the truth I live by:
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	I will guard my ways for all my days.
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	I will speak only what is right, guarding what I speak.
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	Like a watchman guards against an attack of the enemy,
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	I’ll guard and muzzle my mouth
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	when the wicked are around me.
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	I will remain silent and will not grumble
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	or speak out of my disappointment.
PSA.39.1+PSA.39.2	But the longer I’m silent the more my pain grows worse!
PSA.39.3+PSA.39.4	My heart burned with a fire within me,
PSA.39.3+PSA.39.4	and my thoughts eventually boiled over
PSA.39.3+PSA.39.4	until they finally came rolling out of my mouth.
PSA.39.3+PSA.39.4	“Lord, help me to know how fleeting my time on earth is.
PSA.39.3+PSA.39.4	Help me to know how limited is my life
PSA.39.3+PSA.39.4	and that I’m only here but for a moment more.
PSA.39.5	What a brief time you’ve given me to live!
PSA.39.5	Compared to you my lifetime is nothing at all!
PSA.39.5	Nothing more than a puff of air, I’m gone so swiftly.
PSA.39.5	So too are the grandest of men;
PSA.39.5	they are nothing but a fleeting shadow!”
PSA.39.5	Pause in his presence
PSA.39.6	We live our lives like those living in shadows.
PSA.39.6	All our activities and energies are spent for things that pass away.
PSA.39.6	We gather, we hoard, we cling to our things,
PSA.39.6	only to leave them all behind for who knows who.
PSA.39.7	And now, God, I’m left with one conclusion:
PSA.39.7	my only hope is to hope in you alone!
PSA.39.8	Save me from being overpowered by my sin;
PSA.39.8	don’t make me a disgrace before the degenerate.
PSA.39.9	Lord, I’m left speechless and I have no excuse,
PSA.39.9	so I’ll not complain any longer.
PSA.39.9	Now I know you’re the one who is behind it all.
PSA.39.10	But I can’t take it much longer.
PSA.39.10	Spare me these blows from your discipline-rod.
PSA.39.10	For if you are against me, I will waste away to nothing.
PSA.39.11	No one endures when you rebuke and discipline us for our sins.
PSA.39.11	Like a cobweb is swept away with a wave of the hand,
PSA.39.11	you sweep away all that we once called dear.
PSA.39.11	How fleeting and frail our lives!
PSA.39.11	We’re nothing more than a puff of air.
PSA.39.11	Pause in his presence
PSA.39.12	Lord, listen to all my tender cries.
PSA.39.12	Read my every tear, like liquid words that plead for your help.
PSA.39.12	I feel all alone at times, like a stranger to you,
PSA.39.12	passing through this life just like all those before me.
PSA.39.13	Don’t let me die without restoring
PSA.39.13	joy and gladness to my soul.
PSA.39.13	May your frown over my failure
PSA.39.13	become a smile over my success.
PSA.40.1	I waited and waited and waited some more,
PSA.40.1	patiently, knowing God would come through for me.
PSA.40.1	Then, at last, he bent down and listened to my cry.
PSA.40.2	He stooped down to lift me out of danger
PSA.40.2	from the desolate pit I was in,
PSA.40.2	out of the muddy mess I had fallen into.
PSA.40.2	Now he’s lifted me up into a firm, secure place
PSA.40.2	and steadied me while I walk along his ascending path.
PSA.40.3	A new song for a new day rises up in me
PSA.40.3	every time I think about how he breaks through for me!
PSA.40.3	Ecstatic praise pours out of my mouth until
PSA.40.3	everyone hears how God has set me free.
PSA.40.3	Many will see his miracles;
PSA.40.3	they’ll stand in awe of God and fall in love with him!
PSA.40.4	Blessing after blessing comes to those who love and trust the Lord.
PSA.40.4	They will not fall away,
PSA.40.4	for they refuse to listen to the lies of the proud.
PSA.40.5	O Lord, our God, no one can compare with you.
PSA.40.5	Such wonderful works and miracles are all found with you!
PSA.40.5	And you think of us all the time
PSA.40.5	with your countless expressions of love—
PSA.40.5	far exceeding our expectations!
PSA.40.6	It’s not sacrifices that really move your heart.
PSA.40.6	Burnt offerings, sin offerings—that’s not what brings you joy.
PSA.40.6	But when you open my ears and speak deeply to me,
PSA.40.6	I become your willing servant, your prisoner of love for life.
PSA.40.7	So I said, “Here I am! I’m coming 
PSA.40.7	for in the prophetic scrolls of your book
PSA.40.7	you have written about me.
PSA.40.8	I delight to fulfill your will, my God,
PSA.40.8	for your living words are written upon the pages of my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I tell everyone everywhere the truth of your righteousness.
PSA.40.9	And you know I haven’t held back in telling the message to all.
PSA.40.10	I don’t keep it a secret or hide the truth.
PSA.40.10	I preach of your faithfulness and kindness,
PSA.40.10	proclaiming your extravagant love to the largest crowd I can find!
PSA.40.11	So Lord, don’t hold back your love or withhold
PSA.40.11	your tender mercies from me.
PSA.40.11	Keep me in your truth and let your compassion overflow to me
PSA.40.11	no matter what I face.
PSA.40.12	Evil surrounds me; problems greater than I can solve
PSA.40.12	come one after another.
PSA.40.12	Without you, I know I can’t make it.
PSA.40.12	My sins are so many!
PSA.40.12	I’m so ashamed to lift my face to you.
PSA.40.12	For my guilt grabs me and stings my soul
PSA.40.12	until I am weakened and spent.
PSA.40.13	Please, Lord! Come quickly and rescue me!
PSA.40.13	Take pleasure in showing me your favor and restore me.
PSA.40.14	Let all who seek my life be humiliated!
PSA.40.14	Let them be confused and ashamed, God.
PSA.40.14	Scatter those who wish me evil; they just want me dead.
PSA.40.15	Scoff at every scoffer and cause them all to be utter failures.
PSA.40.15	Let them be ashamed and horrified by their complete defeat.
PSA.40.16	But let all who passionately seek you
PSA.40.16	erupt with excitement and joy over what you’ve done!
PSA.40.16	Let all your lovers rejoice continually in the Savior, saying,
PSA.40.16	“How great and glorious is our God!”
PSA.40.17	Lord, in my place of weakness and need, I ask again:
PSA.40.17	Will you come and help me?
PSA.40.17	I know I’m always in your thoughts.
PSA.40.17	You are my true Savior and hero,
PSA.40.17	so don’t delay to deliver me now, for you are my God.
PSA.41.1	God always blesses those who are kind to the poor and helpless.
PSA.41.1	They’re the first ones God helps
PSA.41.1	when they find themselves in any trouble.
PSA.41.2	The Lord will preserve and protect them.
PSA.41.2	They’ll be honored and esteemed
PSA.41.2	while their enemies are defeated.
PSA.41.3	When they are sick, God will restore them,
PSA.41.3	lying upon their bed of suffering.
PSA.41.3	He will raise them up again and restore them back to health.
PSA.41.4	So 
PSA.41.4	“Lord, be my kind healer.
PSA.41.4	Heal my body and soul; heal me, God!
PSA.41.4	For I have confessed my sins to you.”
PSA.41.5	But those who hate me wish the worst for me, saying,
PSA.41.5	“When will he die and be forgotten?”
PSA.41.6	And when these “friends” come to visit me
PSA.41.6	with their pious sympathy and their hollow words
PSA.41.6	and with hypocrisy hidden in their hearts,
PSA.41.6	I can see right through it all.
PSA.41.6	For they come merely to gather gossip about me,
PSA.41.6	using all they find to mock me with malicious hearts of slander.
PSA.41.7	They are wicked whisperers who imagine the worst for me,
PSA.41.7	repeating their rumors, saying,
PSA.41.8	“He got what he deserved; it’s over for him!
PSA.41.8	The spirit of infirmity is upon him
PSA.41.8	and he’ll never get over this illness.”
PSA.41.9	Even my ally, my friend, has turned against me.
PSA.41.9	He was one I totally trusted with my life,
PSA.41.9	sharing supper with him,
PSA.41.9	and now he shows me nothing but betrayal and treachery.
PSA.41.9	He has sold me as an enemy.
PSA.41.10	So Lord, please don’t desert me when I need you!
PSA.41.10	Give me grace and get me back on my feet
PSA.41.10	so I can triumph over them all.
PSA.41.11	Then I’ll know you’re pleased with me
PSA.41.11	when you allow me to taste of victory over all my foes.
PSA.41.12	Now stand up for me and don’t let me fall,
PSA.41.12	for I’ve walked with integrity.
PSA.41.12	Keep me before your face forever.
PSA.41.13	Everyone praise the Lord God of Israel, always and forever!
PSA.41.13	For he is from eternity past
PSA.41.13	and will remain for the eternity to come.
PSA.41.13	That’s the way it will be forever.
PSA.41.13	Faithful is our King! Amen!
PSA.42.1	I long to drink of you, O God,
PSA.42.1	flowing from your presence.
PSA.42.1	My longings overwhelm me for more of you!
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts, pants, and longs for the living God.
PSA.42.2	I want to come and see the face of God.
PSA.42.3	Day and night my tears keep falling
PSA.42.3	and my heart keeps crying for your help
PSA.42.3	while my enemies mock me over and over, saying,
PSA.42.3	“Where is this God of yours? 
PSA.42.4	So I speak over my heartbroken soul,
PSA.42.4	“Take courage. Remember when you used to be
PSA.42.4	right out front leading the procession of praise
PSA.42.4	when the great crowd of worshipers
PSA.42.4	gathered to go into the presence of the Lord?
PSA.42.4	You shouted with joy as the sound of passionate celebration
PSA.42.4	filled the air and the joyous multitude of lovers
PSA.42.4	honored the festival of the Lord!”
PSA.42.5	So then, my soul, why would you be depressed?
PSA.42.5	Why would you sink into despair?
PSA.42.5	Just keep hoping and waiting on God, your Savior.
PSA.42.5	For no matter what, I will still sing with praise,
PSA.42.5	for living before his face is my saving grace!
PSA.42.6	Here I am depressed and downcast.
PSA.42.6	Yet I will still remember you as I ponder the place
PSA.42.6	where your glory streams down from the mighty mountaintops, lofty and majestic—
PSA.42.7	My deep need calls out to the deep kindness of your love.
PSA.42.7	Your waterfall of weeping sent waves of sorrow
PSA.42.7	over my soul, carrying me away,
PSA.42.7	cascading over me like a thundering cataract.
PSA.42.8	Yet all day long God’s promises of love pour over me.
PSA.42.8	Through the night I sing his songs,
PSA.42.8	for my prayer to God has become my life.
PSA.42.9	I will say to God, “You are my mountain of strength;
PSA.42.9	how could you forget me?
PSA.42.9	Why must I suffer this vile oppression of my enemies—
PSA.42.9	these heartless tormentors who are out to kill me?”
PSA.42.10	Their wounding words pierce my heart
PSA.42.10	over and over while they say,
PSA.42.10	“Where is this God of yours?”
PSA.42.11	So I say to my soul,
PSA.42.11	“Don’t be discouraged. Don’t be disturbed.
PSA.42.11	For I know my God will break through for me.”
PSA.42.11	Then I’ll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over again.
PSA.42.11	Yes, living before his face is my saving grace!
PSA.43.1	God, clear my name.
PSA.43.1	Plead my case against the unjust charges
PSA.43.1	of these ungodly workers of wickedness.
PSA.43.1	Deliver me from these lying degenerates.
PSA.43.2	For you are where my strength comes from and my protector,
PSA.43.2	so why would you leave me now?
PSA.43.2	Must I be covered with gloom
PSA.43.2	while the enemy comes after me, gloating with glee?
PSA.43.3	Pour into me the brightness of your daybreak!
PSA.43.3	Pour into me your rays of revelation-truth!
PSA.43.3	Let them comfort and gently lead me onto the shining path,
PSA.43.3	showing the way into your burning presence,
PSA.43.3	into your many sanctuaries of holiness.
PSA.43.4	Then I will come closer to your very altar
PSA.43.4	until I come before you, the God of my ecstatic joy!
PSA.43.4	I will praise you with the harp that plays in my heart,
PSA.43.4	to you, my God, my magnificent God!
PSA.43.5	Then I will say to my soul,
PSA.43.5	“Don’t be discouraged; don’t be disturbed,
PSA.43.5	for I fully expect my Savior-God to break through for me.
PSA.43.5	Then I’ll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over again.”
PSA.43.5	Yes, living before his face is my saving grace!
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	God, we’ve heard about all the glorious miracles
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	you’ve done for our ancestors in days gone by.
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	They told us about the ancient times, how by your power
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	you drove out the ungodly nations from this land,
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	crushing all their strongholds and giving the land to us.
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	Now the people of Israel cover the land
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	from one end to the other,
PSA.44.1+PSA.44.2	!
PSA.44.3	Our forefathers didn’t win these battles by their own strength
PSA.44.3	or their own skill or strategy.
PSA.44.3	But it was through the shining forth of your radiantpresence
PSA.44.3	and the display of your mighty power.
PSA.44.3	You loved to give them victory,
PSA.44.3	for you took great delight in them.
PSA.44.4	You are my God, my King!
PSA.44.4	It’s now time to decree majesties for Jacob!
PSA.44.5	Through your glorious name and your awesome power
PSA.44.5	we can push through to any victory and defeat every enemy.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in the weapons of the world;
PSA.44.6	I know they will never save me.
PSA.44.7	Only you will be our Savior from all our enemies.
PSA.44.7	All those who hate us you have brought to shame.
PSA.44.8	So now I constantly boast in you.
PSA.44.8	I can never thank you enough!
PSA.44.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.44.9	But you have turned your back on us; you walked off and left us!
PSA.44.9	You’ve rejected us, tossing us aside in humiliating shame.
PSA.44.9	You don’t go before us anymore in our battles.
PSA.44.10	We retreat before our enemies in defeat,
PSA.44.10	for you are no longer helping us.
PSA.44.10	Those who hate us have invaded our land
PSA.44.10	and plundered our people.
PSA.44.11	You have treated us like sheep in the slaughter pen,
PSA.44.11	ready to be butchered.
PSA.44.11	You’ve scattered us to the four winds.
PSA.44.12	You have sold us as slaves for nothing!
PSA.44.12	You have counted us, your precious ones, as worthless.
PSA.44.13	You have caused our neighbors to despise and scorn us.
PSA.44.13	All that are around us mock and curse us.
PSA.44.14	You have made us the butt of their jokes.
PSA.44.14	Disliked by all, we are the laughingstock of the people.
PSA.44.15+PSA.44.16	There’s no escape from this constant curse, this humiliation!
PSA.44.15+PSA.44.16	We are despised, jeered, overwhelmed by shame,
PSA.44.15+PSA.44.16	and overcome at every turn
PSA.44.15+PSA.44.16	by our hateful and heartless enemies.
PSA.44.17	Despite all of this, we have not forgotten you;
PSA.44.17	we have not broken covenant with you.
PSA.44.18	We have not betrayed you; our hearts are still yours.
PSA.44.18	Our steps have not strayed from your path.
PSA.44.19	Yet you have crushed us,
PSA.44.19	leaving us in this wilderness place 
PSA.44.19	With nowhere else to turn,
PSA.44.19	death’s dark door seems to be the only way out.
PSA.44.20+PSA.44.21	If we had forsaken your holy name, wouldn’t you know it?
PSA.44.20+PSA.44.21	You’d be right in leaving us.
PSA.44.20+PSA.44.21	If we had worshiped before other gods,
PSA.44.20+PSA.44.21	no one would blame you for punishing us.
PSA.44.20+PSA.44.21	God, you know our every heart secret.
PSA.44.22	Because of you we face death threats every day.
PSA.44.22	Like martyrs we are dying daily.
PSA.44.22	We are seen as lambs lined up to be slaughtered as sacrifices.
PSA.44.23	So wake up, Lord God!
PSA.44.23	Why would you sleep when we’re in trouble?
PSA.44.23	Are you forsaking us forever?
PSA.44.24	You can’t hide your face any longer from us!
PSA.44.24	How could you forget our agonizing sorrow?
PSA.44.25	Now we lay facedown, sinking into the dust of death,
PSA.44.25	the quicksand of the grave.
PSA.44.26	Arise, awake, and come to help us, O Lord.
PSA.44.26	Let your unfailing love save us from this sorrow!
PSA.45.1	My heart is on fire, boiling over with passion.
PSA.45.1	Bubbling up within me are these beautiful lyrics
PSA.45.1	as a lovely poem to be sung for the King.
PSA.45.1	Like a river bursting its banks, I’m overflowing with words,
PSA.45.1	spilling out into this sacred story.
PSA.45.2	Beautiful! Beautiful! Beyond the sons of men!
PSA.45.2	Elegant grace pours out through every word you speak.
PSA.45.2	Truly God has anointed you, his favored one, for eternity!
PSA.45.3	Now strap your lightning-sword of judgment upon your side,
PSA.45.3	O mighty warrior, so majestic!
PSA.45.3	You are full of beauty and splendor as you go out to war!
PSA.45.4	In your glory and grandeur go forth in victory!
PSA.45.4	Through your faithfulness and meekness
PSA.45.4	the cause of truth and justice will stand.
PSA.45.4	Awe-inspiring miracles are accomplished by your power,
PSA.45.4	leaving everyone dazed and astonished!
PSA.45.5	Your wounding leaves men’s hearts defeated
PSA.45.5	as they fall before you broken.
PSA.45.6	Your glory-kingdom, O God, endures forever,
PSA.45.6	for you are enthroned to rule with a justice-scepter in your hand!
PSA.45.7	You are passionate for righteousness and you hate lawlessness.
PSA.45.7	This is why God, your God,
PSA.45.7	crowns you with bliss above your fellow kings.
PSA.45.7	He has anointed you, more than any other,
PSA.45.7	with his oil of fervent joy,
PSA.45.7	the very fragrance of heaven’s gladness.
PSA.45.8	Your royal robes release the scent of suffering love for your bride;
PSA.45.8	the odor of aromatic incense is upon you.
PSA.45.8	From the pure and shining place, lovely music
PSA.45.8	that makes you glad is played for your pleasure.
PSA.45.9	The daughters of kings, women of honor,
PSA.45.9	are maidens in your courts.
PSA.45.9	And standing beside you,
PSA.45.9	glistening in your pure and golden glory,
PSA.45.9	is the beautiful bride-to-be!
PSA.45.10	Now listen, daughter, pay attention, and forget about your past.
PSA.45.10	Put behind you every attachment to the familiar,
PSA.45.10	even those who once were close to you!
PSA.45.11	For your royal Bridegroom is ravished by your beautiful brightness.
PSA.45.11	Bow in reverence before him, for he is your Lord!
PSA.45.12	Wedding presents pour in from those of great wealth.
PSA.45.12	The royal friends of the Bridegroom shower you with gifts.
PSA.45.13	As the princess bride enters the palace,
PSA.45.13	how glorious she appears within the holy chamber,
PSA.45.13	robed with a wedding dress embroidered with pure gold!
PSA.45.14	Lovely and stunning she leads the procession with all her bridesmaids
PSA.45.14	as they come before you, her Bridegroom King.
PSA.45.15	What a grand, majestic entrance!
PSA.45.15	A joyful, glad procession as they enter the palace gates!
PSA.45.16	Your many sons will one day be kings, just like their Father.
PSA.45.16	They will sit on royal thrones all around the world.
PSA.45.17	I will make sure the fame of your name
PSA.45.17	is honored in every generation as all the people praise you,
PSA.45.17	giving you thanks forever and ever!
PSA.46.1	God, you’re such a safe and powerful place to find refuge!
PSA.46.1	You’re a proven help in time of trouble—
PSA.46.1	 and always available whenever I need you.
PSA.46.2	So we will never fear
PSA.46.2	even if every structure of support were to crumble away.
PSA.46.2	We will not fear even when the earth quakes and shakes,
PSA.46.2	moving mountains and casting them into the sea.
PSA.46.3	For the raging roar of stormy winds and crashing waves
PSA.46.3	cannot erode our faith in you.
PSA.46.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.46.4	God has a constantly flowing river whose sparkling streams
PSA.46.4	bring joy and delight to his people.
PSA.46.4	His river flows right through the city of God Most High,
PSA.46.4	into his holy dwelling places.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of his city, secure and never shaken.
PSA.46.5	At daybreak his help will be seen with the appearing of the dawn.
PSA.46.6	When the nations are in uproar with their tottering kingdoms,
PSA.46.6	God simply raises his voice
PSA.46.6	and the earth begins to disintegrate before him.
PSA.46.7	!
PSA.46.7	The Commander!
PSA.46.7	The mighty Lord of Angel Armies is on our side.
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob fights for us!
PSA.46.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.46.8+PSA.46.9	Everyone look!
PSA.46.8+PSA.46.9	Come and see the breathtaking wonders of our God.
PSA.46.8+PSA.46.9	For he brings 
PSA.46.8+PSA.46.9	He’s the one who makes conflicts end
PSA.46.8+PSA.46.9	throughout the earth,
PSA.46.8+PSA.46.9	breaking and burning every weapon of war.
PSA.46.10	Surrender your anxiety!
PSA.46.10	Be silent and stop your striving and you will see that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I am the God above all the nations,
PSA.46.10	and I will be exalted throughout the whole earth.
PSA.46.11	Here he stands!
PSA.46.11	The Commander!
PSA.46.11	The mighty Lord of Angel Armies is on our side!
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob fights for us!
PSA.46.11	Pause in his presence
PSA.47.1	Go ahead and celebrate!
PSA.47.1	Come on and clap your hands, everyone!
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with the raucous sounds of joy!
PSA.47.2	The Lord God Most High is astonishing, awesome beyond words!
PSA.47.2	He’s the formidable and powerful King over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He’s the one who conquered the nations before us
PSA.47.3	and placed them all under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He’s marked out our inheritance ahead of time,
PSA.47.4	putting us in the front of the line, honoring Jacob, the one he loves.
PSA.47.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.47.5	God arises with the earsplitting shout of his people!
PSA.47.5	God goes up with a trumpet blast!
PSA.47.6	Sing and celebrate! Sing some more, celebrate some more!
PSA.47.6	Sing your highest song of praise to our King!
PSA.47.7	For God is the triumphant King; the powers of earth are all his.
PSA.47.7	So sing your celebration songs of highest praise
PSA.47.7	to the glorious Enlightened One!
PSA.47.8	Our God reigns over every nation.
PSA.47.8	He reigns on his holy throne over all.
PSA.47.9	All the nobles and princes,
PSA.47.9	the loving servants of the God of Abraham,
PSA.47.9	they all gather to worship.
PSA.47.9	Every warrior’s shield is now lowered
PSA.47.9	as surrendered trophies before this King.
PSA.47.9	He has taken his throne, high and lofty, exalted over all!
PSA.48.1	There are so many reasons to describe God as wonderful!
PSA.48.1	So many reasons to praise him with unlimited praise!
PSA.48.2	Zion-City is his home; he lives on his holy mountain—
PSA.48.2	high and glorious, joy filled and favored.
PSA.48.2	Zion-Mountain looms in the farthest reaches of the north,
PSA.48.2	the city of our incomparable King!
PSA.48.3	This is his divine abode, an impenetrable citadel,
PSA.48.3	for he is known to dwell in the highest place.
PSA.48.4+PSA.48.5+PSA.48.6	See how the mighty kings united to come against Zion,
PSA.48.4+PSA.48.5+PSA.48.6	yet when they saw God manifest in front of their eyes,
PSA.48.4+PSA.48.5+PSA.48.6	they were stunned.
PSA.48.4+PSA.48.5+PSA.48.6	Trembling, they all fled away, gripped with fear.
PSA.48.4+PSA.48.5+PSA.48.6	Seized with panic, they doubled up in frightful anguish
PSA.48.4+PSA.48.5+PSA.48.6	like a woman in the labor pains of childbirth.
PSA.48.7	Like a hurricane blowing and breaking the invading ships,
PSA.48.7	God blows upon them and breaks them to pieces.
PSA.48.8	We have heard about these wonders,
PSA.48.8	and then we saw them with our own eyes.
PSA.48.8	For this is the city of the Commander of Angel Armies,
PSA.48.8	the city of our God, safe and secure forever!
PSA.48.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.48.9	Lord, as we worship you in your temple,
PSA.48.9	we recall over and over your kindness to us
PSA.48.9	and your unending love.
PSA.48.10	The fame of your name echoes throughout the entire world,
PSA.48.10	accompanied with praises.
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of victory.
PSA.48.11	So let the people of Zion rejoice with gladness;
PSA.48.11	let the daughters of praise leap for joy!
PSA.48.11	For God will see to it that you are judged fairly.
PSA.48.12+PSA.48.13	Circle Zion; count her towers.
PSA.48.12+PSA.48.13	Consider her walls, climb her palaces,
PSA.48.12+PSA.48.13	and then go and tell the coming generation
PSA.48.12+PSA.48.13	of the care and compassion of our God.
PSA.48.14	Yes, this is our God, our great God forever.
PSA.48.14	He will lead us onward until the end,
PSA.48.14	through all time, beyond death,
PSA.48.14	and into eternity!
PSA.49.1+PSA.49.2	Listen, one and all!
PSA.49.1+PSA.49.2	Both rich and poor together, all over the world—
PSA.49.1+PSA.49.2	everyone listen to what I have to say!
PSA.49.3	For wisdom will come from my mouth;
PSA.49.3	words of insight and understanding will be heard
PSA.49.3	from the musings of my heart.
PSA.49.4	I will break open mysteries with my music,
PSA.49.4	and my song will release riddles solved.
PSA.49.5	There’s no reason to fear when troubling times come,
PSA.49.5	even when you’re surrounded with problems
PSA.49.5	and persecutors who chase at your heels.
PSA.49.6+PSA.49.7	They trust in their treasures and boast in their riches,
PSA.49.6+PSA.49.7	yet not one of them, though rich as a king,
PSA.49.6+PSA.49.7	could rescue his own brother from the guilt of his sins.
PSA.49.6+PSA.49.7	Not one could give God the ransom price
PSA.49.6+PSA.49.7	for the soul of another, let alone for himself.
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	A soul’s redemption is too costly and precious
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	for anyone to pay with earthly wealth.
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	The price to pay is never enough
PSA.49.8+PSA.49.9	to purchase eternal life for even one, to keep them out of hell.
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	The brightest and best, along with the foolish and senseless,
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	God sees that they all will die one day,
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	leaving their houses and wealth to others.
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	Even though they name streets and lands after themselves,
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	hoping to have their memory endure beyond the grave,
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	legends in their own minds,
PSA.49.10+PSA.49.11	their home address is now the cemetery!
PSA.49.12	The honor of man is short-lived and fleeting.
PSA.49.12	There’s little difference between man and beast,
PSA.49.12	for both will one day perish.
PSA.49.13	Such is the path of foolish men
PSA.49.13	and those who quote everything they say,
PSA.49.13	for they are here today and gone tomorrow!
PSA.49.13	Pause in his presence
PSA.49.14	A shepherd called “Death” herds them,
PSA.49.14	leading them like mindless sheep straight to hell.
PSA.49.14	Yet at daybreak you will find the righteous ruling in their place.
PSA.49.14	Every trace of them will be gone forever,
PSA.49.14	with all their “glory” lost in the darkness of their doom.
PSA.49.15	But I know the loving God will redeem my soul,
PSA.49.15	raising me up from the dark power of death,
PSA.49.15	taking me as his bridal partner.
PSA.49.15	Pause in his presence
PSA.49.16	So don’t be disturbed when you see the rich
PSA.49.16	surround you with the “glory” of their wealth on full display.
PSA.49.17	For when they die they will carry nothing with them,
PSA.49.17	and their riches will not follow them beyond the grave.
PSA.49.18+PSA.49.19	Though they have the greatest rewards of this world
PSA.49.18+PSA.49.19	and all applaud them for their accomplishments,
PSA.49.18+PSA.49.19	they will follow those who have gone before them
PSA.49.18+PSA.49.19	and go straight into the realm of darkness,
PSA.49.18+PSA.49.19	where they never ever see the light again.
PSA.49.20	So this is the way of mortal man—
PSA.49.20	honored for a moment, yet without eternal insight,
PSA.49.20	like a beast that will one day perish.
PSA.50.1	The God of gods, the mighty Lord himself, has spoken!
PSA.50.1	He shouts out over all the people of the earth
PSA.50.1	in every brilliant sunrise and every beautiful sunset,
PSA.50.2	God’s glory-light shines out of the Zion-realm
PSA.50.2	with the radiance of perfect beauty.
PSA.50.3	With the rumble of thunder he approaches;
PSA.50.3	he will not be silent, for he comes with an earsplitting sound!
PSA.50.3	All around him are furious flames of fire,
PSA.50.3	and preceding him is the dazzling blaze of his glory.
PSA.50.4	Here he comes to judge his people!
PSA.50.4	He summons his court with heaven and earth as his jury, saying,
PSA.50.5	“Gather all my lovers,
PSA.50.5	my godly ones whose hearts are one with me—
PSA.50.5	those who have entered into my holy covenant
PSA.50.5	by sacrifices upon the altar.”
PSA.50.6	And the heavens declare his justice:
PSA.50.6	“God himself will be their judge,
PSA.50.6	and he will judge them with righteousness!”
PSA.50.6	Pause in his presence
PSA.50.7	“Listen to me, O my people! Listen well, for I am your God!
PSA.50.7	I am bringing you to trial and here are my charges.
PSA.50.8	I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices,
PSA.50.8	which you continually bring to my altar.
PSA.50.9	Do I need your young bull or goats from your fields
PSA.50.9	?
PSA.50.10+PSA.50.11	Every animal of field and forest belongs to me, the Creator.
PSA.50.10+PSA.50.11	I know every movement of the birds in the sky,
PSA.50.10+PSA.50.11	and every animal of the field is in my thoughts.
PSA.50.10+PSA.50.11	The entire world and everything it contains is mine.
PSA.50.12+PSA.50.13	If I were hungry, do you think I would tell you?
PSA.50.12+PSA.50.13	For all that I have created, the fullness of the earth, is mine.
PSA.50.12+PSA.50.13	Am I fed by your sacrifices? Of course not!
PSA.50.14	Why don’t you bring me the sacrifices I desire?
PSA.50.14	Bring me your true and sincere thanks,
PSA.50.14	and show your gratitude by keeping your promises to me,
PSA.50.14	the Most High.
PSA.50.15	Honor me by trusting in me in your day of trouble.
PSA.50.15	Cry aloud to me, and I will be there to rescue you.
PSA.50.16	And now I speak to the wicked. Listen to what I have to say to you!
PSA.50.16	What right do you have to presume to speak for me
PSA.50.16	and claim my covenant promises as yours?
PSA.50.17	For you have hated my instruction and disregarded my words,
PSA.50.17	throwing them away as worthless!
PSA.50.18	You forget to condemn the thief or adulterer.
PSA.50.18	You are their friend, running alongside them into darkness.
PSA.50.19+PSA.50.20	The sins of your mouth multiply evil.
PSA.50.19+PSA.50.20	You have a lifestyle of lies,
PSA.50.19+PSA.50.20	devoted to deceit as you speak against others,
PSA.50.19+PSA.50.20	even slandering those of your own household!
PSA.50.21	All this you have done and I kept silent,
PSA.50.21	so you thought that I was just like you, sanctioning evil.
PSA.50.21	But now I will bring you to my courtroom
PSA.50.21	and spell out clearly my charges before you.
PSA.50.22	This is your last chance, my final warning. Your time is up!
PSA.50.22	Turn away from all this evil, or 
PSA.50.22	 I am coming to pass sentence upon you.
PSA.50.22	I will snatch you away and no one will be there
PSA.50.22	to help you escape my judgment.
PSA.50.23	The life that pleases me is a life lived in the gratitude of grace,
PSA.50.23	always choosing to walk with me in what is right.
PSA.50.23	This is the sacrifice I desire from you.
PSA.50.23	If you do this, more of my salvation will unfold for you.”
PSA.51.1+PSA.51.2	God, give me mercy from your fountain of forgiveness!
PSA.51.1+PSA.51.2	I know your abundant love is enough to wash away my guilt.
PSA.51.1+PSA.51.2	Because your compassion is so great,
PSA.51.1+PSA.51.2	take away this shameful guilt of sin.
PSA.51.1+PSA.51.2	Forgive the full extent of my rebellious ways,
PSA.51.1+PSA.51.2	and erase this deep stain on my conscience.
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	For I’m so ashamed.
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	I feel such pain and anguish within me.
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	I can’t get away from the sting of my sin against you, Lord!
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	Everything I did, I did right in front of you, for you saw it all.
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	Against you, and you above all, have I sinned.
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	Everything you say to me is infallibly true
PSA.51.3+PSA.51.4	and your judgment conquers me.
PSA.51.5	Lord, I have been a sinner from birth,
PSA.51.5	from the moment my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	I know that you delight to set your truth deep in my spirit.
PSA.51.6	So come into the hidden places of my heart
PSA.51.6	and teach me wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Purify my conscience! Make this leper clean again!
PSA.51.7	Wash me in your love until I am pure in heart.
PSA.51.8	Satisfy me in your sweetness, and my song of joy will return.
PSA.51.8	The places within me you have crushed
PSA.51.8	will rejoice in your healing touch.
PSA.51.9	Hide my sins from your face;
PSA.51.9	erase all my guilt by your saving grace.
PSA.51.10	Create a new, clean heart within me.
PSA.51.10	Fill me with pure thoughts and holy desires, ready to please you.
PSA.51.11	May you never reject me!
PSA.51.11	May you never take from me your sacred Spirit!
PSA.51.12	Let my passion for life be restored,
PSA.51.12	tasting joy in every breakthrough you bring to me.
PSA.51.12	Hold me close to you with a willing spirit
PSA.51.12	that obeys whatever you say.
PSA.51.13	Then I can show to other guilty ones
PSA.51.13	how loving and merciful you are.
PSA.51.13	They will find their way back home to you,
PSA.51.13	knowing that you will forgive them.
PSA.51.14	O God, my saving God,
PSA.51.14	deliver me fully from every sin,
PSA.51.14	even the sin that brought bloodguilt.
PSA.51.14	Then my heart will once again be thrilled to sing
PSA.51.14	the passionate songs of joy and deliverance!
PSA.51.15	Lord God, unlock my heart, unlock my lips,
PSA.51.15	and I will overcome with my joyous praise!
PSA.51.16	For the source of your pleasure is not in my performance
PSA.51.16	or the sacrifices I might offer to you.
PSA.51.17	The fountain of your pleasure is found
PSA.51.17	in the sacrifice of my shattered heart before you.
PSA.51.17	You will not despise my tenderness
PSA.51.17	as I humbly bow down at your feet.
PSA.51.18	Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her.
PSA.51.18	Be the protecting wall around Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	And when we are fully restored,
PSA.51.19	you will rejoice and take delight
PSA.51.19	in every offering of our lives
PSA.51.19	as we bring our sacrifices of righteousness before you in love!
PSA.52.1	You call yourself a mighty man, a big shot?
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast in the evil you have done?
PSA.52.1	Yet God’s loyal love will protect me and carry the day!
PSA.52.2	Listen, O deceiver, trickster of others:
PSA.52.2	Your words are wicked, harming and hurting all who hear them.
PSA.52.3	You love evil and hate what is good and right.
PSA.52.3	You would rather lie than tell the truth.
PSA.52.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.52.4	You love to distort, devour, and deceive,
PSA.52.4	using your sly tongue to spin the truth.
PSA.52.5	But the Almighty will strike you down forever!
PSA.52.5	He will pull you up by your roots
PSA.52.5	and drag you away to the darkness of death.
PSA.52.5	Pause in his presence
PSA.52.6	The godly will see all this and will be awestruck.
PSA.52.6	Then they will laugh at the wicked, saying,
PSA.52.7	“See what happens to those great in their own eyes
PSA.52.7	who don’t trust in the Most High to save them!
PSA.52.7	Look how they trusted only in their wealth
PSA.52.7	and made their living from wickedness.”
PSA.52.8	But I am like a flourishing olive tree, 
PSA.52.8	I trust in the unending love of God;
PSA.52.8	his passion toward me is forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	Because it is finished
PSA.52.9	I will be praising you forever and giving you thanks.
PSA.52.9	Before all your godly lovers I will proclaim your beautiful name!
PSA.53.1	Only the withering soul would say to himself,
PSA.53.1	“There’s no God for me!”
PSA.53.1	Anyone who thinks like that is corrupt and callous;
PSA.53.1	depraved and detestable, they are devoid of what is good.
PSA.53.2	The Lord looks down in love, bending over heaven’s balcony.
PSA.53.2	God looks over all of Adam’s sons and daughters,
PSA.53.2	looking to see if there are any who are wise with insight—
PSA.53.2	any who search for him, wanting to please him.
PSA.53.3	But no, all have wandered astray, walking stubbornly toward evil.
PSA.53.3	Not one is good; he can’t even find one!
PSA.53.4	Look how they live in luxury while exploiting my people.
PSA.53.4	Won’t these workers of wickedness ever learn!
PSA.53.4	They never even think of praying to God.
PSA.53.5	Soon, unheard-of terror will seize them while in their sins.
PSA.53.5	God himself will one day scatter the bones
PSA.53.5	of those who rose up against you.
PSA.53.5	Doomed and rejected, they will be put to shame,
PSA.53.5	for God has despised them.
PSA.53.6	Oh, I wish our time of rescue were already here.
PSA.53.6	Oh, that God would come forth now—
PSA.53.6	arising from the midst of his Zion-people
PSA.53.6	to save and restore his very own.
PSA.53.6	When God fully restores his people,
PSA.53.6	Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be filled with gladness!
PSA.54.1	God, deliver me by your mighty name!
PSA.54.1	Come with your glorious power and save me!
PSA.54.2	Listen to my prayer; turn your ears to my cry!
PSA.54.3	These violent men have risen up against me;
PSA.54.3	heartless, ruthless men who care nothing about God
PSA.54.3	seek to take my life.
PSA.54.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.54.4	But the Lord God has become my divine helper.
PSA.54.4	He leans into my heart and lays his hands upon me!
PSA.54.5	God will see to it that those who sow evil will reap evil.
PSA.54.5	So Lord, in your great faithfulness, destroy them once and for all!
PSA.54.6	Lord, I will offer myself freely, and everything I am I give to you.
PSA.54.6	I will worship and praise your name, O Lord,
PSA.54.6	for it is precious to me.
PSA.54.7	Through you I’m saved—rescued from every trouble.
PSA.54.7	I’ve seen with my eyes the defeat of my enemies.
PSA.54.7	I’ve triumphed over them all!
PSA.55.1	God, listen to my prayer!
PSA.55.1	Don’t hide your heart from me when I cry out to you!
PSA.55.2+PSA.55.3	Come close to me and give me your answer.
PSA.55.2+PSA.55.3	Here I am, moaning and restless.
PSA.55.2+PSA.55.3	I’m preoccupied with the threats of my enemies
PSA.55.2+PSA.55.3	and crushed by the pressure of their opposition.
PSA.55.2+PSA.55.3	They surround me with trouble and terror.
PSA.55.2+PSA.55.3	In their fury they rise up against me in an angry uproar.
PSA.55.4	My heart is trembling inside my chest
PSA.55.4	as the terror of death seizes me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and dread overwhelm me. I shudder before the horror I face.
PSA.55.6	I say to myself, “If only I could fly away from all of this!
PSA.55.6	If only I could run away to the place of rest and peace.
PSA.55.7	I would run far away where no one could find me,
PSA.55.7	escaping to a wilderness retreat.”
PSA.55.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.55.8	I will hurry off to hide in the higher place,
PSA.55.8	into my shelter, safe from this raging storm and tempest.
PSA.55.9	God, confuse them until they quarrel with themselves.
PSA.55.9	Destroy them with their own violent strife and slander.
PSA.55.9	They have divided the city with their discord.
PSA.55.10	Though they patrol the walls night and day against invaders,
PSA.55.10	the real danger is within the city.
PSA.55.10	It’s the misery and strife in the hearts of its people.
PSA.55.11	Murder is in their midst.
PSA.55.11	Wherever you turn you find trouble and ruin.
PSA.55.12	It wasn’t an enemy who taunted me.
PSA.55.12	If it was my enemy, filled with pride and hatred,
PSA.55.12	then I could have endured it. I would have just run away.
PSA.55.13	But it was you, my intimate friend—one like a brother to me.
PSA.55.13	It was you, my advisor, the companion
PSA.55.13	I walked with and worked with!
PSA.55.14	We once had sweet fellowship with each other.
PSA.55.14	We worshiped in unity as one,
PSA.55.14	celebrating together with God’s people.
PSA.55.15	Now desolation and darkness has come upon you.
PSA.55.15	May you and all those like you descend into the pit of destruction!
PSA.55.15	Since evil has been your home, may evil now bury you alive!
PSA.55.16	But as for me, I will call upon the Lord to save me, and I know he will!
PSA.55.17	Every evening I will explain my need to him.
PSA.55.17	Every morning I will move my soul toward him.
PSA.55.17	Every waking hour I will worship only him,
PSA.55.17	and he will hear and respond to my cry.
PSA.55.18	Though many wish to fight and the tide of battle turns against me,
PSA.55.18	by your power I will be safe and secure;
PSA.55.18	peace will be my portion.
PSA.55.19	God himself will hear me!
PSA.55.19	God-Enthroned through everlasting ages,
PSA.55.19	the God of unchanging faithfulness—
PSA.55.19	he will put them in their place,
PSA.55.19	all those who refuse to love and revere him!
PSA.55.19	Pause in his presence
PSA.55.20	I was betrayed by my friend, though I lived in peace with him.
PSA.55.20	While he was stretching out his hand of friendship,
PSA.55.20	he was secretly breaking every promise he had ever made to me!
PSA.55.21	His words were smooth and charming.
PSA.55.21	Yet his heart was disloyal and full of hatred—
PSA.55.21	his words soft as silk while all the time scheming my demise.
PSA.55.22	So here’s what I’ve learned through it all:
PSA.55.22	Leave all your cares and anxieties at the feet of the Lord,
PSA.55.22	and measureless grace will strengthen you.
PSA.55.23	He will watch over his lovers,
PSA.55.23	never letting them slip or be overthrown.
PSA.55.23	He will send all my enemies to the pit of destruction.
PSA.55.23	Murderers, liars, and betrayers will face an untimely death.
PSA.55.23	My life’s hope and trust is in you, and you’ll never fail to rescue me!
PSA.56.1	Lord, show me your kindness and mercy,
PSA.56.1	for these men oppose and oppress me all day long.
PSA.56.2	Not a day goes by but that somebody harasses me.
PSA.56.2	So many in their pride trample me under their feet.
PSA.56.3	But in the day that I’m afraid, I lay all my fears before you
PSA.56.3	and trust in you with all my heart.
PSA.56.4	What harm could a man bring to me?
PSA.56.4	With God on my side I will not be afraid of what comes.
PSA.56.4	The roaring praises of God fill my heart,
PSA.56.4	and I will always triumph as I trust his promises.
PSA.56.5	Day after day cruel critics distort my words;
PSA.56.5	constantly they plot my collapse.
PSA.56.6	Lurking in the dark, waiting, spying on my movements in secret
PSA.56.6	to take me by surprise, ready to take my life.
PSA.56.7	They don’t deserve to get away with this!
PSA.56.7	Look at their wickedness, their injustice, Lord.
PSA.56.7	In your fierce anger cast them down to defeat.
PSA.56.8	You’ve kept track of all my wandering and my weeping.
PSA.56.8	You’ve stored my many tears in your bottle—not one will be lost.
PSA.56.8	For they are all recorded in your book of remembrance.
PSA.56.9	The very moment I call to you for a father’s help
PSA.56.9	the tide of battle turns and my enemies flee.
PSA.56.9	This one thing I know: God is on my side!
PSA.56.10	I trust in the Lord. And I praise him!
PSA.56.10	I trust in the Word of God. And I praise him!
PSA.56.11	What harm could man do to me?
PSA.56.11	With God on my side I will not be afraid of what comes.
PSA.56.11	My heart overflows with praise to God and for his promises.
PSA.56.11	I will always trust in him.
PSA.56.12	So I’m thanking you with all my heart,
PSA.56.12	with gratitude for all you’ve done.
PSA.56.12	I will do everything I’ve promised you, Lord.
PSA.56.13	For you have saved my soul from death
PSA.56.13	and my feet from stumbling
PSA.56.13	so that I can walk before the Lord
PSA.56.13	bathed in his life-giving light.
PSA.57.1	Please, God, show me mercy!
PSA.57.1	Open your grace-fountain for me,
PSA.57.1	for you are my soul’s true shelter.
PSA.57.1	I will hide beneath the shadow of your embrace,
PSA.57.1	under the wings of your cherubim,
PSA.57.1	until this terrible trouble is past.
PSA.57.2	I will cry out to you, the God of the highest heaven,
PSA.57.2	the mighty God, who performs all these wonders for me.
PSA.57.3	From heaven he will 
PSA.57.3	He will trample down those who trample me.
PSA.57.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.57.3	He will always show me love
PSA.57.3	by his gracious and constant care.
PSA.57.4	I am surrounded by these fierce and brutal men.
PSA.57.4	They are like lions just wanting to tear me to shreds.
PSA.57.4	Why must I continue to live among these seething terrorists,
PSA.57.4	breathing out their angry threats and insults against me?
PSA.57.5	Lord God, be exalted as you soar throughout the heavens.
PSA.57.5	May your shining glory be seen in the skies!
PSA.57.5	Let it be seen high above over all the earth!
PSA.57.6	For they have set a trap for me.
PSA.57.6	Frantic fear has me overwhelmed.
PSA.57.6	But look! The very trap they set for me
PSA.57.6	has sprung shut upon themselves instead of me!
PSA.57.6	Pause in his presence
PSA.57.7	My heart, O God, is quiet and confident.
PSA.57.7	Now I can sing with passion your wonderful praises!
PSA.57.8	Awake, O my soul, with the music of his splendor-song!
PSA.57.8	Arise, my soul, and sing his praises!
PSA.57.8	My worship will awaken the dawn,
PSA.57.8	greeting the daybreak with my songs 
PSA.57.9	Wherever I go I will thank you, my God.
PSA.57.9	Among all the nations they will hear my praise songs to you.
PSA.57.10	Your love is so extravagant it reaches to the heavens,
PSA.57.10	Your faithfulness so astonishing it stretches to the sky!
PSA.57.11	Lord God, be exalted as you soar throughout the heavens.
PSA.57.11	May your shining glory be shown in the skies!
PSA.57.11	Let it be seen high above all the earth!
PSA.58.1+PSA.58.2	God’s justice? You high and mighty politicians
PSA.58.1+PSA.58.2	know nothing about it!
PSA.58.1+PSA.58.2	Which one of you has walked in justice toward others?
PSA.58.1+PSA.58.2	Which one of you has treated everyone right and fair?
PSA.58.1+PSA.58.2	Not one! You only give “justice” in exchange for a bribe.
PSA.58.1+PSA.58.2	For the right price you let others get away with murder.
PSA.58.3+PSA.58.4	Wicked wanderers even from the womb, that’s who you are!
PSA.58.3+PSA.58.4	Lying with your words, your teaching is poison.
PSA.58.5	Like cobras closing their ears to the most expert of the charmers,
PSA.58.5	.
PSA.58.6	O God, break their fangs;
PSA.58.6	shatter the teeth of these ravenous lions!
PSA.58.7	Let them disappear like water falling on thirsty ground.
PSA.58.7	Let all their weapons be useless.
PSA.58.8	Let them be like snails dissolving into the slime.
PSA.58.8	Let them be cut off, never seeing the light of day!
PSA.58.9	God will sweep them away so fast
PSA.58.9	that they’ll never know what hit them.
PSA.58.10	The godly will celebrate in the triumph of good over evil.
PSA.58.10	And the lovers of God will trample
PSA.58.10	the wickedness of the wicked under their feet!
PSA.58.11	Then everyone will say, “There is a God who judges the judges”
PSA.58.11	and “There is a great reward in loving God!”
PSA.59.1	My God, protect me!
PSA.59.1	Keep me safe from all my enemies, for they’re coming to kill me.
PSA.59.1	Put me in a high place out of their reach—
PSA.59.1	a place so high that these assassins will never find me.
PSA.59.2	Save me from these murdering men, these bloodthirsty killers.
PSA.59.3	See how they set an ambush for my life.
PSA.59.3	They’re fierce men ready to launch their attack against me.
PSA.59.3	O Lord, I’m innocent; 
PSA.59.4	I’ve done nothing to deserve this,
PSA.59.4	yet they are already plotting together to kill me.
PSA.59.4	Arise, Lord, see what they’re scheming, and come and meet with me.
PSA.59.5	Awaken, O God of Israel!
PSA.59.5	Commander of Angel Armies,
PSA.59.5	arise to punish these treacherous people who oppose you!
PSA.59.5	Don’t go soft on these hardcase killers!
PSA.59.5	Pause in his presence
PSA.59.6	After dark they came to spy, sneaking around the city,
PSA.59.6	snarling, prowling like a pack of stray dogs in the night—
PSA.59.7	boiling over with rage, shouting out their curses,
PSA.59.7	convinced that they’ll never get caught.
PSA.59.8	But you, Lord, break out laughing at their plans,
PSA.59.8	amused by their arrogance, scoffing at their sinful ways.
PSA.59.9	My strength is found when I wait upon you.
PSA.59.9	Watch over me, God, for you are my mountain fortress;
PSA.59.9	you set me on high!
PSA.59.10	The God of passionate love will meet with me.
PSA.59.10	My God will empower me to rise in triumph over my foes.
PSA.59.11	Don’t kill them; stagger them all with a vivid display of power.
PSA.59.11	And scatter them with your armies of angels,
PSA.59.11	O mighty God, our protector!
PSA.59.11	Use your awesome power to make them wanderers and vagabonds
PSA.59.11	and then bring them down.
PSA.59.12	They are nothing but proud, cursing liars.
PSA.59.12	They sin in every word they speak, boasting in their blasphemies!
PSA.59.13	May your wrath be kindled to destroy them; finish them off!
PSA.59.13	Make an end of them and their deeds until they are no more!
PSA.59.13	Let them all know and learn
PSA.59.13	that God is the ruler over Jacob,
PSA.59.13	the God-King over all the earth!
PSA.59.13	Pause in his presence
PSA.59.14	Here they come again—
PSA.59.14	prowling, growling like a pack of stray dogs in the city.
PSA.59.15	Drifting, devouring, and coming in for the kill,
PSA.59.15	they refuse to sleep until they’ve eaten their fill.
PSA.59.16	But as for me, your strength shall be my song of joy.
PSA.59.16	At each and every sunrise, my lyrics of your love will fill the air!
PSA.59.16	For you have been my glory-fortress,
PSA.59.16	a stronghold in my day of distress.
PSA.59.17	O my strength, I sing with joy your praises.
PSA.59.17	O my stronghold, I sing with joy your song!
PSA.59.17	O my Savior, I sing with joy the lyrics of your faithful love for me!
PSA.60.1	God, it seems like you walked off and left us!
PSA.60.1	Why have you turned against us?
PSA.60.1	You have been angry with us.
PSA.60.1	O Lord, we plead, come back and help us 
PSA.60.2	The earth quivers and quakes before you,
PSA.60.2	splitting open and breaking apart.
PSA.60.2	Now come and heal it, for it is shaken to its depths.
PSA.60.3	You have taught us hard lessons
PSA.60.3	and made us drink the wine of bewilderment.
PSA.60.4	You have given miraculous signs to those who love you.
PSA.60.4	As we follow you we fly the flag of truth,
PSA.60.4	and all who love the truth will rally to it.
PSA.60.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.60.5	Come to your beloved ones and gently draw us out.
PSA.60.5	For Lord, you save those whom you love.
PSA.60.5	Come with your might and strength!
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	Then I heard the Lord speak in his holy splendor.
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	From his sanctuary I heard the Lord promise:
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	“In my triumph I will be the one to measure out
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	the portion of my inheritance to my people,
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	and I will secure the land as I promised you.
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	Shechem, Succoth, Gilead, Manasseh,
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	they are all still mine!” he says.
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	“Judah will continue to produce kings and lawgivers,
PSA.60.6+PSA.60.7	and Ephraim will produce great warriors.
PSA.60.8	Moab will become my lowly servant.
PSA.60.8	Edom will likewise serve my purposes.
PSA.60.8	I will lift up a shout of victory over the land of Philistia!
PSA.60.9	But who will bring my triumph into the strong city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me into Edom’s fortresses?”
PSA.60.10	Have you really rejected us, refusing to fight our battles?
PSA.60.11	Give us a father’s help when we face our enemies.
PSA.60.11	For to trust in any man is an empty hope.
PSA.60.12	With God’s help we will fight like heroes
PSA.60.12	and he will trample down our every foe!
PSA.61.1	O God, hear my prayer. Listen to my heart’s cry.
PSA.61.2	For no matter where I am, even when I’m far from home,
PSA.61.2	I will cry out to you for a father’s help.
PSA.61.2	When I’m feeble and overwhelmed by life,
PSA.61.2	guide me into your glory, where I am safe and sheltered.
PSA.61.3	Lord, you are a paradise of protection to me.
PSA.61.3	You lift me high above the fray.
PSA.61.3	None of my foes can touch me
PSA.61.3	when I’m held firmly in your wrap-around presence!
PSA.61.4	Keep me in this glory.
PSA.61.4	Let me live continually under your splendor-shadow,
PSA.61.4	hiding my life in you forever.
PSA.61.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.61.5	You have heard my sweet resolutions
PSA.61.5	to love and serve you, for I am your beloved.
PSA.61.5	And you have given me an inheritance of rich treasures,
PSA.61.5	which you give to all your lovers.
PSA.61.6	You treat me like a king, giving me a full and abundant life,
PSA.61.6	years and years of reigning,
PSA.61.6	like many generations rolled into one.
PSA.61.7	I will live enthroned with you forever!
PSA.61.7	Guard me, God, with your unending, unfailing love.
PSA.61.7	Let me live my days walking in grace and truth before you.
PSA.61.8	And my praises will fill the heavens forever,
PSA.61.8	fulfilling my vow to make every day a love gift to you!
PSA.62.1	I stand silently to listen for the one I love,
PSA.62.1	waiting as long as it takes for the Lord to rescue me.
PSA.62.1	For God alone has become my Savior.
PSA.62.2	He alone is my safe place;
PSA.62.2	his wrap-around presence always protects me.
PSA.62.2	For he is my champion defender;
PSA.62.2	there’s no risk of failure with God.
PSA.62.2	So why would I let worry paralyze me,
PSA.62.2	even when troubles multiply around me?
PSA.62.3	But look at these who want me dead,
PSA.62.3	shouting their vicious threats at me!
PSA.62.3	The moment they discover my weakness
PSA.62.3	they all begin plotting to take me down.
PSA.62.4	Liars, hypocrites, with nothing good to say.
PSA.62.4	All of their energies are spent
PSA.62.4	on moving me from this exalted place.
PSA.62.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.62.5	I am standing in absolute stillness, silent before the one I love,
PSA.62.5	waiting as long as it takes for him to rescue me.
PSA.62.5	Only God is my Savior, and he will not fail me.
PSA.62.6	For he alone is my safe place.
PSA.62.6	His wrap-around presence always protects me
PSA.62.6	as my champion defender.
PSA.62.6	There’s no risk of failure with God!
PSA.62.6	So why would I let worry paralyze me,
PSA.62.6	even when troubles multiply around me?
PSA.62.7	God’s glory is all around me!
PSA.62.7	His wrap-around presence is all I need,
PSA.62.7	for the Lord is my Savior, my hero, and my life-giving strength.
PSA.62.8	Join me, everyone! Trust only in God every moment!
PSA.62.8	Tell him all your troubles and pour out your heart-longings to him.
PSA.62.8	Believe me when I tell you—he will help you!
PSA.62.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.62.9	Before God all the people of the earth, high or low,
PSA.62.9	are like smoke that disappears,
PSA.62.9	like a vapor that quickly vanishes away.
PSA.62.9	Compared to God they’re nothing but vanity, nothing at all!
PSA.62.10	The wealth of the world is nothing to God.
PSA.62.10	So if your wealth increases, don’t be boastful or
PSA.62.10	put your trust in your money.
PSA.62.10	And don’t you think for a moment that
PSA.62.10	you can get away with stealing by overcharging others
PSA.62.10	just to get more for yourself!
PSA.62.11	God said to me once and for all,
PSA.62.11	“All the strength and power you need flows from me!”
PSA.62.11	And again I heard it clearly said,
PSA.62.12	“All the love you need is found in me!”
PSA.62.12	 you repay people for what they do.
PSA.63.1	O God of my life, I’m lovesick for you in this weary wilderness.
PSA.63.1	I thirst with the deepest longings to love you more,
PSA.63.1	with cravings in my heart that can’t be described.
PSA.63.1	Such yearning grips my soul for you, my God!
PSA.63.2	I’m energized every time I enter
PSA.63.2	your heavenly sanctuary to seek more of your power
PSA.63.2	and drink in more of your glory.
PSA.63.3	For your tender mercies mean more to me than life itself.
PSA.63.3	How I love and praise you, God!
PSA.63.4	Daily I will worship you passionately and with all my heart.
PSA.63.4	My arms will wave to you like banners of praise.
PSA.63.5	I overflow with praise when I come before you,
PSA.63.5	for the anointing of your presence satisfies me like nothing else.
PSA.63.5	You are such a rich banquet of pleasure to my soul.
PSA.63.6+PSA.63.7	I lie awake each night thinking of you
PSA.63.6+PSA.63.7	and reflecting on how you help me like a father.
PSA.63.6+PSA.63.7	I sing through the night under your splendor-shadow,
PSA.63.6+PSA.63.7	offering up to you my songs of delight and joy!
PSA.63.8	With passion I pursue and cling to you.
PSA.63.8	Because I feel your grip on my life,
PSA.63.8	I keep my soul close to your heart.
PSA.63.9	Those who plot to destroy me shall descend into the darkness of hell.
PSA.63.10	They will be consumed by their own evil
PSA.63.10	and become nothing more than dust under our feet.
PSA.63.11	These liars will be silenced forever!
PSA.63.11	But with the anointing of a king I will dance and rejoice
PSA.63.11	along with all his lovers who trust in him.
PSA.64.1+PSA.64.2	Lord, can’t you hear my cry, my bitter complaint?
PSA.64.1+PSA.64.2	Keep me safe from this band of criminals and
PSA.64.1+PSA.64.2	from the conspiracy of these wicked men.
PSA.64.1+PSA.64.2	They gather in their secret counsel to destroy me.
PSA.64.3+PSA.64.4	Can’t you hear their slander, their lies?
PSA.64.3+PSA.64.4	Their words are like poison-tipped arrows
PSA.64.3+PSA.64.4	shot from the shadows.
PSA.64.3+PSA.64.4	They are unafraid and have no fear of consequences.
PSA.64.5	They set their traps against us in secret;
PSA.64.5	they strengthen one another, saying,
PSA.64.5	“No one can see us. Who can stop us?”
PSA.64.5	They’re nothing more than unruly mobs
PSA.64.5	joined in their unholy alliance,
PSA.64.6	searching out new opportunities to pervert justice—
PSA.64.6	deceivers scheming together their ill-conceived plot
PSA.64.6	as they plan the “perfect crime.”
PSA.64.6	How unsearchable is their endless evil,
PSA.64.6	trying desperately to hide the deep darkness of their hearts.
PSA.64.7	But all the while God has his own fire-tipped arrows!
PSA.64.7	Suddenly, without warning,
PSA.64.7	they will be pierced and struck down.
PSA.64.8	Staggering backward they will be destroyed
PSA.64.8	by the very ones they spoke against.
PSA.64.8	All who see this will view them with scorn.
PSA.64.9	Then all will stand awestruck over what God has done,
PSA.64.9	seeing how he vindicated the victims of these crimes.
PSA.64.10	The lovers of God will be glad, rejoicing in the Lord.
PSA.64.10	They will be found in his glorious wrap-around presence,
PSA.64.10	singing songs of praise to God!
PSA.65.1+PSA.65.2	O God in Zion, to you even silence is praise!
PSA.65.1+PSA.65.2	You are the God who answers prayer;
PSA.65.1+PSA.65.2	all of humanity comes before you with their requests.
PSA.65.3	Though we are overcome by our many sins,
PSA.65.3	your sacrifice covers over them all.
PSA.65.4	And your priestly lovers, those you’ve chosen,
PSA.65.4	will be greatly favored to be brought close to you.
PSA.65.4	What inexpressible joys are theirs!
PSA.65.4	What feasts of mercy fill them in your heavenly sanctuary!
PSA.65.4	How satisfied we will be just to be near you!
PSA.65.5	You answer our prayers with amazing wonders
PSA.65.5	and with awe-inspiring displays of power.
PSA.65.5	You are the righteous God who helps us like a father.
PSA.65.5	Everyone everywhere looks to you,
PSA.65.5	for you are the confidence of all the earth,
PSA.65.5	even to the farthest islands of the sea.
PSA.65.6	What jaw-dropping, astounding power is yours!
PSA.65.6	You are the mountain maker who sets them all in place.
PSA.65.7	You muzzle the roar of the mighty seas
PSA.65.7	and the rage of mobs with their noisy riots.
PSA.65.8	O God, to the farthest corners of the planet
PSA.65.8	people will stand in awe,
PSA.65.8	startled and stunned by your signs and wonders.
PSA.65.8	Sunrise brilliance and sunset beauty
PSA.65.8	both take turns singing their songs of joy to you.
PSA.65.9	Your visitations of glory bless the earth;
PSA.65.9	the rivers of God overflow and enrich it.
PSA.65.9	You paint the wheat fields golden as you provide rich harvests.
PSA.65.10	Every field is watered with the abundance of rain—
PSA.65.10	showers soaking the earth and softening its clods,
PSA.65.10	causing seeds to sprout throughout the land.
PSA.65.11	You crown the earth with its yearly harvest,
PSA.65.11	the fruits of your goodness.
PSA.65.11	Wherever you go the tracks of your chariot wheels drip with oil.
PSA.65.12	Luxuriant green pastures boast of your bounty
PSA.65.12	as you make every hillside blossom with joy.
PSA.65.13	The grazing meadows are covered with flocks,
PSA.65.13	and the fertile valleys are clothed with grain,
PSA.65.13	each one dancing and shouting for joy, creation’s celebration!
PSA.65.13	And they’re all singing their songs of praise to you!
PSA.66.1	Everyone everywhere, lift up your joyful shout to God!
PSA.66.2	Sing your songs tuned to his glory!
PSA.66.2	Tell the world how wonderful he is.
PSA.66.3	For he’s the awe-inspiring God, great and glorious in power!
PSA.66.3	Mighty in miracles, you cause your enemies to tremble.
PSA.66.3	No wonder they all surrender and bow before you!
PSA.66.4	All the earth will bow down to worship;
PSA.66.4	all the earth will sing your glories forever!
PSA.66.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.66.5	Everyone will say, “Come and see the incredible things God has done;
PSA.66.5	it will take your breath away!
PSA.66.5	He multiplies miracles for his people!”
PSA.66.6	He made a highway going right through the Red Sea
PSA.66.6	as the Hebrews passed through on dry ground,
PSA.66.6	exploding with joyous excitement over the miracles of God.
PSA.66.7	In his great and mighty power he rules forever,
PSA.66.7	watching over every movement of every nation.
PSA.66.7	So beware, rebel lands; he knows how to humble you!
PSA.66.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.66.8	Praise God, all you peoples.
PSA.66.8	Praise him everywhere and let everyone know you love him!
PSA.66.9	There’s no doubt about it; God holds our lives safely in his hands.
PSA.66.9	He’s the one who keeps us faithfully following him.
PSA.66.10	O Lord, we have passed through your fire;
PSA.66.10	like precious metal made pure,
PSA.66.10	you’ve proved us, perfected us, and made us holy.
PSA.66.11	You’ve captured us, ensnared us in your net.
PSA.66.11	Then, like prisoners, you 
PSA.66.12	You’ve allowed our enemies to prevail against us.
PSA.66.12	We’ve passed through fire and flood,
PSA.66.12	yet in the end you always bring us out better than we were before,
PSA.66.12	saturated with your goodness.
PSA.66.13	I come before your presence with my sacrifice.
PSA.66.13	I’ll give you all that I’ve promised, everything I have.
PSA.66.14	When I was overcome in my anguish,
PSA.66.14	I promised to give you my sacrifice.
PSA.66.14	Here it is! All that I said I would offer you is yours.
PSA.66.15	The best I have to bring, I’ll throw it all into the fire
PSA.66.15	as the fragrance of my sacrifice ascends unto you.
PSA.66.15	Pause in his presence
PSA.66.16	All you lovers of God who want to please him,
PSA.66.16	come and listen, and I’ll tell you what he did for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried aloud to him with all my heart and he answered me!
PSA.66.17	Now my mouth overflows with the highest praise.
PSA.66.18	Yet if I had closed my eyes to my sin,
PSA.66.18	the Lord God would have closed his ears to my prayer.
PSA.66.19	But praises rise to God,
PSA.66.19	for he paid attention to my prayer and answered my cry to him!
PSA.66.20	I will forever praise this God who didn’t close his heart when I prayed
PSA.66.20	and never said no when I asked him for help.
PSA.66.20	He never once refused to show me his tender love.
PSA.67.1	God, keep us near your mercy-fountain and bless us!
PSA.67.1	And when you look down on us, may your face beam with joy!
PSA.67.1	Pause in his presence
PSA.67.2	Send us out all over the world so that everyone everywhere
PSA.67.2	will discover your ways and know who you are
PSA.67.2	and see your power to save.
PSA.67.3	Let all the nations burst forth with praise;
PSA.67.3	let everyone everywhere love and enjoy you!
PSA.67.4	Then how glad the nations will be when you are their King.
PSA.67.4	They will sing, they will shout, for you give true justice to the people.
PSA.67.4	Yes! You, Lord, are the shepherd of the nations!
PSA.67.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.67.5	No wonder the peoples praise you!
PSA.67.5	Let all the people praise you more!
PSA.67.6	The harvest of the earth is here!
PSA.67.6	God, the very God we worship,
PSA.67.6	keeps us satisfied at his banquet of blessings.
PSA.67.7	And the blessings keep coming!
PSA.67.7	Then all the ends of the earth will give him
PSA.67.7	the honor he deserves and be in awe of him!
PSA.68.1	God! Arise with awesome power,
PSA.68.1	and every one of your enemies will scatter in fear!
PSA.68.2	Chase them away—all these God-haters.
PSA.68.2	Blow them away as a puff of smoke.
PSA.68.2	Melt them away like wax in the fire.
PSA.68.2	One good look at you and the wicked vanish.
PSA.68.3	But let all your godly lovers be glad!
PSA.68.3	Yes, let them all rejoice in your presence
PSA.68.3	and be carried away with gladness.
PSA.68.3	Let them laugh and be radiant with joy!
PSA.68.4	Let them sing their celebration-songs
PSA.68.4	for the coming of the cloud rider whose name is Yah!
PSA.68.5+PSA.68.6	To the fatherless he is a father.
PSA.68.5+PSA.68.6	To the widow he is a champion friend.
PSA.68.5+PSA.68.6	To the lonely he makes them part of a family.
PSA.68.5+PSA.68.6	To the prisoners he leads into prosperity until they sing for joy.
PSA.68.5+PSA.68.6	This is our Holy God in his Holy Place!
PSA.68.5+PSA.68.6	But for the rebels there is heartache and despair.
PSA.68.7	O Lord, it was you who marched in front of your people,
PSA.68.7	leading them through the wasteland.
PSA.68.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.68.8	The earth shook beneath your feet; the heavens filled with clouds
PSA.68.8	before the presence of the God of Sinai.
PSA.68.8	The sacred mountain shook at the sight of the face of Israel’s God.
PSA.68.9	You, O God, sent the reviving rain upon your weary inheritance,
PSA.68.9	showers of blessing to refresh it.
PSA.68.10	So there your people settled.
PSA.68.10	And in your kindness you provided the poor with abundance.
PSA.68.11	God Almighty declares the word of the gospel with power,
PSA.68.11	and the warring women of Zion deliver its message:
PSA.68.12	“The conquering legions have themselves been conquered.
PSA.68.12	Look at them flee!”
PSA.68.12	Now Zion’s women are left to gather the spoils.
PSA.68.13	When you sleep between sharpened stakes,
PSA.68.13	I see you sparkling like silver and glistening like gold,
PSA.68.13	covered by the beautiful wings of a dove!
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty found a king for himself,
PSA.68.14	it became white as snow in his shade.
PSA.68.15+PSA.68.16	O huge, magnificent mountain,
PSA.68.15+PSA.68.16	you are the mighty kingdom of God!
PSA.68.15+PSA.68.16	All the other peaks, though impressive and imposing,
PSA.68.15+PSA.68.16	look with envy on you, Mount Zion!
PSA.68.15+PSA.68.16	For Zion is the mountain where God has chosen to live forever.
PSA.68.17	Look! The mighty chariots of God!
PSA.68.17	Ten thousands upon ten thousands,
PSA.68.17	more than anyone could ever number.
PSA.68.17	God is at the front,
PSA.68.17	leading them all from Mount Sinai into his sanctuary
PSA.68.17	with the radiance of holiness upon him.
PSA.68.18	He ascends into the heavenly heights,
PSA.68.18	taking his many captured ones with him,
PSA.68.18	leading them in triumphal procession.
PSA.68.18	And gifts were given to men, even the once rebellious,
PSA.68.18	so that they may dwell with Yah.
PSA.68.19	What a glorious God!
PSA.68.19	He gives us salvation over and over,
PSA.68.19	then daily he carries our burdens!
PSA.68.19	Pause in his presence
PSA.68.20	Our God is a mighty God who saves us over and over!
PSA.68.20	For the Lord, Yahweh, rescues us
PSA.68.20	from the ways of death many times.
PSA.68.21	But he will crush every enemy, shattering their strength.
PSA.68.21	He will make heads roll
PSA.68.21	for they refuse to repent of their stubborn, sinful ways.
PSA.68.22	I hear the Lord God saying to all the enemies of his people,
PSA.68.22	“You’d better come out of your hiding places,
PSA.68.22	all of you who are doing your best to stay far away from me.
PSA.68.22	Don’t you know there’s no place to hide?
PSA.68.23	For my people will be the conquerors;
PSA.68.23	they will soon have you under their feet.
PSA.68.23	They will crush you until there is nothing left!”
PSA.68.24	O God, my King, your triumphal processions
PSA.68.24	keep moving onward in holiness;
PSA.68.24	you’re moving onward toward the Holy Place!
PSA.68.25	Leaders in front, then musicians,
PSA.68.25	with young maidens in between, striking their tambourines.
PSA.68.26	And they sing, “Let all God’s princely people rejoice!
PSA.68.26	Let all the congregations bring their blessing to God, saying,
PSA.68.26	‘The Lord of the fountain! The Lord of the fountain of life!
PSA.68.26	The Lord of the fountain of Israel!’ ”
PSA.68.27	Astonishingly, it’s the favored youth leading the way:
PSA.68.27	princes of praise in their royal robes,
PSA.68.27	and exalted princes are among them,
PSA.68.27	along with princes who have wrestled with God.
PSA.68.28+PSA.68.29	Display your strength, God, and we’ll be strong!
PSA.68.28+PSA.68.29	For your miracles have made us who we are.
PSA.68.28+PSA.68.29	Lord, do it again,
PSA.68.28+PSA.68.29	and parade from your temple your mighty power.
PSA.68.28+PSA.68.29	By your command even kings will bring gifts to you.
PSA.68.30	God, rebuke the beast-life that hides within us!
PSA.68.30	Rebuke those who claim to be “strong ones,”
PSA.68.30	who lurk within the congregation
PSA.68.30	and abuse the people out of their love for money.
PSA.68.30	God scatters the people who are spoiling for a fight.
PSA.68.31	Africa will send her noble envoys to you, O God.
PSA.68.31	They will come running, stretching out their hands in love to you.
PSA.68.32	Let all the nations of the earth sing songs of praise to almighty God!
PSA.68.32	Go ahead, all you nations—sing your praise to the Lord!
PSA.68.32	Pause in his presence
PSA.68.33	Make music for the one who strides the ancient skies.
PSA.68.33	Listen to his thunderous voice of might split open the heavens.
PSA.68.34	Give it up for God, for he alone has all the strength and power!
PSA.68.34	Proclaim his majesty! For his glory shines down on Israel.
PSA.68.34	His mighty strength soars in the clouds of glory.
PSA.68.35	God, we are consumed with awe, trembling before you
PSA.68.35	as your glory streams from your Holy Place.
PSA.68.35	The God of power shares his mighty strength with Israel
PSA.68.35	and with all his people.
PSA.68.35	God, we give our highest praise to you!
PSA.69.1+PSA.69.2	God, my God, come and save me!
PSA.69.1+PSA.69.2	These floods of trouble have risen higher and higher.
PSA.69.1+PSA.69.2	The water is up to my neck!
PSA.69.1+PSA.69.2	I’m sinking into the mud with no place to stand,
PSA.69.1+PSA.69.2	and I’m about to drown in this storm.
PSA.69.3	I’m weary, exhausted with weeping.
PSA.69.3	My throat is dry, my voice is gone, my eyes are swollen with sorrow,
PSA.69.3	and I’m waiting for you, God, 
PSA.69.4	I can’t even count all those who hate me for no reason.
PSA.69.4	Many influential men want me silenced,
PSA.69.4	yet I’ve done nothing against them.
PSA.69.4	Must I restore what I never took away?
PSA.69.5	God, my life is an open book to you.
PSA.69.5	You know every sin I’ve ever done.
PSA.69.5	For nothing within me is hidden from your sight!
PSA.69.6	Lord Yahweh of Angel Armies,
PSA.69.6	keep me from ever being a stumbling block to others,
PSA.69.6	to those who love you.
PSA.69.6	Lord God of Israel, don’t let what happens to me
PSA.69.6	be the source of confusion to those who are passionate for you.
PSA.69.7	Because of my love for you, Lord,
PSA.69.7	I have been mocked, cursed, and disgraced.
PSA.69.8	Even my own brothers, those of my family,
PSA.69.8	act as though they don’t want anything to do with me.
PSA.69.9	My love for you has my heart on fire!
PSA.69.9	My passion consumes me for your house!
PSA.69.9	Nothing will turn me away,
PSA.69.9	even though I endure all the insults of those who insult you.
PSA.69.10	When they see me seeking for more of you with weeping and fasting,
PSA.69.10	they all just scoff and scorn at my passion.
PSA.69.11	When I humble myself with sorrow over my sin,
PSA.69.11	it gives them a reason to mock me even more.
PSA.69.12	The leaders, the influential ones—how they scorn my passion for you!
PSA.69.12	I’ve become the talk of the town, the theme of drunkards’ songs.
PSA.69.13	But I keep calling out to you, Yahweh!
PSA.69.13	I know you will bend down to listen to me,
PSA.69.13	for now is the season of favor.
PSA.69.13	Because of your faithful love for me,
PSA.69.13	your answer to my prayer will be my sure salvation.
PSA.69.14	Pull me out of this mess! Don’t let me sink!
PSA.69.14	Rescue me from those who hate me and from all this trouble I’m in!
PSA.69.15	Don’t let this flood drown me.
PSA.69.15	Save me from these deep waters
PSA.69.15	or I’ll go down to the pit of destruction.
PSA.69.16+PSA.69.17	Oh, Lord God, answer my prayers!
PSA.69.16+PSA.69.17	I need to see your tender kindness, your grace,
PSA.69.16+PSA.69.17	your compassion, and your constant love.
PSA.69.16+PSA.69.17	Just let me see your face, and turn your heart toward me.
PSA.69.16+PSA.69.17	Come running quickly to your servant.
PSA.69.16+PSA.69.17	In this deep distress, come and answer my prayer.
PSA.69.18	Come closer as a friend and redeem me.
PSA.69.18	Set me free so my enemies cannot say that you are powerless.
PSA.69.19	See how they dishonor me in shame and disgrace?
PSA.69.19	You know, Lord, what I’m going through, and you see it all.
PSA.69.20	I’m heartsick and heartbroken by it all.
PSA.69.20	Their contempt has crushed my soul.
PSA.69.20	I looked for sympathy and compassion
PSA.69.20	but found only empty stares.
PSA.69.21	I was hungry and they gave me bitter food.
PSA.69.21	I was thirsty and they offered me vinegar.
PSA.69.22	Let their “feasts” turn to ashes.
PSA.69.22	Let their “peace and security” become their downfall.
PSA.69.23	Make them blind as bats, groping in the dark.
PSA.69.23	Let them be feeble, trembling continually.
PSA.69.24+PSA.69.25	Pour out your fury on them all!
PSA.69.24+PSA.69.25	Consume them with the fire of your anger!
PSA.69.24+PSA.69.25	Burn down the walled palace where they live!
PSA.69.24+PSA.69.25	Leave them homeless and desolate!
PSA.69.26	For they come against the one you yourself have struck,
PSA.69.26	and they scorn the pain of those you’ve pierced.
PSA.69.27	Pile on them the guilt of their sins.
PSA.69.27	Don’t let them ever go free.
PSA.69.28	Leave them out of your list of the living!
PSA.69.28	Blot them out of your book of life!
PSA.69.28	Never name them as your own!
PSA.69.29	I am burdened and broken by this pain.
PSA.69.29	When your miracle rescue comes to me,
PSA.69.29	it will lift me to the highest place.
PSA.69.30	Then my song will be a burst of praise to you.
PSA.69.30	My glory-shouts will make your fame even more glorious
PSA.69.30	to all who hear my praises!
PSA.69.31	For I know, Yahweh, that my praises mean more to you
PSA.69.31	than all my gifts and sacrifices.
PSA.69.32	All who seek you will see God do this for them,
PSA.69.32	and they’ll overflow with gladness.
PSA.69.32	Let this revive your hearts, all you lovers of God!
PSA.69.33	For Yahweh does listen to the poor and needy
PSA.69.33	and will not abandon his prisoners of love.
PSA.69.34	Let all the universe praise him!
PSA.69.34	The high heavens and everyone on earth, praise him!
PSA.69.34	Let the oceans deep, with everything in them, keep it up!
PSA.69.35	God will come to save his Zion-people.
PSA.69.35	God will build up his cities of Judah,
PSA.69.35	for there his people will live in peace.
PSA.69.36	All their children will inherit the land,
PSA.69.36	and the lovers of his name will live there safe and secure.
PSA.70.1	Please, Lord! Come quickly and rescue me!
PSA.70.1	God, show me your favor and restore me.
PSA.70.2	Let all who seek my life be humiliated, confused, and ashamed.
PSA.70.2	God, send them sprawling, all who wish me evil;
PSA.70.2	they just want me dead.
PSA.70.3	Scoff at every scoffer and cause them all to be utter failures!
PSA.70.3	Let them be ashamed and horrified over their complete defeat.
PSA.70.4	But let all who passionately seek you erupt with excitement and joy
PSA.70.4	over what you’ve done!
PSA.70.4	Let all your lovers, who continually rejoice in the Savior,
PSA.70.4	say aloud, “How great and glorious is our God!”
PSA.70.5	Lord, in my place of weakness and need,
PSA.70.5	won’t you turn your heart toward me and hurry to help me?
PSA.70.5	For you are my Savior and I’m always in your thoughts.
PSA.70.5	So don’t delay to deliver me now, for you are my God.
PSA.71.1	Lord, you are my secure shelter. Don’t ever let me down!
PSA.71.2	Let your justice be my breakthrough.
PSA.71.2	Bend low to my whispered cry
PSA.71.2	and save me from all my enemies!
PSA.71.3	You’re the only place of protection for me.
PSA.71.3	I keep coming back to hide myself in you,
PSA.71.3	for you are like a mountain-cliff fortress where I’m kept safe.
PSA.71.4	Let me escape from these cruel and wicked men,
PSA.71.4	and save me from the hands of the evil one.
PSA.71.5	For you are my only hope, Lord!
PSA.71.5	I’ve hung on to you, trusting in you all my life.
PSA.71.6+PSA.71.7	It was you who supported me from the day I was born,
PSA.71.6+PSA.71.7	loving me, helping me through my life’s journey.
PSA.71.6+PSA.71.7	You’ve made me into a miracle;
PSA.71.6+PSA.71.7	no wonder I trust you and praise you forever!
PSA.71.6+PSA.71.7	Many marvel at my success,
PSA.71.6+PSA.71.7	but I know it is all because of you, my mighty protector!
PSA.71.8	I’m overflowing with your praise for all you’ve done,
PSA.71.8	and your splendor thrills me all day long.
PSA.71.9	Now that I’m old, don’t set me aside.
PSA.71.9	Don’t let go of me when my strength is spent.
PSA.71.10+PSA.71.11	For all my enemies whisper behind my back.
PSA.71.10+PSA.71.11	They’re waiting for me to fall so they can finish me off.
PSA.71.10+PSA.71.11	They’re convinced you’ve left me
PSA.71.10+PSA.71.11	and that you’ll never come to my rescue.
PSA.71.10+PSA.71.11	They’re saying, “Let’s get him now! He has no savior!”
PSA.71.12	O God, stay close to me!
PSA.71.12	Don’t just watch from a distance! Hurry to help me, my God!
PSA.71.13	Cover these accusers of mine with shame and failure!
PSA.71.13	Destroy them all, for they only want to kill me!
PSA.71.14	No matter what, I’ll trust in you to help me.
PSA.71.14	Nothing will stop me from praising you to magnify your glory!
PSA.71.15	I couldn’t begin to count the times you’ve been there for me.
PSA.71.15	With the skill of a poet I’ll never run out of things to say
PSA.71.15	of how you faithfully kept me from danger.
PSA.71.16	I will come forth in your mighty strength, O my Lord God.
PSA.71.16	I’ll tell everyone that you alone are the perfect one.
PSA.71.17	From my childhood you’ve been my teacher,
PSA.71.17	and I’m still telling everyone of your miracle-wonders!
PSA.71.18	God, now that I’m old and gray, don’t walk away.
PSA.71.18	Give me grace to demonstrate to the next generation
PSA.71.18	all your mighty miracles and your excitement,
PSA.71.18	to show them your magnificent power!
PSA.71.19	For your glorious righteousness reaches up to the high heavens.
PSA.71.19	No one could ever be compared to you!
PSA.71.19	Who is your equal, O God of marvels and wonders?
PSA.71.20	Even though you’ve let us sink down with trials and troubles,
PSA.71.20	I know you will revive us again,
PSA.71.20	lifting us up from the dust of death.
PSA.71.21	Give us even more greatness than before.
PSA.71.21	Turn and comfort us once again.
PSA.71.22	My loving God, the harp in my heart will praise you.
PSA.71.22	Your faithful heart toward us will be the theme of my song.
PSA.71.22	Melodies and music will rise to you, the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	I will shout and sing your praises for all you are to me—
PSA.71.23	Savior, lover of my soul!
PSA.71.24	I’ll never stop telling others how perfect you are
PSA.71.24	while all those who seek my harm slink away ashamed and defeated!
PSA.72.1	O God, make the king a godly judge like you
PSA.72.1	and give the king’s son the gift of justice too.
PSA.72.2	Help him to give true justice to your people,
PSA.72.2	honorably and equally to all.
PSA.72.3	Then the mountains of influence will be fruitful,
PSA.72.3	and from your righteousness
PSA.72.3	prosperity and peace will flow to all the people.
PSA.72.4	May the poor and humble have an advocate with the king.
PSA.72.4	May he consider the children of the poor
PSA.72.4	and crush the cruel oppressor.
PSA.72.5	The sun and moon will stop shining
PSA.72.5	before your lovers will stop worshiping;
PSA.72.5	for ages upon ages the people will love and adore you!
PSA.72.6	Your favor will fall like rain upon our surrendered lives,
PSA.72.6	like showers reviving the earth.
PSA.72.7	In the days of his reign the righteous will spring forth
PSA.72.7	with the abundance of peace and prosperity forevermore.
PSA.72.8	May he subdue and take dominion from sea to sea;
PSA.72.8	may he rule from the river to the rim.
PSA.72.9	Desert nomads are bowing at his feet,
PSA.72.9	every enemy falling facedown, biting the dust!
PSA.72.10	Distant kings will surrender and come with their gifts
PSA.72.10	from every continent and coastland;
PSA.72.10	they will offer their tribute to you.
PSA.72.11	O King of kings, they will all bow before you.
PSA.72.11	O King of kings, every nation will one day serve you.
PSA.72.12+PSA.72.13	He will care for the needy and neglected
PSA.72.12+PSA.72.13	when they cry to him for help.
PSA.72.12+PSA.72.13	The humble and helpless will know his kindness,
PSA.72.12+PSA.72.13	for with a father’s compassion he will save their souls.
PSA.72.14	They will be rescued from tyranny and torture,
PSA.72.14	for their lifeblood is precious in his eyes.
PSA.72.15	Long live this King!
PSA.72.15	May the wealth of the world be laid before him.
PSA.72.15	May there be ceaseless praise and prayer to him.
PSA.72.15	May all the blessing be brought to him.
PSA.72.16	Bless us with a bountiful harvest,
PSA.72.16	with golden grain swaying on the mountain fields!
PSA.72.16	May the cities be full of praising people, fruitful and filled—
PSA.72.17	So that his name may be honored forever!
PSA.72.17	May the fame of his name spring forth!
PSA.72.17	May it shine on, like the sunshine!
PSA.72.17	In him all will be blessed to bless others,
PSA.72.17	and may all the people bless the One who blessed them.
PSA.72.18	Praise forever Jehovah-God, the God of Israel!
PSA.72.18	He is the one and only God of wonders,
PSA.72.18	surpassing every expectation.
PSA.72.19	The blazing glory of his name will be praised forever!
PSA.72.19	May all the earth overflow with his glory!
PSA.72.19	Faithful is our King! Amen!
PSA.72.20	This concludes the poetry sung by David, Jesse’s son.
PSA.73.1	No one can deny it—God is really good to Israel
PSA.73.1	and to all those with pure hearts.
PSA.73.2	Here’s my story: I narrowly missed losing it all.
PSA.73.3	I was stumbling over what I saw with the wicked.
PSA.73.3	For when I saw the boasters with such wealth and prosperity,
PSA.73.3	I became jealous over their smug security.
PSA.73.4+PSA.73.5	Indulging in whatever they wanted, going where they wanted,
PSA.73.4+PSA.73.5	doing what they wanted, and with no care in the world.
PSA.73.4+PSA.73.5	No pain, no problems, they seemed to have it made.
PSA.73.4+PSA.73.5	They lived as though life would never end.
PSA.73.6	They didn’t even try to hide their pride and opulence.
PSA.73.6	Cruelty and violence is part of their lifestyle.
PSA.73.7	Pampered and pompous, vice oozes from their souls;
PSA.73.7	they overflow with vanity.
PSA.73.8	They’re such snobs—looking down their noses.
PSA.73.8	They even scoff at God!
PSA.73.8	They are nothing but bullies threatening God’s people.
PSA.73.9	Loudmouths with no fear of God, pretending to know it all.
PSA.73.9	Windbags full of hot air, impressing only themselves.
PSA.73.10	Yet the people keep coming back to listen
PSA.73.10	to more of their nonsense.
PSA.73.11	They tell their cohorts, “God will never know.
PSA.73.11	See, he has no clue of what we’re doing.”
PSA.73.12	These are the wicked ones I’m talking about!
PSA.73.12	They never have to lift a finger,
PSA.73.12	living a life of ease while their riches multiply.
PSA.73.13	Have I been foolish to play by the rules and keep my life pure?
PSA.73.14	Here I am suffering under your discipline day after day.
PSA.73.14	I feel like I’m being punished all day long.
PSA.73.15	If I had given in to my pain and spoken of what I was really feeling,
PSA.73.15	it would have sounded like unfaithfulness to the next generation.
PSA.73.16	When I tried to understand it all, I just couldn’t.
PSA.73.16	It was too puzzling—too much of a riddle to me.
PSA.73.17	But then one day I was brought into the sanctuaries of God,
PSA.73.17	and in the light of glory, my distorted perspective vanished.
PSA.73.17	Then I understood that the destiny of the wicked was near!
PSA.73.18	They’re the ones who are on the slippery path,
PSA.73.18	and God will suddenly let them slide off into destruction
PSA.73.18	to be consumed with terrors forever!
PSA.73.19	It will be an instant end to all their life of ease;
PSA.73.19	a blink of the eye and they’re swept away by sudden calamity!
PSA.73.19	They’re all nothing more than momentary monarchs—
PSA.73.20	soon to disappear like a dream when one awakes.
PSA.73.20	When the rooster crows,
PSA.73.20	Lord God, you’ll despise their life of fantasies.
PSA.73.21	When I saw all of this, what turmoil filled my heart,
PSA.73.21	piercing my opinions with your truth.
PSA.73.22	I was so stupid. I was senseless and ignorant,
PSA.73.22	acting like a brute beast before you, Lord.
PSA.73.23	Yet, in spite of all this, you comfort me by your counsel;
PSA.73.23	you draw me closer to you.
PSA.73.24	You lead me with your secret wisdom.
PSA.73.24	And following you brings me into your brightness and glory!
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but you? You’re all I want!
PSA.73.25	No one on earth means as much to me as you.
PSA.73.26	Lord, so many times I fail; I fall into disgrace.
PSA.73.26	But when I trust in you, I have a strong and glorious presence
PSA.73.26	protecting and anointing me. Forever you’re all I need!
PSA.73.27	Those who abandon the worship of God will perish.
PSA.73.27	The false and unfaithful will be silenced, never heard from again.
PSA.73.28	But I’ll keep coming closer and closer to you, Lord Yahweh,
PSA.73.28	for your name is good to me. I’ll keep telling the world of
PSA.73.28	your awesome works, my faithful and glorious God!
PSA.74.1	Are you really going to leave us, God?
PSA.74.1	Would you turn your back on us, rejecting your people?
PSA.74.1	We are yours, your very own.
PSA.74.1	Will your anger smolder against us forever?
PSA.74.2	Don’t forget that we are your beloved ones.
PSA.74.2	Wrap us back into your heart again, for you chose us.
PSA.74.2	You brought us out of our slavery and bondage
PSA.74.2	and made us your favored ones, your Zion-people,
PSA.74.2	your home on earth.
PSA.74.3	Turn your steps toward this devastation.
PSA.74.3	Come running to bring your restoring grace to these ruins,
PSA.74.3	to what the enemy has done to devastate your Holy Place.
PSA.74.4	They have come into the very midst of your dwelling place,
PSA.74.4	roaring like beasts, setting up their banners to flaunt their conquest.
PSA.74.5	Now everything is in shambles! They’ve totally destroyed it.
PSA.74.5	Like a forest chopped down to the ground,
PSA.74.5	there’s nothing’s left.
PSA.74.6	All of the beauty of the craftsmanship
PSA.74.6	of the inner place has been ruined,
PSA.74.6	smashed, broken, and shattered.
PSA.74.7	They’ve burned it all to the ground.
PSA.74.7	They’ve violated your sanctuary,
PSA.74.7	the very dwelling place of your glory and your name.
PSA.74.8	They boasted, “Let’s completely crush them!
PSA.74.8	Let’s wipe out every trace of this God.
PSA.74.8	Let’s burn up every sacred place where they worship this God.”
PSA.74.9	We don’t see any miraculous signs anymore.
PSA.74.9	There’s no longer a prophet among us
PSA.74.9	who can tell us how long this devastation will continue.
PSA.74.10	God, how much longer will you let this go on
PSA.74.10	and allow these barbarians to blaspheme your name?
PSA.74.10	Will you stand back and watch them get away with this forever?
PSA.74.11	Why don’t you do something?
PSA.74.11	You have the power to break in,
PSA.74.11	so why would you hide your great power from us?
PSA.74.11	Don’t hold back! Unleash your might and give them a final blow.
PSA.74.12	You have always been, and always will be, my King.
PSA.74.12	You are the mighty conqueror, working wonders all over the world.
PSA.74.13	It was you who split the sea in two by your glorious strength.
PSA.74.13	You smashed the power of Tannin, the sea monster.
PSA.74.14	You crushed the might of Leviathan, the great dragon,
PSA.74.14	then you took the crumbs and fed them to the sharks.
PSA.74.15	With your glory you opened up springs and fountains,
PSA.74.15	then you spoke and the ever-flowing springs of Jordan
PSA.74.15	dried up so we could cross over.
PSA.74.16	You own the day and the night.
PSA.74.16	Sunlight and starlight call you Creator.
PSA.74.17	The four corners of the earth were formed by your hands,
PSA.74.17	and every changing season owes its beauty to you.
PSA.74.18	O Jehovah, don’t ever forget how these arrogant enemies,
PSA.74.18	like fools, have mocked your name.
PSA.74.19	Lord, aren’t we your beloved dove that praises you?
PSA.74.19	Protect us from these wild beasts who want to harm us.
PSA.74.19	Don’t leave us as lambs among wolves!
PSA.74.19	You can’t abandon us after all we’ve been through!
PSA.74.20	Remember your promises to us,
PSA.74.20	for darkness covers the land,
PSA.74.20	giving the violent ones a hiding place.
PSA.74.21	Don’t let these insults continue.
PSA.74.21	Can’t you see that we are your downtrodden
PSA.74.21	and oppressed people?
PSA.74.21	Make the poor and needy into a choir of praise to you!
PSA.74.22	Don’t ignore these ignorant words, this continual mocking.
PSA.74.22	Rise up, God; it’s time to defend yourself from all of this.
PSA.74.23	Never forget what your adversaries are saying.
PSA.74.23	For their rage and uproar rise continually against you.
PSA.75.1	God, our hearts spill over with praise to you!
PSA.75.1	We overflow with thanks, for your name is the “Near One.”
PSA.75.1	All we want to talk about is your wonderful works!
PSA.75.1	And we hear your reply:
PSA.75.2	“When the time is ripe I will arise,
PSA.75.2	and I will judge the world with perfect righteousness.
PSA.75.3	Though I have set the earth firmly on its pillars,
PSA.75.3	I will shake it until it totters and everyone’s hearts will tremble.”
PSA.75.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.75.4	God warns the proud, “Stop your arrogant boasting!”
PSA.75.4	And he warns the wicked,
PSA.75.4	“Don’t think for a moment you can resist me!
PSA.75.5	Why would you speak with such stubborn pride?
PSA.75.5	Don’t you dare raise your fist against me!”
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	This I know:
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	the favor that brings promotion and power
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	doesn’t come from anywhere on earth,
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	for no one exalts a person but God, the true judge of all.
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	He alone determines where favor rests.
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	He anoints one for greatness
PSA.75.6+PSA.75.7	and brings another down to his knees.
PSA.75.8	A foaming cup filled with judgment mixed with fury
PSA.75.8	is in the hands of the Lord Jehovah,
PSA.75.8	full to the brim and ready to run over.
PSA.75.8	He filled it up for the wicked and they will drink it
PSA.75.8	down to the very last drop!
PSA.75.9	But I will proclaim the victory of the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.9	My melodies of praise will make him known.
PSA.75.10	My praises will break the powers of wickedness
PSA.75.10	while the righteous will be promoted and become powerful!
PSA.76.1	God is well known in the land of Judah.
PSA.76.1	He is famous throughout Israel,
PSA.76.2	making his home in Jerusalem, living here on Mount Zion.
PSA.76.3	That’s where he smashes every weapon of war
PSA.76.3	that comes against him.
PSA.76.3	That’s where he uses the broken arrows
PSA.76.3	as kindling for his mighty bonfire.
PSA.76.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.76.4	God, you are so resplendent and radiant!
PSA.76.4	Your majesty shines from your everlasting mountain.
PSA.76.4	Nothing could be compared to you in glory!
PSA.76.5	Even the mightiest of men have been paralyzed by your presence.
PSA.76.5	They were so stunned and lifeless,
PSA.76.5	not even the strongest one could lift a hand.
PSA.76.6	When Jacob’s God roared his rebuke,
PSA.76.6	soldiers and their steeds all fell to the ground,
PSA.76.6	stunned and lying still.
PSA.76.7	No wonder you are greatly feared! You are the awe-inspiring God!
PSA.76.7	For who could ever stand before your face
PSA.76.7	when your fierce anger burns and live to tell about it.
PSA.76.8	As the earth itself holds its breath in awe before you,
PSA.76.8	judgment is decreed from heaven.
PSA.76.9	You arise to punish evil and defend the gentle upon the earth.
PSA.76.9	Pause in his presence
PSA.76.10	You have power to transform man’s futile anger into praise.
PSA.76.10	The fury of your enemies only causes your fame to increase.
PSA.76.11	So you’d better keep every promise you’ve ever made
PSA.76.11	to the Awesome One, Jehovah-God!
PSA.76.11	Let all people bring their extravagant gifts to him alone.
PSA.76.12	He is famous for breaking the spirit of the powers that be.
PSA.76.12	And the kings of the earth will know him as the Fearsome One!
PSA.77.1	I poured out my complaint to you, God.
PSA.77.1	I lifted up my voice, shouting out for your help.
PSA.77.2	When I was in deep distress, in my day of trouble,
PSA.77.2	I reached out for you with hands stretched out to heaven.
PSA.77.2	Over and over I kept looking for you, God,
PSA.77.2	but your comforting grace was nowhere to be found.
PSA.77.3	As I thought of you I moaned, “God, where are you?”
PSA.77.3	I’m overwhelmed with despair as I wait for your help to arrive.
PSA.77.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.77.4	I can’t get a wink of sleep until you come and comfort me.
PSA.77.4	Now I’m too burdened to even pray!
PSA.77.5	My mind wandered, thinking of days gone by—
PSA.77.5	the years long since passed.
PSA.77.6	Then I remembered the worship songs I used to sing
PSA.77.6	in the night seasons,
PSA.77.6	and my heart began to fill again with thoughts of you.
PSA.77.6	So my spirit went out once more in search of you.
PSA.77.7	Would you really walk off and leave me forever, my Lord God?
PSA.77.7	Won’t you show me your kind favor, delighting in me again?
PSA.77.8	Has your well of sweet mercy dried up?
PSA.77.8	Will your promises never come true?
PSA.77.9	Have you somehow forgotten to show me love?
PSA.77.9	Are you so angry that you’ve closed
PSA.77.9	your heart of compassion toward me?
PSA.77.9	Pause in his presence
PSA.77.10	Lord, what wounds me most is that it’s somehow my fault that
PSA.77.10	you’ve changed your heart toward me
PSA.77.10	and I no longer see the years of the Mighty One
PSA.77.10	and your right hand of power.
PSA.77.11	Yet I could never forget all your miracles, my God,
PSA.77.11	as I remember all your wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I ponder all you’ve done, Lord, musing on all your miracles.
PSA.77.13	It’s here in your presence, in your sanctuary,
PSA.77.13	where I learn more of your ways.
PSA.77.13	For holiness is revealed in everything you do.
PSA.77.13	Lord, you’re the one and only, the great and glorious God!
PSA.77.14	Your display of wonders, miracles, and power
PSA.77.14	makes the nations acknowledge you.
PSA.77.15	By your glory-bursts you’ve rescued us over and over.
PSA.77.15	Just ask the sons of Jacob or
PSA.77.15	the sons of Joseph and they will tell you!
PSA.77.15	And all of us, your beloved ones, know that it’s true!
PSA.77.15	Pause in his presence
PSA.77.16	When the many waters of the Red Sea took one look at you,
PSA.77.16	they were afraid and ran away to hide—
PSA.77.16	trembling to its depths!
PSA.77.17	Storm clouds filled with water high in the skies;
PSA.77.17	cloudbursts and thunderclaps announced your approach.
PSA.77.17	Lightning-flashes lit up the landscape.
PSA.77.18	Rolling whirlwinds exploded with sonic booms of thunder,
PSA.77.18	rumbling as the skies shouted out your story
PSA.77.18	with light and sound and wind.
PSA.77.18	Everything on earth shook and trembled as you drew near.
PSA.77.19	Your steps formed a highway through the seas
PSA.77.19	with footprints on a pathway no one even knew was there.
PSA.77.20	You led your people forward by your loving hand,
PSA.77.20	blessed by the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Beloved ones, listen to this instruction.
PSA.78.1	Open your heart to the revelation
PSA.78.1	of this mystery that I share with you.
PSA.78.2	A parable and a proverb are hidden in what I say—
PSA.78.2	an intriguing riddle from the past.
PSA.78.3+PSA.78.4	We’ve heard true stories from our fathers about our rich heritage.
PSA.78.3+PSA.78.4	We will continue to tell our children
PSA.78.3+PSA.78.4	and not hide from the rising generation
PSA.78.3+PSA.78.4	the great marvels of our God—
PSA.78.3+PSA.78.4	his miracles and power that have brought us all this far.
PSA.78.5	The story of Israel is a lesson in God’s ways.
PSA.78.5	He established decrees for Jacob and established the law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	and he commanded our forefathers to teach them to their children.
PSA.78.6	For perpetuity God’s ways will be passed down
PSA.78.6	from one generation to the next, even to those not yet born.
PSA.78.7	In this way, every generation will have a living faith in the laws of life
PSA.78.7	and will never forget the faithful ways of God.
PSA.78.8	By following his ways they will break the past bondage
PSA.78.8	of their fickle fathers, who were a stubborn, rebellious generation
PSA.78.8	and whose spirits strayed from the eternal God.
PSA.78.8	They refused to love him with all their hearts.
PSA.78.9	Take, for example, the sons of Ephraim.
PSA.78.9	Though they were all equipped warriors, each with weapons,
PSA.78.9	when the battle began they retreated and ran away in fear.
PSA.78.10	They didn’t really believe the promises of God;
PSA.78.10	they refused to trust him and move forward in faith.
PSA.78.11	They forgot his wonderful works and the miracles of the past,
PSA.78.12	even their exodus from Egypt, the epic miracle of his might.
PSA.78.12	They forgot the glories of his power at the place of passing over.
PSA.78.13	God split the sea wide open, and
PSA.78.13	the waters stood at attention on either side
PSA.78.13	as the people passed on through!
PSA.78.14	By day the moving glory-cloud led them forward.
PSA.78.14	And all through the night the fire-cloud stood as a sentry of light.
PSA.78.15+PSA.78.16	In the days of desert dryness he split open the mighty rock,
PSA.78.15+PSA.78.16	and the waters flowed like a river before their very eyes.
PSA.78.15+PSA.78.16	He gave them all they wanted to drink from his living springs.
PSA.78.17	Yet they kept their rebellion alive against God Most High,
PSA.78.17	and their sins against God continued to be counted.
PSA.78.18	In their hearts they tested God just to get what they wanted,
PSA.78.18	asking for the food their hearts craved.
PSA.78.19+PSA.78.20	Like spoiled children they grumbled against God,
PSA.78.19+PSA.78.20	 by saying,
PSA.78.19+PSA.78.20	“Can’t God provide for us in this barren wilderness?
PSA.78.19+PSA.78.20	Will he give us food, or will he only give us water?
PSA.78.19+PSA.78.20	Where’s our meal?”
PSA.78.21	Then God heard all their complaining and was furious!
PSA.78.21	His anger flared up against his people.
PSA.78.22	For they turned away from faith and walked away in fear;
PSA.78.22	they failed to trust in his power to help them when he was near.
PSA.78.23+PSA.78.24	Still he spoke on their behalf and the skies opened up;
PSA.78.23+PSA.78.24	the windows of heaven poured out food,
PSA.78.23+PSA.78.24	the mercy bread-manna.
PSA.78.23+PSA.78.24	The grain of grace fell from the clouds.
PSA.78.25	Humans ate angels’ food—the meal of the mighty ones.
PSA.78.25	His grace gave them more than enough!
PSA.78.26+PSA.78.27	The heavenly winds of miracle power blew in their favor
PSA.78.26+PSA.78.27	and food rained down upon them;
PSA.78.26+PSA.78.27	succulent quail quieted their hunger as they ate all they wanted.
PSA.78.28	Food fell from the skies, thick as clouds;
PSA.78.28	their provision floated down right in front of their eyes!
PSA.78.29	He gave them all they desired, and they ate to their fill.
PSA.78.30+PSA.78.31	But before they had even finished,
PSA.78.30+PSA.78.31	even with their food still in their mouths,
PSA.78.30+PSA.78.31	God’s fiery anger arose against them,
PSA.78.30+PSA.78.31	killing the finest of their mighty men.
PSA.78.32	Yet in spite of all this, they kept right on sinning.
PSA.78.32	Even when they saw God’s marvels,
PSA.78.32	they refused to believe God could care for them.
PSA.78.33	So God cut their lives short with sudden disaster,
PSA.78.33	with nothing to show for their lives but fear and failure.
PSA.78.34	,
PSA.78.34	but when he began to kill them, ending their lives in a moment,
PSA.78.34	they came running back to God, pleading for mercy.
PSA.78.35	They remembered that God, the Mighty One,
PSA.78.35	was their strong protector,
PSA.78.35	the Hero-God who would come to their rescue.
PSA.78.36+PSA.78.37	But their repentance lasted only as long as they were in danger;
PSA.78.36+PSA.78.37	they lied through their teeth to the true God of Covenant.
PSA.78.36+PSA.78.37	So quickly they wandered away from his promises,
PSA.78.36+PSA.78.37	following God with their words and not their hearts!
PSA.78.36+PSA.78.37	Their worship was only flattery.
PSA.78.38	But amazingly, God—so full of compassion—still forgave them.
PSA.78.38	He covered over their sins with his love,
PSA.78.38	refusing to destroy them all.
PSA.78.38	Over and over he held back his anger,
PSA.78.38	restraining wrath to show them mercy.
PSA.78.39	He knew that they were made from mere dust—
PSA.78.39	frail, fragile, and short-lived, here today and gone tomorrow.
PSA.78.40	How many times they rebelled in their desert days!
PSA.78.40	How they grieved him with their grumblings.
PSA.78.41	Again and again they limited God, preventing him from blessing them.
PSA.78.41	Continually they turned back from him
PSA.78.41	and provoked the Holy One of Israel!
PSA.78.42	They forgot his great love, how he took them by his hand,
PSA.78.42	and 
PSA.78.43	They disregarded all the epic signs and marvels they saw
PSA.78.43	when they escaped from Egypt’s bondage.
PSA.78.43	They forgot the judgment of the plagues that set them free.
PSA.78.44	God turned their rivers into blood, leaving the people thirsty.
PSA.78.45	He sent them vast swarms of filthy flies that sucked their blood.
PSA.78.45	He sent hordes of frogs, ruining their lives.
PSA.78.46	Grasshoppers consumed all their crops.
PSA.78.47	Every garden and every orchard
PSA.78.47	was flattened with blasts of hailstones,
PSA.78.47	their fruit trees ruined by a killing frost.
PSA.78.48	Even their cattle fell prey, pounded by the falling hail;
PSA.78.48	their livestock were struck with bolts of lightning.
PSA.78.49	Finally, he unleashed upon them the fierceness of his anger.
PSA.78.49	Such fury!
PSA.78.49	He sent them sorrow and devastating trouble
PSA.78.49	by his mighty band of destroying angels;
PSA.78.49	messengers of death were dispatched against them.
PSA.78.50+PSA.78.51	He lifted his mercy and let loose his fearful anger
PSA.78.50+PSA.78.51	and did not spare their lives.
PSA.78.50+PSA.78.51	He released the judgment-plagues to rage through their land.
PSA.78.50+PSA.78.51	God struck down in death all the firstborn sons of Egypt—
PSA.78.50+PSA.78.51	the pride and joy of each family.
PSA.78.52	Then, like a shepherd leading his sheep, God led his people
PSA.78.52	out of tyranny, guiding them through the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	Safely and carefully God led them out, with nothing to fear.
PSA.78.53	But their enemies he led into the sea.
PSA.78.53	He took care of them there once and for all!
PSA.78.54	Eventually God brought his people to the Holy Land,
PSA.78.54	to a land of hills that he had prepared for them.
PSA.78.55	He drove out and scattered all the peoples occupying the land,
PSA.78.55	staking out an inheritance, a portion for each of Israel’s tribes.
PSA.78.56	Yet for all of this, they still rebelled and refused to follow his ways,
PSA.78.56	provoking to anger the God Most High.
PSA.78.57+PSA.78.58	Like traitors turning back, they forsook him.
PSA.78.57+PSA.78.58	They were even worse than their fathers!
PSA.78.57+PSA.78.58	They became treacherous deceivers, crooked and corrupt,
PSA.78.57+PSA.78.58	and worshiped false gods in the high places,
PSA.78.57+PSA.78.58	bringing low the name of God with every idol they erected.
PSA.78.57+PSA.78.58	No wonder he was filled with jealousy and furious with anger!
PSA.78.59	Enraged with anger, God turned his wrath on them,
PSA.78.59	and he rejected his people with disgust.
PSA.78.60	God walked away from them and left his dwelling place at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	abandoning the place where he had lived among them,
PSA.78.61	allowing his emblem of strength, his glory-ark to be captured.
PSA.78.61	Enemies stole the very source of Israel’s power.
PSA.78.62	God vented his rage, allowing his people to be butchered
PSA.78.62	when they went out to battle,
PSA.78.62	for his anger was intense against his very own.
PSA.78.63	Their young men fell on the battlefield and never came back.
PSA.78.63	Their daughters never heard their wedding songs
PSA.78.63	since there was no one left to marry!
PSA.78.64	Their priests were slaughtered and their widows were killed
PSA.78.64	before they had time to weep.
PSA.78.65	Then all at once the Almighty awakened
PSA.78.65	as though he had been asleep.
PSA.78.65	Like a mighty man he arose, roaring into action!
PSA.78.66	He blasted into battle, driving back every foe,
PSA.78.66	defeating them in disgrace for time and eternity.
PSA.78.67	He rejected Joseph’s family, the tribe of Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	He chose instead the tribe of Judah
PSA.78.68	and Mount Zion, which he loves.
PSA.78.69	There he built his towering temple,
PSA.78.69	strong and enduring as the earth itself.
PSA.78.70	God also chose his beloved one, David.
PSA.78.70	He promoted him from caring for sheep
PSA.78.70	and made him his prophetic servant.
PSA.78.71+PSA.78.72	God prepared David and took this gentle shepherd-king
PSA.78.71+PSA.78.72	and presented him before the people
PSA.78.71+PSA.78.72	as the one who would love and care for them
PSA.78.71+PSA.78.72	with integrity, a pure heart, and the anointing
PSA.78.71+PSA.78.72	to lead Israel, his holy inheritance.
PSA.79.1	God, won’t you do something?
PSA.79.1	Barbarians have invaded your inheritance.
PSA.79.1	Your temple of holiness has been violated,
PSA.79.1	and Jerusalem has been left in ruins.
PSA.79.2	The corpses of your loving people are lying in the open—
PSA.79.2	food for the beasts and the birds.
PSA.79.3	The shed blood of your servants has soaked the city,
PSA.79.3	with no one left to bury the dead.
PSA.79.4	Now the nearby nations heap their scorn upon us,
PSA.79.4	scoffing, mocking us incessantly.
PSA.79.5	How much longer, O Jehovah-God, must we endure this?
PSA.79.5	Does your anger have no end?
PSA.79.5	Will your jealousy burn like a raging fire?
PSA.79.6	If you’re going to pour out your anger,
PSA.79.6	pour it out on all these nations around us, not on us!
PSA.79.6	They’re the ones who do not love you like we do!
PSA.79.7	See how they’ve attacked us, consuming the land,
PSA.79.7	leaving it desolate.
PSA.79.8	Please, God, don’t hold the sins of our fathers against us.
PSA.79.8	Don’t make us pay for their sins.
PSA.79.8	Hurry to our side, and let your tenderhearted mercy
PSA.79.8	meet us in our need, for we are devastated beyond belief.
PSA.79.9	Our hero, come and rescue us!
PSA.79.9	O God of the breakthrough, for the glory of your name,
PSA.79.9	come and help us!
PSA.79.9	Forgive and restore us; heal us and cover us in your love.
PSA.79.10	Why should all the nations sneer at us, saying,
PSA.79.10	“Where is this God of yours?”
PSA.79.10	Now is the time, Lord.
PSA.79.10	Show your people and all the world that
PSA.79.10	you will avenge this slaughter and bloodshed once and for all!
PSA.79.11	Listen, Lord! Hear the sighing of all the prisoners of war,
PSA.79.11	all those doomed to die. Demonstrate your glory-power,
PSA.79.11	and come and rescue your condemned children!
PSA.79.12	Lord God, take what these mocking masses have done to us
PSA.79.12	and pay it all back to them seven times over.
PSA.79.13	Then we, your lovers, will forever thank you,
PSA.79.13	praising your name from generation to generation!
PSA.80.1	God-Enthroned, be revealed in splendor
PSA.80.1	as you ride upon the cherubim!
PSA.80.1	How perfectly you lead us, a people set free.
PSA.80.1	Loving shepherd of Israel—listen to our hearts’ cry!
PSA.80.1	Shine forth from your throne of dazzling light.
PSA.80.2	In the sight of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh,
PSA.80.2	stir up your mighty power in full display before our eyes.
PSA.80.2	Break through and reveal yourself by coming to our rescue.
PSA.80.3	Revive us, O God! Let your beaming face shine upon us
PSA.80.3	with the sunrise rays of glory;
PSA.80.3	then nothing will be able to stop us.
PSA.80.4	O God, the mighty Commander of Angel Armies,
PSA.80.4	how much longer will you smolder in anger?
PSA.80.4	How much longer will you be disgusted with your people
PSA.80.4	even when they pray?
PSA.80.5	You have fed us with sorrow and grief
PSA.80.5	and made us drink our tears by the bowlful.
PSA.80.6	You’ve made us a thorn in the side of all the neighboring lands,
PSA.80.6	and now they just laugh at us with their mocking scorn.
PSA.80.7	Come back, come back, O God, and restore us!
PSA.80.7	You are the Commander of Angel Armies.
PSA.80.7	Let your beaming face shine upon us with the sunrise rays of glory,
PSA.80.7	and then nothing will be able to stop us!
PSA.80.8+PSA.80.9	Remember how you transplanted us here
PSA.80.8+PSA.80.9	like a tender vine from Egypt.
PSA.80.8+PSA.80.9	You cleared the land for your vineyard,
PSA.80.8+PSA.80.9	evicting the nations from your land and planting us here.
PSA.80.8+PSA.80.9	The roots of your vineyard went deep into the soil
PSA.80.8+PSA.80.9	and filled the land with fruit.
PSA.80.10+PSA.80.11	Because of your favor on your vineyard,
PSA.80.10+PSA.80.11	blessing extended to every mountain of influence.
PSA.80.10+PSA.80.11	Through this flourishing vineyard mighty ones were raised up.
PSA.80.10+PSA.80.11	The nations were blessed by your fruitful vineyard of Israel,
PSA.80.10+PSA.80.11	all the way from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates.
PSA.80.12+PSA.80.13	So Lord, why have you broken down
PSA.80.12+PSA.80.13	your fence of favor around us?
PSA.80.12+PSA.80.13	Trespassers can steal the fruit from off our vines,
PSA.80.12+PSA.80.13	and now every wild beast comes
PSA.80.12+PSA.80.13	breaking through our wall to ravage us.
PSA.80.12+PSA.80.13	You’ve left us without protection!
PSA.80.14	Come back, come back, O God to restore us!
PSA.80.14	You are the Commander of Angel Armies.
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see our crisis.
PSA.80.14	Come down and care for your lovely vineyard once again.
PSA.80.15	Nurture our root and our fruit with your loving care.
PSA.80.15	Raise up the Branch-Man, the Son whom you’ve made strong.
PSA.80.16	Enemies chopped down our vine and set it on fire;
PSA.80.16	now show them your anger and let them perish by your frown.
PSA.80.17	Strengthen this Branch-Man, the Son of your love,
PSA.80.17	the Son of Man who dwells at your right hand.
PSA.80.18	Then we will never turn back from you.
PSA.80.18	Revive us again, that we may trust in you.
PSA.80.19	O God, the mighty Commander of Angel Armies,
PSA.80.19	come back and rescue us!
PSA.80.19	Let your beaming face shine upon us
PSA.80.19	with the sunrise rays of glory.
PSA.80.19	Then nothing will ever stop us again!
PSA.81.1	Lord, just singing about you makes me strong!
PSA.81.1	So I’ll keep shouting for joy to Jacob’s God, my champion.
PSA.81.2	Let the celebration begin!
PSA.81.2	I will sing with drum accompaniment and with the sweet sound
PSA.81.2	of the harp and guitar strumming.
PSA.81.3	Go ahead! Blow the jubilee trumpet to begin the feast!
PSA.81.3	Blow it before every joyous celebration and festival.
PSA.81.4	For God has given us these seasons of joy,
PSA.81.4	days that the God of Jacob decreed for us to celebrate and rejoice.
PSA.81.5	He has given these feasts to remind us of his triumph over Egypt,
PSA.81.5	when he went out to wage war against them.
PSA.81.5	I heard the message in an unknown tongue as he said to me,
PSA.81.6	“I have removed your backbreaking burdens
PSA.81.6	and have freed your hands from the hard labor and toil.
PSA.81.7	You called out to me in your time of trouble and I rescued you.
PSA.81.7	I came down from the realm of the secret place of thunder,
PSA.81.7	where mysteries hide.
PSA.81.7	I came down to save you.
PSA.81.7	I tested your hearts at the place where there was no water to drink,
PSA.81.7	the place of your bitter argument with me.”
PSA.81.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.81.8	“Listen to me, my dear people.
PSA.81.8	For I’m warning you, and you’d better listen well!
PSA.81.8	For I hold something against you.
PSA.81.9	Don’t ever be guilty of worshiping any other god but me.
PSA.81.10	I am your only God, the living God.
PSA.81.10	Wasn’t I the one who broke the strongholds over you
PSA.81.10	and raised you up out of bondage?
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth with a mighty decree;
PSA.81.10	I will fulfill it now, you’ll see!
PSA.81.10	The words that you speak, so shall it be!
PSA.81.11	But my people still wouldn’t listen;
PSA.81.11	my princely people would not yield to me.
PSA.81.12	So I lifted my grace from off of their lives and I surrendered them
PSA.81.12	to the stubbornness of their hearts.
PSA.81.12	For they were living according to their own selfish fantasies.
PSA.81.13	O that my people would once and for all listen to me
PSA.81.13	and walk faithfully in my footsteps, following my ways.
PSA.81.14	Then and only then will I conquer your every foe
PSA.81.14	and tell every one of them, ‘You must go!’
PSA.81.15	Those who hate my ways will cringe before me
PSA.81.15	and their punishment will be eternal.
PSA.81.16	But I will feed you with my spiritual bread.
PSA.81.16	You will feast and be satisfied with me,
PSA.81.16	feeding on my revelation-truth like honey
PSA.81.16	dripping from the cliffs of the high place.”
PSA.82.1	All rise! For God now comes to judge
PSA.82.1	as he convenes heaven’s courtroom.
PSA.82.1	He judges every judge and rules over every ruler, saying,
PSA.82.2	“How long will you judges refuse to listen
PSA.82.2	to the voice of true justice and continue to corrupt what is right
PSA.82.2	by judging in favor of the wrong?”
PSA.82.2	Pause in his presence
PSA.82.3	“Defend the defenseless, the fatherless and the forgotten,
PSA.82.3	the disenfranchised and the destitute.
PSA.82.4	Your duty is to deliver the poor and the powerless;
PSA.82.4	liberate them from the grasp of the wicked.
PSA.82.5	But you continue in your darkness and ignorance
PSA.82.5	while the foundations of society are shaken to the core!
PSA.82.6	Didn’t I commission you as judges, saying,
PSA.82.6	‘You are all like gods, since you judge on my behalf.
PSA.82.6	You are all like sons of the Most High, my representatives.’
PSA.82.7	Nevertheless, in death you are nothing but mere men!
PSA.82.7	You will be laid in the ground like any prince and you will die.”
PSA.82.8	All rise! For God now takes his place as judge of all the earth.
PSA.82.8	Don’t you know that everything and everyone belongs to him?
PSA.82.8	The nations will be sifted in his hands!
PSA.83.1	God, you have to do something! Don’t be silent and just sit idly by.
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	Can’t you see what they’re doing?
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	All your enemies are stirred up in an uproar!
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	They despise you, Lord.
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	In their defiant arrogance they rise up
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	to host their secret council against your people.
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	They conspire together to come and harm
PSA.83.2+PSA.83.3	your cherished ones—your hidden ones.
PSA.83.4	Our enemies keep saying,
PSA.83.4	“Now is the time to wipe Israel off the map.
PSA.83.4	We’ll destroy even the memory of her existence!”
PSA.83.5	They’ve made their pact, consulting and conspiring,
PSA.83.5	aligning together in their covenant against God.
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7+PSA.83.8	All the sons of Ishmael, the desert sheiks and the nomadic tribes, Amalekites, Canaanites, Moabites,
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7+PSA.83.8	and all the nations that surround us,
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7+PSA.83.8	Philistines, Phoenicians, Gadarenes, and Samaritans;
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7+PSA.83.8	allied together they’re ready to attack!
PSA.83.6+PSA.83.7+PSA.83.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.83.9	Do to them all what you did to the Midianites
PSA.83.9	who were defeated by Gideon.
PSA.83.9	Or what you did to Sisera and Jabin
PSA.83.9	when Deborah and Barak defeated them by the Kishon River.
PSA.83.10	Do to your enemies what you did at Endor,
PSA.83.10	whose rotting corpses fertilized the land.
PSA.83.11+PSA.83.12	Repeat history, God! Make all their “noble ones”
PSA.83.11+PSA.83.12	die like Oreb, Zebah, and Zalmunna, who said in their pride,
PSA.83.11+PSA.83.12	“We will seize God’s people along with all their pleasant lands!”
PSA.83.13	Blow them away, God, like straw in the wind,
PSA.83.13	like a tumbleweed in the wilderness!
PSA.83.14	Burn them up like a raging fire roaring down the mountainside;
PSA.83.14	consume them all until only charred sticks remain!
PSA.83.15	Chase them away like before a mighty storm and terrifying tempest.
PSA.83.16	O Lord, disgrace them until their faces fill with shame,
PSA.83.16	and make them acknowledge the glory of your name.
PSA.83.17	Make them utter failures in everything they do
PSA.83.17	until they perish in total disgrace and humiliation
PSA.83.18	so they will know that you, and you alone,
PSA.83.18	are Yahweh, the only Most High God exalted over all the earth!
PSA.84.1	God of Heaven’s Armies, you find so much beauty in your people!
PSA.84.1	They’re like lovely sanctuaries of your presence.
PSA.84.2	Deep within me are these lovesick longings,
PSA.84.2	desires and daydreams of living in union with you.
PSA.84.2	When I’m near you my heart and my soul
PSA.84.2	will sing and worship with my joyful songs of you,
PSA.84.2	my true source and spring of life!
PSA.84.3	O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, my King and my God,
PSA.84.3	even the sparrows and swallows are welcome to build a nest
PSA.84.3	among your altars for the birds to raise their young.
PSA.84.4	What pleasure fills those who live every day in your temple,
PSA.84.4	enjoying you as they worship in your presence!
PSA.84.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.84.5	How enriched are they who find their strength in the Lord;
PSA.84.5	within their hearts are the highways of holiness!
PSA.84.6	Even when their paths wind through the dark valley of tears,
PSA.84.6	they dig deep to find a pleasant pool 
PSA.84.6	He gives to them a brook of blessing
PSA.84.6	filled from the rain of an outpouring.
PSA.84.7	They grow stronger and stronger with every step forward,
PSA.84.7	and the God of all gods will appear before them in Zion.
PSA.84.8	Hear my cry, O God of Heaven’s Armies!
PSA.84.8	God of Jacob, listen to my loving prayer.
PSA.84.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.84.9	God, your wrap-around presence is our defense.
PSA.84.9	In your kindness look upon the faces of your anointed ones.
PSA.84.10	For just one day of intimacy with you is like
PSA.84.10	a thousand days of joy rolled into one!
PSA.84.10	I’d rather stand at the threshold in front of the Gate Beautiful,
PSA.84.10	ready to go in and worship my God,
PSA.84.10	than to live my life without you
PSA.84.10	in the most beautiful palace of the wicked.
PSA.84.11	For the Lord God is brighter than the brilliance of a sunrise!
PSA.84.11	Wrapping himself around me like a shield,
PSA.84.11	he is so generous with his gifts of grace and glory.
PSA.84.11	Those who walk along his paths with integrity
PSA.84.11	will never lack one thing they need, for he provides it all!
PSA.84.12	O Lord of Heaven’s Armies,
PSA.84.12	what euphoria fills those who forever trust in you!
PSA.85.1	Lord, your love has poured out
PSA.85.1	so many amazing blessings on our land!
PSA.85.1	You’ve restored Jacob’s destiny from captivity.
PSA.85.2	You’ve forgiven our many sins and covered
PSA.85.2	every one of them in your love.
PSA.85.2	Pause in his presence
PSA.85.3	So now it’s obvious that your blazing anger has ended and
PSA.85.3	the furious fire of wrath has been extinguished 
PSA.85.4	So bring us back to loving you, God our Savior.
PSA.85.4	Restore our hearts so that we’ll never again
PSA.85.4	feel your anger rise against us.
PSA.85.5	Will you forever hold a grudge?
PSA.85.5	Will your anger endure for all time?
PSA.85.6	Revive us again, O God! I know you will! Give us a fresh start!
PSA.85.6	Then all your people will taste your joy and gladness.
PSA.85.7	Pour out even more of your love on us!
PSA.85.7	Reveal more of your kindness and restore us back to you!
PSA.85.8	Now I’ll listen carefully for your voice
PSA.85.8	and wait to hear whatever you say.
PSA.85.8	Let me hear your promise of peace—
PSA.85.8	the message every one of your godly lovers longs to hear.
PSA.85.8	Don’t let us in our ignorance turn back from following you.
PSA.85.9	For I know your power and presence shines on all your lovers.
PSA.85.9	Your glory always hovers over all who bow low before you.
PSA.85.10	Your mercy and your truth have married each other.
PSA.85.10	Your righteousness and peace have kissed.
PSA.85.11	Flowers of your faithfulness are blooming on the earth.
PSA.85.11	Righteousness shines down from the sky.
PSA.85.12	Yes, the Lord keeps raining down blessing after blessing,
PSA.85.12	and prosperity will drench the land with a bountiful harvest.
PSA.85.13	For deliverance and peace are his forerunners,
PSA.85.13	preparing a path for his steps.
PSA.86.1	Lord, bend down to listen to my prayer.
PSA.86.1	I am in deep trouble. I’m broken and humbled,
PSA.86.1	and I desperately need your help.
PSA.86.2	Guard my life, for I’m your faithful friend, your loyal servant for life.
PSA.86.2	I turn to you in faith, my God, my hero; come and rescue me!
PSA.86.3	Lord God, hear my constant cry for help;
PSA.86.3	show me your favor and bring me to your fountain of grace!
PSA.86.4	Restore joy to your loving servant once again,
PSA.86.4	for all I am is yours, O God.
PSA.86.5	Lord, you are so good to me, so kind in every way
PSA.86.5	and ready to forgive,
PSA.86.5	for your grace-fountain keeps overflowing,
PSA.86.5	drenching all your lovers who pray to you.
PSA.86.6	God, won’t you pay attention to this urgent cry?
PSA.86.6	Lord, bend down to listen to my prayer.
PSA.86.7	Whenever trouble strikes, I will keep crying out to you,
PSA.86.7	for I know your help is on the way.
PSA.86.8	God, there’s no one like you;
PSA.86.8	there’s no other god as famous as you.
PSA.86.8	You outshine all others and your miracles make it easy to know you.
PSA.86.9	Lord Almighty, you are the one who created all the nations;
PSA.86.9	Look at them—they’re all on their way!
PSA.86.9	Yes, the day will come when they all will worship you
PSA.86.9	and put your glory on display.
PSA.86.10	You are the one and only God.
PSA.86.10	What miracles! What wonders! What greatness belongs to you!
PSA.86.11	Teach me more about you, how you work and how you move,
PSA.86.11	so that I can walk onward in your truth
PSA.86.11	until everything within me brings honor to your name.
PSA.86.12	With all my heart and passion I will thank you, my God!
PSA.86.12	I will give glory to your name, always and forever!
PSA.86.13	You love me so much and you placed your greatness upon me.
PSA.86.13	You rescued me from the deepest place of darkness,
PSA.86.13	and you have delivered me from a certain death.
PSA.86.14	God, look at how these arrogant ones have defied me.
PSA.86.14	Like a vicious band of violent men they have tried to kill me.
PSA.86.14	They wouldn’t worry for a moment that they were sinning against you!
PSA.86.15	But Lord, your nurturing love is tender and gentle.
PSA.86.15	You are slow to get angry yet so swift to show your faithful love.
PSA.86.15	You are full of abounding grace and truth.
PSA.86.16	Bring me to your grace-fountain
PSA.86.16	so that your strength becomes mine.
PSA.86.16	Be my hero and come rescue your servant once again!
PSA.86.17	Send me a miraculous sign to show me how much you love me,
PSA.86.17	so that those who hate me will see it and be ashamed.
PSA.86.17	Don’t they know that you, Lord, are my comforter,
PSA.86.17	the one who comes to help me?
PSA.87.1	High upon his hills of holiness stands God’s city.
PSA.87.2	How God loves the gates of Zion, his favorite place on earth.
PSA.87.3	So many glorious things have been proclaimed
PSA.87.3	over Zion, God’s holy city!
PSA.87.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.87.4	For the Lord says, “Here are the nations
PSA.87.4	who will acknowledge me as God:
PSA.87.4	Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, and the Mediterranean people,
PSA.87.4	even distant Ethiopia.
PSA.87.4	They will all boast, ‘I was born in Zion!’ ”
PSA.87.5	But over Zion it will be said,
PSA.87.5	“The mighty Man was born there and he will establish it.”
PSA.87.5	For the God Most High will truly bless Jerusalem.
PSA.87.6	And when he counts her citizens, recording them in his registry,
PSA.87.6	he will write by their name: “This one was born again here!”
PSA.87.6	Pause in his presence
PSA.87.7	And the princes of God’s feasts will sing and dance, singing,
PSA.87.7	“Every fountain of delight springs up from your life within me!”
PSA.88.1	Yahweh is the God who continually saves me.
PSA.88.1	I weep before you night and day.
PSA.88.2	Please bend down and listen to my sobbing,
PSA.88.2	for my life is riddled with troubles
PSA.88.2	and death is just around the corner!
PSA.88.3	Everyone sees my life ebbing out.
PSA.88.3	They consider me a hopeless case and see me as a dead man.
PSA.88.4	They’ve all left me here to die, helpless,
PSA.88.4	like one who is doomed for death.
PSA.88.5	They’re convinced you’ve forsaken me,
PSA.88.5	certain that you’ve forgotten me completely—
PSA.88.5	abandoned, pierced, with nothing to look forward to but death.
PSA.88.6	They have discarded me and thrown me down
PSA.88.6	into the deepest darkness as into a bottomless pit.
PSA.88.7	I feel your wrath and it’s a heavy weight upon me,
PSA.88.7	drowning me beneath a sea of sorrow.
PSA.88.7	Pause in his presence
PSA.88.8	Why did you turn all my friends against me?
PSA.88.8	You’ve made me like a cursed man in their eyes.
PSA.88.8	No one wants to be with me now.
PSA.88.8	You’ve caught me in a trap with no way out.
PSA.88.9	Every day I beg for your help. Can’t you see my tears?
PSA.88.9	My eyes are swollen with weeping.
PSA.88.9	My arms are wide, longing for mercy,
PSA.88.9	but you’re nowhere to be found.
PSA.88.10	How can those who are cut off from your care
PSA.88.10	even know that you are there?
PSA.88.10	How can I rise up to praise you if I’m dead and gone?
PSA.88.10	Pause in his presence
PSA.88.11	Who can give thanks for your love in the graveyard?
PSA.88.11	Who preaches your faithfulness in the place of destruction?
PSA.88.12	Does death’s darkness declare your miracles?
PSA.88.12	How can anyone who’s in the grave, where all is forgotten,
PSA.88.12	remember how you keep your promises?
PSA.88.13	Lord, you know my prayer before I even whisper it.
PSA.88.13	At each and every sunrise you will
PSA.88.13	continue to hear my cry until you answer.
PSA.88.14	O Lord, why have you thrown my life away?
PSA.88.14	Will you keep turning the other way every time I call out to you?
PSA.88.15	I’ve had to live in poverty and trouble all my life.
PSA.88.15	Now I’m humiliated, broken, and helpless before your terrors
PSA.88.15	and I can’t take it anymore.
PSA.88.16	I’m overwhelmed by your burning anger.
PSA.88.16	I’ve taken the worst you could give me
PSA.88.16	and I’m speechless before you.
PSA.88.17	I’m drowning beneath the waves of this sorrow,
PSA.88.17	cut off with no one to help.
PSA.88.18	All my loved ones and friends keep far away from me,
PSA.88.18	leaving me all alone with only darkness as my friend.
PSA.89.1	This forever-song I sing of the gentle love of God!
PSA.89.1	Young and old alike will hear about
PSA.89.1	your faithful, steadfast love—never failing!
PSA.89.2	Here’s my chorus: “Your mercy grows through the ages.
PSA.89.2	Your faithfulness is firm, rising up to the skies.”
PSA.89.3	I heard the Lord say, “My covenant has been made
PSA.89.3	and I’m committed forever to my chosen one, David.
PSA.89.4	I have made my oath that there will be sons of David forever,
PSA.89.4	sons that are kings through every generation.”
PSA.89.4	Pause in his presence
PSA.89.5+PSA.89.6	Can you hear it? Heaven is filled with your praises, O Lord!
PSA.89.5+PSA.89.6	All the holy ones are praising you for your miracles.
PSA.89.5+PSA.89.6	The sons of God are all praising you for your mighty wonders.
PSA.89.5+PSA.89.6	We could search the skies forever and never find one like you.
PSA.89.5+PSA.89.6	All the mighty angels could not be compared to you.
PSA.89.7	You are a God who is greatly to be feared
PSA.89.7	as you preside over the council of holy ones.
PSA.89.7	You are surrounded by trembling ones
PSA.89.7	who are overwhelmed with fear and dread,
PSA.89.7	stunned as they stand in awe of you!
PSA.89.8	So awesome are you, O Yahweh, Lord God of Angel Armies!
PSA.89.8	Where could we find anyone as glorious as you?
PSA.89.8	Your faithfulness shines all around you!
PSA.89.9	You rule over oceans and the swelling seas.
PSA.89.9	When their stormy waves rise, you speak, and they lie still.
PSA.89.10	You crushed the strongholds of Egypt
PSA.89.10	and all your enemies were scattered
PSA.89.10	at the mighty display of your glory-power.
PSA.89.11	All the heavens and everything on earth belong to you,
PSA.89.11	for you are the Creator of all that is seen and unseen.
PSA.89.12	The four corners of the earth were put in place by you.
PSA.89.12	You made the majestic mountains
PSA.89.12	that are still shouting their praises to your name.
PSA.89.13	Breathtaking and awesome is your power!
PSA.89.13	Astounding and unbelievable
PSA.89.13	is your might and strength when it goes on display!
PSA.89.14	Your glorious throne rests on a foundation
PSA.89.14	of righteousness and just verdicts.
PSA.89.14	Grace and truth are the attendants who go before you.
PSA.89.15	O Lord, how blessed are the people
PSA.89.15	who experience the shout of worship,
PSA.89.15	for they walk in the radiance of your presence.
PSA.89.16	We can do nothing but leap for joy all day long,
PSA.89.16	for we know who you are and what you do,
PSA.89.16	and you’ve exalted us on high.
PSA.89.17	The glory of your splendor is our strength,
PSA.89.17	and your marvelous favor makes us even stronger,
PSA.89.17	lifting us even higher!
PSA.89.18	You are our King, the holiest one of all;
PSA.89.18	your wrap-around presence is our protection.
PSA.89.19+PSA.89.20	You spoke to your prophets in visions, saying,
PSA.89.19+PSA.89.20	“I have found a mighty hero for my people.
PSA.89.19+PSA.89.20	I have chosen David as my loving servant and exalted him.
PSA.89.19+PSA.89.20	I have anointed him as king with the oil of my holiness.
PSA.89.21	I will be strength to him and I will give him
PSA.89.21	my grace to sustain him no matter what comes.
PSA.89.22	None of his enemies will get the best of him,
PSA.89.22	nor will the wicked one overpower him.
PSA.89.23	For I will crush his every adversary
PSA.89.23	and do away with all who hate him.
PSA.89.24	Because I love him and treasure him,
PSA.89.24	my faithfulness will always protect him.
PSA.89.24	I will place my great favor upon him,
PSA.89.24	and I will cause his power and fame to increase.
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand over the sea
PSA.89.25	and his right hand over the rivers.
PSA.89.26	And he will come before me, saying,
PSA.89.26	‘You truly are my Father, my only God, and my strong deliverer!’
PSA.89.27	I am setting him apart, favoring him as my firstborn son.
PSA.89.27	I will make him the most high king in all the earth!
PSA.89.28	I will love him forever and always show him kindness.
PSA.89.28	My covenant with him will never be broken.
PSA.89.29	For I have decreed that he will always have an heir—
PSA.89.29	a dynasty that will release the days of heaven on earth.
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31+PSA.89.32	But if his children turn from me and forsake my words,
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31+PSA.89.32	refusing to walk in my truth, renouncing and violating my laws,
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31+PSA.89.32	then I will surely punish them for their sins
PSA.89.30+PSA.89.31+PSA.89.32	with my stern discipline until they regret it.
PSA.89.33	But I will never, no never, lift my faithful love from off their lives.
PSA.89.33	My kindness will prevail and I will never disown them.
PSA.89.34+PSA.89.35	How could I revoke my covenant of love that I promised David?
PSA.89.34+PSA.89.35	For I have given him my word, my holy, irrevocable word.
PSA.89.34+PSA.89.35	How could I lie to my loving servant David?
PSA.89.36+PSA.89.37	Sons of David will continue to reign on his throne,
PSA.89.36+PSA.89.37	and their kingdom will endure as long as the sun is in the sky.
PSA.89.36+PSA.89.37	This covenant will be an unbreakable promise that
PSA.89.36+PSA.89.37	I have established for all time.”
PSA.89.36+PSA.89.37	Pause in his presence
PSA.89.38	Why have you rejected me, the one you anointed?
PSA.89.38	Why would you cast me away?
PSA.89.38	Why would you lose your temper with me?
PSA.89.39	You have torn up the contract you made with me, your servant.
PSA.89.39	You have stripped away my crown and thrown it to the ground.
PSA.89.40	You have torn down all my walls of defense
PSA.89.40	and have made my every hiding place into ruins.
PSA.89.41	All the passersby attack and rob me while my neighbors mock!
PSA.89.42	Instead of fighting for me, you took the side of my enemies,
PSA.89.42	even giving them strength to subdue me,
PSA.89.42	and then watched them celebrate their victory!
PSA.89.43	You are no longer helping me in battle.
PSA.89.43	You’ve forsaken me to the swords of those
PSA.89.43	who would strike me down.
PSA.89.44	You’ve made my regal splendor to decrease
PSA.89.44	and allowed my rule to be overthrown.
PSA.89.45	Because of you, I’ve become old before my time and
PSA.89.45	I’m publicly disgraced!
PSA.89.45	Pause in his presence
PSA.89.46	How long will you hide your love from me?
PSA.89.46	Have you left me for good?
PSA.89.46	How long will your anger continue to burn against me?
PSA.89.47	Remember, Lord, I am nothing but dust,
PSA.89.47	here today and so soon blown away.
PSA.89.47	Is this all you’ve created us for? For nothing but this?
PSA.89.48	Which one of us will live forever?
PSA.89.48	We are all mortal, terminal, for we will all one day die.
PSA.89.48	Which one of us would ever escape our appointment with death
PSA.89.48	and dodge our own funeral?
PSA.89.48	Pause in his presence
PSA.89.49	So God, where is all this love and kindness you promised us?
PSA.89.49	What happened to your covenant with David?
PSA.89.50	Have you forgotten how your own servants are being slandered?
PSA.89.50	Lord God, it seems like I’m carrying in my heart
PSA.89.50	all the pain and abuse of many people.
PSA.89.51	They have relentlessly insulted and persecuted us,
PSA.89.51	your anointed ones.
PSA.89.52	Nevertheless, blessed be our God forever and ever.
PSA.89.52	Amen. Faithful is our King!
PSA.90.1	Lord, you have always been our eternal home,
PSA.90.1	our hiding place from generation to generation.
PSA.90.2	Long before you gave birth to the earth
PSA.90.2	and before the mountains were born,
PSA.90.2	you have been from everlasting to everlasting,
PSA.90.2	the one and only true God.
PSA.90.3	When you speak the words “Life, return to me!”
PSA.90.3	man turns back to dust.
PSA.90.4	One thousand years pass before your eyes
PSA.90.4	like yesterday that quickly faded away,
PSA.90.4	like a night’s sleep soon forgotten.
PSA.90.5+PSA.90.6	One day we will each be swept away into the sleep of death.
PSA.90.5+PSA.90.6	We glide along through the tides of time—
PSA.90.5+PSA.90.6	so quickly gone, like a dream that fades at dawn.
PSA.90.5+PSA.90.6	Like glistening grass that springs up one day
PSA.90.5+PSA.90.6	and is dry and withered the next, ready to be cut down!
PSA.90.7	Terrified by your anger, confined beneath the curse,
PSA.90.7	we live our lives knowing your wrath.
PSA.90.8	For all of our faults and flaws are in full view to you.
PSA.90.8	Everything we want to hide, you search out
PSA.90.8	and expose by the radiance of your face.
PSA.90.9	We are banished to live in the shadow of your anger.
PSA.90.9	Our days soon become years until our lifetime comes to an end,
PSA.90.9	finished with nothing but a sigh.
PSA.90.10	You’ve limited our life span to a mere seventy years,
PSA.90.10	yet some you give grace to live still longer.
PSA.90.10	But even the best of years are marred by tears and toils,
PSA.90.10	and in the end with nothing more than a gravestone in a graveyard!
PSA.90.10	We’re gone so quickly, so swiftly;
PSA.90.10	we pass away and simply disappear.
PSA.90.11	Lord, who fully knows the power of your passion
PSA.90.11	and the intensity of your emotions?
PSA.90.12	Help us to remember that our days are numbered,
PSA.90.12	and help us to interpret our lives correctly.
PSA.90.12	Set your wisdom deeply in our hearts
PSA.90.12	so that we may accept your correction.
PSA.90.13	Return to us again, O God!
PSA.90.13	How much longer will it take until you show us
PSA.90.13	your abundant compassion?
PSA.90.14	Let the sunrise of your love end our dark night.
PSA.90.14	Break through our clouded dawn again!
PSA.90.14	Only you can satisfy our hearts,
PSA.90.14	filling us with songs of joy to the end of our days.
PSA.90.15	We’ve been overwhelmed with grief;
PSA.90.15	come now and overwhelm us with gladness.
PSA.90.15	Replace our years of trouble with decades of delight.
PSA.90.16	Let us see your miracles again, and let the rising generation
PSA.90.16	see the glorious wonders you’re famous for.
PSA.90.17	O Lord our God, let your sweet beauty rest upon us
PSA.90.17	and give us favor.
PSA.90.17	Come work with us, and then our works will endure,
PSA.90.17	and give us success in all we do.
PSA.91.1	When you sit enthroned under the shadow of Shaddai,
PSA.91.1	you are hidden in the strength of God Most High.
PSA.91.2	He’s the hope that holds me and the Stronghold to shelter me,
PSA.91.2	the only God for me, and my great confidence.
PSA.91.3	He will rescue you from every hidden trap of the enemy,
PSA.91.3	and he will protect you from false accusation
PSA.91.3	and any deadly curse.
PSA.91.4	His massive arms are wrapped around you, protecting you.
PSA.91.4	You can run under his covering of majesty and hide.
PSA.91.4	His arms of faithfulness are a shield keeping you from harm.
PSA.91.5	You will never worry about an attack of demonic forces at night
PSA.91.5	nor have to fear a spirit of darkness coming against you.
PSA.91.6	Don’t fear a thing!
PSA.91.6	Whether by night or by day, demonic danger will not trouble you,
PSA.91.6	nor will the powers of evil launched against you.
PSA.91.7	Even in a time of disaster, with thousands and thousands being killed,
PSA.91.7	you will remain unscathed and unharmed.
PSA.91.8	you will be a spectator as the wicked perish in judgment,
PSA.91.8	for they will be paid back for what they have done!
PSA.91.9+PSA.91.10	When we live our lives within the shadow of God Most High,
PSA.91.9+PSA.91.10	our secret hiding place, we will always be shielded from harm.
PSA.91.9+PSA.91.10	How then could evil prevail against us or disease infect us?
PSA.91.11	God sends angels with special orders to protect you wherever you go,
PSA.91.11	defending you from all harm.
PSA.91.12	If you walk into a trap, they’ll be there for you
PSA.91.12	and keep you from stumbling.
PSA.91.13	You’ll even walk unharmed among the fiercest powers of darkness,
PSA.91.13	trampling every one of them beneath your feet!
PSA.91.14	For here is what the Lord has spoken to me:
PSA.91.14	“Because you have delighted in me as my great lover,
PSA.91.14	I will greatly protect you.
PSA.91.14	I will set you in a high place, safe and secure before my face.
PSA.91.15	I will answer your cry for help every time you pray,
PSA.91.15	and you will find and feel my presence
PSA.91.15	even in your time of pressure and trouble.
PSA.91.15	I will be your glorious hero and give you a feast.
PSA.91.16	You will be satisfied with a full life and with all that I do for you.
PSA.91.16	For you will enjoy the fullness of my salvation!”
PSA.92.1	It’s so enjoyable to come before you
PSA.92.1	with uncontainable praises spilling from our hearts!
PSA.92.1	How we love to sing our praises over and over to you,
PSA.92.1	to the matchless God, high and exalted over all!
PSA.92.2	At each and every sunrise we will be thanking you
PSA.92.2	for your kindness and your love.
PSA.92.2	As the sun sets and all through the night,
PSA.92.2	we will keep proclaiming, “You are so faithful!”
PSA.92.3	Melodies of praise will fill the air as every musical instrument,
PSA.92.3	joined with every heart, overflows with worship.
PSA.92.4	No wonder I’m so glad; I can’t keep it in!
PSA.92.4	Lord, I’m shouting with glee over all you’ve done,
PSA.92.4	for all you’ve done for me!
PSA.92.5	What mighty miracles and your power at work, just to name a few.
PSA.92.5	Depths of purpose and layers of meaning
PSA.92.5	saturate everything you do.
PSA.92.6	Such amazing mysteries found within every miracle
PSA.92.6	that nearly everyone seems to miss.
PSA.92.6	Those with no discernment can never really discover
PSA.92.6	the deep and glorious secrets hidden in your ways.
PSA.92.7	It’s true the wicked flourish, but only for a moment,
PSA.92.7	foolishly forgetting their destiny with death,
PSA.92.7	that they will all one day be destroyed forevermore.
PSA.92.8	But you, O Lord, are exalted forever
PSA.92.8	in the highest place of endless glory,
PSA.92.9	while all your opponents, the workers of wickedness,
PSA.92.9	will all perish, forever separated from you.
PSA.92.10	Your anointing has made me strong and mighty.
PSA.92.10	by pouring fresh oil over me.
PSA.92.11	You’ve said that those lying in wait to pounce on me
PSA.92.11	would be defeated,
PSA.92.11	and now it’s happened right in front of my eyes
PSA.92.11	and I’ve heard their cries of surrender!
PSA.92.12	Yes! Look how you’ve made all your lovers
PSA.92.12	to flourish like palm trees,
PSA.92.12	each one growing in victory, standing with strength!
PSA.92.13	You’ve transplanted them into your heavenly courtyard,
PSA.92.13	where they are thriving before you.
PSA.92.14	For in your presence they will still overflow and be anointed.
PSA.92.14	Even in their old age they will stay fresh,
PSA.92.14	bearing luscious fruit and abiding faithfully.
PSA.92.15	Listen to them! With pleasure they still proclaim:
PSA.92.15	“You’re so good! You’re my beautiful strength!
PSA.92.15	You’ve never made a mistake with me.”
PSA.93.1	Look! Yahweh now reigns as King!
PSA.93.1	He has covered himself with majesty and strength,
PSA.93.1	wearing them as his splendor-garments.
PSA.93.1	Regal power surrounds him as he sits securely on his throne.
PSA.93.1	He’s in charge of it all, the entire world,
PSA.93.1	and he knows what he’s doing!
PSA.93.2	Lord, you have reigned as King from the very beginning of time.
PSA.93.2	Eternity is your home.
PSA.93.3+PSA.93.4	Chaos once challenged you.
PSA.93.3+PSA.93.4	The raging waves lifted themselves over and over,
PSA.93.3+PSA.93.4	high above the ocean’s depths, letting out their mighty roar!
PSA.93.3+PSA.93.4	Yet at the sound of your voice they were all stilled by your might.
PSA.93.3+PSA.93.4	What a majestic King, filled with power!
PSA.93.5	Nothing could ever change your royal decrees;
PSA.93.5	they will last forever!
PSA.93.5	Holiness is the beauty that fills your house;
PSA.93.5	you are the one who abides forevermore!
PSA.94.1	Lord God Almighty, you are the God
PSA.94.1	who takes vengeance on your enemies.
PSA.94.1	It’s time for you to punish evil!
PSA.94.1	Let your rays of revelation-light shine from your people and
PSA.94.1	pierce the conscience of the wicked and punish them.
PSA.94.2	It’s time to arise as judge of all the earth;
PSA.94.2	arise to punish the proud with the penalty they deserve!
PSA.94.3	How much longer will you sit back and watch the wicked
PSA.94.3	triumph in their evil, boasting in all that is wrong?
PSA.94.4+PSA.94.5	Listen to them bragging among themselves,
PSA.94.4+PSA.94.5	big in their own eyes, all because of the crimes
PSA.94.4+PSA.94.5	they’ve committed against your people!
PSA.94.4+PSA.94.5	See how they’re crushing those who love you, God,
PSA.94.4+PSA.94.5	cruelly oppressing those who belong to you.
PSA.94.6	Heartlessly they murder the widows, the foreigners,
PSA.94.6	and even the orphaned children.
PSA.94.7	They say to themselves, “The Lord God doesn’t see this.
PSA.94.7	Their God, the God of Jacob, he doesn’t even care!”
PSA.94.8	But you’d better watch out, you stupid fools!
PSA.94.8	You’d better wise up! Why would you act like God doesn’t exist?
PSA.94.8	Do you really think that God can’t hear their cries?
PSA.94.9	God isn’t hard of hearing; he’ll hear all their cries.
PSA.94.9	God isn’t blind. He who made the eye has superb vision
PSA.94.9	and he’s watching all you do.
PSA.94.10	Won’t the God who knows all things know what you’ve done?
PSA.94.10	The God who punishes nations will surely punish you!
PSA.94.11	The Lord has fully examined every thought of man
PSA.94.11	and found them all to be empty and futile.
PSA.94.12	Lord Yah, there’s such a blessing that comes
PSA.94.12	when you teach us your word and your ways.
PSA.94.12	Even the sting of your correction can be sweet.
PSA.94.13	It rescues us from our days of trouble
PSA.94.13	until you are ready to punish the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the Lord will never walk away from his cherished ones,
PSA.94.14	nor would he forsake his chosen ones who belong to him.
PSA.94.15	Whenever you pronounce judgments, they reveal righteousness.
PSA.94.15	All your lovers will be pleased.
PSA.94.16	Lord, who will protect me from these wicked ones?
PSA.94.16	If you don’t stand to defend me, who will? I have no one but you!
PSA.94.17	I would have been killed so many times
PSA.94.17	if you had not been there for me.
PSA.94.18	When I screamed out, “Lord, I’m doomed!”
PSA.94.18	your fiery love was stirred and you raced to my rescue.
PSA.94.19	Whenever my busy thoughts were out of control,
PSA.94.19	the soothing comfort of your presence
PSA.94.19	calmed me down and overwhelmed me with delight.
PSA.94.20	It’s obvious to all; you will have nothing to do
PSA.94.20	with corrupt rulers who pass laws that empower evil
PSA.94.20	and defeat what is right.
PSA.94.21	For they gang up against the lovers of righteousness
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22+PSA.94.23	But I know that all their evil plans will boomerang back onto them.
PSA.94.22+PSA.94.23	Every plot they hatch will simply seal their own doom.
PSA.94.22+PSA.94.23	For you, my God, you will destroy them,
PSA.94.22+PSA.94.23	giving them what they deserve.
PSA.94.22+PSA.94.23	For you are my true tower of strength,
PSA.94.22+PSA.94.23	my safe place, my hideout, and my true shelter.
PSA.95.1	Come on, everyone! Let’s sing for joy to the Lord!
PSA.95.1	Let’s shout our loudest praises to our God who saved us!
PSA.95.2	Everyone come meet his face with a thankful heart.
PSA.95.2	Don’t hold back your praises;
PSA.95.2	make him great by your shouts of joy!
PSA.95.3	For the Lord is the greatest of all,
PSA.95.3	King-God over all other gods!
PSA.95.4	In one hand he holds the mysteries of the earth
PSA.95.4	and in the other he holds the highest mountain peaks.
PSA.95.5	He’s the owner of every ocean,
PSA.95.5	the engineer and sculptor of earth itself!
PSA.95.6	Come and kneel before this Creator-God;
PSA.95.6	come and bow before the mighty God, our majestic maker!
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	For we are the lovers he cares for and he is the God we worship.
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	So drop everything else and listen to his voice!
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	For this is what he’s saying:
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	“Today, when I speak,
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	don’t even think about turning a deaf ear to me
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	like they did when they tested me at Meribah and Massah,
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	the place where they argued with me, their Creator.
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	Your ancestors challenged me over and over with their complaining,
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	even though I had convinced them of my power and love.
PSA.95.7+PSA.95.8+PSA.95.9	They still doubted my care for them.
PSA.95.10	So for forty long years I was grieved and disgusted by them.
PSA.95.10	I described them as wicked wanderers
PSA.95.10	whose hearts would not follow my ways or keep my words.
PSA.95.11	So I made a vow in my anger and declared,
PSA.95.11	‘They will never enter the resting place I’ve planned for them!’
PSA.95.11	”
PSA.96.1	Go ahead—sing your new song to the Lord!
PSA.96.1	Let everyone in every language sing him a new song.
PSA.96.2+PSA.96.3	Don’t stop! Keep on singing! Make his name famous!
PSA.96.2+PSA.96.3	Tell everyone every day how wonderful he is.
PSA.96.2+PSA.96.3	Give them the good news of our great Savior.
PSA.96.2+PSA.96.3	Take the message of his glory and miracles to every nation.
PSA.96.2+PSA.96.3	Tell them about all the amazing things he has done.
PSA.96.4	For the Lord’s greatness is beyond description
PSA.96.4	and he deserves all the praise that comes to him.
PSA.96.4	He is our King-God and it’s right to be in holy awe of him.
PSA.96.5	Other gods are absolutely worthless.
PSA.96.5	For the Lord God is Creator-God,
PSA.96.5	who spread the splendor of the skies!
PSA.96.6	Breathtaking brilliance and awe-inspiring majesty
PSA.96.6	radiate from his shining presence.
PSA.96.6	His stunning beauty overwhelms all who come before him.

PSA.96.10	for he treats everyone fair and square.
PSA.96.11+PSA.96.12	Let the skies sing for joy! Let the earth join in the chorus.
PSA.96.11+PSA.96.12	Let oceans thunder and fields echo this ecstatic praise
PSA.96.11+PSA.96.12	until every swaying tree of every forest joins in,
PSA.96.11+PSA.96.12	lifting up their songs of joyous praise to him!
PSA.96.13	For here he comes, the Lord God,
PSA.96.13	and he’s ready to judge the world.
PSA.96.13	He will do what’s right and can be trusted
PSA.96.13	to always do what’s fair.
PSA.97.1	Yahweh now reigns as King! Let everyone rejoice!
PSA.97.1	His rule extends everywhere, even to distant lands,
PSA.97.1	and the islands of the sea, let them all be glad.
PSA.97.2	Clouds both dark and mysterious now surround him.
PSA.97.2	His throne of glory rests upon
PSA.97.2	a foundation of righteousness and justice.
PSA.97.3	All around him burns a blazing glory-fire consuming all his foes.
PSA.97.4	When his lightning strikes, it lights up the world.
PSA.97.4	People are wide-eyed as they tremble and shake.

PSA.97.5	when the Lord of all the earth draws near.
PSA.97.6	Heaven’s messengers preach righteousness and
PSA.97.6	people everywhere see his glory in the sky!
PSA.97.7	Shame covers all who boast in other gods, for they worship idols.
PSA.97.7	For all the supernatural powers once worshiped
PSA.97.7	the true and living God.
PSA.97.8	But God’s Zion-people are content,
PSA.97.8	for they know and hear the truth.
PSA.97.8	The people of praise rejoice over all your judgments, O Lord!
PSA.97.9	For you are King-God, the Most High God over all the earth.
PSA.97.9	You are exalted above every supernatural power!
PSA.97.10	Listen, you lovers of God! Hate evil,
PSA.97.10	for God can keep you from wrong
PSA.97.10	and protect you from the power of wickedness.
PSA.97.11	For he sows seeds of light within his lovers,
PSA.97.11	and seeds of joy burst forth for the lovers of God!
PSA.97.12	So be glad and continue to give him thanks,
PSA.97.12	for God’s holiness is seen in everything he does.

PSA.98.7	until everyone everywhere shouts out in unison,
PSA.98.7	“Glory to the Lord!”
PSA.98.8	Let the rivers and streams clap with applause
PSA.98.8	as the mountains rise in a standing ovation
PSA.98.8	to join the mighty choir of exaltation.

PSA.99.4	He insists on being fair to all,
PSA.99.4	promoting true justice and righteousness in Jacob.
PSA.99.5	So everyone, exalt the Lord our God
PSA.99.5	facedown before his glory-throne, for he is great and holy.
PSA.99.6	,
PSA.99.6	like Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, who all interceded,
PSA.99.6	asking God for help.
PSA.99.6	God heard their cries and came to their rescue.
PSA.99.7	He spoke to them from the pillar of clouds
PSA.99.7	and they followed his instructions,
PSA.99.7	doing everything he told them.
PSA.99.8	God, the great forgiver, answered their prayers.
PSA.99.8	Yet he would punish them when they went astray.
PSA.99.9	Keep exalting the Lord our God
PSA.99.9	facedown before his glory-throne, for he is great and holy!
PSA.100.1	Lift up a great shout of joy to the Lord!
PSA.100.1	Go ahead and do it—everyone, everywhere!
PSA.100.2	As you serve him, be glad and worship him.
PSA.100.2	Sing your way into his presence with joy!
PSA.100.3	And realize what this really means—
PSA.100.3	we have the privilege of worshiping the Lord our God.
PSA.100.3	For he is our Creator and we belong to him.
PSA.100.3	We are the people of his pleasure.
PSA.100.4	You can pass through his open gates with the password of praise.
PSA.100.4	Come right into his presence with thanksgiving.
PSA.100.4	Come bring your thank offering to him
PSA.100.4	and affectionately bless his beautiful name!
PSA.100.5	For the Lord is always good and ready to receive you.
PSA.100.5	He’s so loving that it will amaze you—
PSA.100.5	so kind that it will astound you!
PSA.100.5	And he is famous for his faithfulness toward all.
PSA.100.5	Everyone knows our God can be trusted,
PSA.100.5	for he keeps his promises to every generation!
PSA.101.1	Lord, I will sing about your faithful love for me.
PSA.101.1	My song of praise will have your justice as its theme.
PSA.101.2	I’m trying my best to walk in the way of integrity,
PSA.101.2	especially in my own home.
PSA.101.2	But I need your help!
PSA.101.2	I’m wondering, Lord, when will you appear?
PSA.101.3	I refuse to gaze on that which is vulgar.
PSA.101.3	I despise works of evil people
PSA.101.3	and anything that moves my heart away from you.
PSA.101.3	I will not let evil hold me in its grip.
PSA.101.4	Every perverse and crooked way I have put away from my heart,
PSA.101.4	for I will have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness.
PSA.101.5	I will silence those who secretly want to slander my friends,
PSA.101.5	and I will not tolerate the proud and arrogant.
PSA.101.6	My innermost circle will only be those
PSA.101.6	whom I know are pure and godly.
PSA.101.6	They will be the only ones I allow to minister to me.
PSA.101.7	There’s no room in my home for hypocrites,
PSA.101.7	for I can’t stand chronic liars who flatter and deceive.
PSA.101.8	At each and every sunrise I will awake to do what’s right
PSA.101.8	and put to silence those who love wickedness,
PSA.101.8	freeing God’s people from their evil grip.
PSA.102.1	Lord, listen to my prayer! Listen to my cry for help!
PSA.102.2	You can’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress.
PSA.102.2	Stoop down to hear my prayer and answer me quickly, Lord!
PSA.102.3+PSA.102.4	For my days of happiness have gone up in smoke.
PSA.102.3+PSA.102.4	My body is raging with fever, my heart is sick,
PSA.102.3+PSA.102.4	and I’m consumed by this illness—
PSA.102.3+PSA.102.4	withered like a dead leaf. I can’t even eat.
PSA.102.5	I’m nothing but skin and bones.
PSA.102.5	Nothing’s left of me but whispered groans.
PSA.102.6	I’m depressed, lonely, forgotten, and abandoned.
PSA.102.7	I’m sleepless, shivering in the cold, forlorn and friendless,
PSA.102.7	like a lonely bird on the rooftop.
PSA.102.8	My every enemy mocks and insults me incessantly.
PSA.102.8	They even use my name as a curse to speak over others!
PSA.102.9+PSA.102.10	Because of your great and furious anger against me
PSA.102.9+PSA.102.10	all I do is suffer with sorrow,
PSA.102.9+PSA.102.10	with nothing to eat but a meal of mourning.
PSA.102.9+PSA.102.10	My crying fills my cup with salty tears!
PSA.102.9+PSA.102.10	In your wrath you have rejected me,
PSA.102.9+PSA.102.10	sweeping me away like dirt on the floor.
PSA.102.11	My days are marked by the lengthening shadows of death.
PSA.102.11	I’m withering away and there’s nothing left of me.
PSA.102.12	But then I remember that you, O Lord,
PSA.102.12	still sit enthroned as King over all!
PSA.102.12	The fame of your name will be revealed to every generation.
PSA.102.13	I know you are about to arise and show your tender love to Zion.
PSA.102.13	Now is the time, Lord,
PSA.102.13	for your compassion and mercy to be poured out—
PSA.102.13	the appointed time has come
PSA.102.14	For your servants weep in sympathy over Zion’s ruins
PSA.102.14	and feel love for her every stone.
PSA.102.15	When you arise to intervene,
PSA.102.15	all the nations and kings will be stunned
PSA.102.15	and will fear your awesome name, trembling before your glory!
PSA.102.16	Yes, you will reveal yourself to Zion
PSA.102.16	and appear in the brightness of your glory
PSA.102.16	to restore her and give her children.
PSA.102.17	He responds to the prayer of the poor and broken
PSA.102.17	and will not despise the cry of the homeless.
PSA.102.18	Write all this down for the coming generation,
PSA.102.18	so re-created people will read it and praise the Lord!
PSA.102.19	Tell them how Yah looked down from his high and holy place,
PSA.102.19	gazing from his glory to survey the earth.
PSA.102.20	He listened to all the groaning of his people longing to be free,
PSA.102.20	and he set loose the sons of death to experience life.
PSA.102.21	Multitudes will stream to Jerusalem to
PSA.102.21	praise the Lord and declare his name in Zion!
PSA.102.22	Peoples from every land, their kings and kingdoms,
PSA.102.22	will gather together to worship the Lord.
PSA.102.23	But God has brought me to my knees, shortening my life.
PSA.102.24	So I cry out to you, my God, Father of eternity,
PSA.102.24	please don’t let me die!
PSA.102.24	I know my life is not yet finished.
PSA.102.25	With your hands you once formed the foundations of the earth
PSA.102.25	and handcrafted the heavens above.
PSA.102.26+PSA.102.27	They will all fade away one day like worn-out clothing,
PSA.102.26+PSA.102.27	ready to be discarded, but you’ll still be here.
PSA.102.26+PSA.102.27	You will replace it all!
PSA.102.26+PSA.102.27	Your first creation will be changed,
PSA.102.26+PSA.102.27	but you alone will endure, the God of all eternity!
PSA.102.28	Generation after generation our descendants will live securely,
PSA.102.28	for you are the one protecting us, keeping us for yourself.
PSA.103.1	With my whole heart, with my whole life,
PSA.103.1	and with my innermost being,
PSA.103.1	I bow in wonder and love before you, the holy God!
PSA.103.2	Yahweh, you are my soul’s celebration.
PSA.103.2	How could I ever forget the miracles of kindness
PSA.103.2	you’ve done for me?
PSA.103.3	You kissed my heart with forgiveness, in spite of all I’ve done.
PSA.103.3	You’ve healed me inside and out from every disease.
PSA.103.4	You’ve rescued me from hell and saved my life.
PSA.103.4	You’ve crowned me with love and mercy.
PSA.103.5	You satisfy my every desire with good things.
PSA.103.5	You’ve supercharged my life so that I soar again
PSA.103.5	like a flying eagle in the sky!
PSA.103.6	You’re a God who makes things right,
PSA.103.6	giving justice to the defenseless.
PSA.103.7	You unveiled to Moses your plans
PSA.103.7	and showed Israel’s sons what you could do.
PSA.103.8	Lord, you’re so kind and tenderhearted
PSA.103.8	to those who don’t deserve it
PSA.103.8	and so patient with people who fail you!
PSA.103.8	Your love is like a flooding river
PSA.103.8	overflowing its banks with kindness.
PSA.103.9	You don’t look at us only to find our faults,
PSA.103.9	just so that you can hold a grudge against us.
PSA.103.10	You may discipline us for our many sins,
PSA.103.10	but never as much as we really deserve.
PSA.103.10	Nor do you get even with us for what we’ve done.
PSA.103.11	Higher than the highest heavens—
PSA.103.11	that’s how high your tender mercy extends!
PSA.103.11	Greater than the grandeur of heaven above
PSA.103.11	is the greatness of your loyal love, towering over all
PSA.103.11	who fear you and bow down before you!
PSA.103.12	Farther than from a sunrise to a sunset—
PSA.103.12	that’s how far you’ve removed our guilt from us.
PSA.103.13	The same way a loving father feels toward his children—
PSA.103.13	that’s but a sample of your tender feelings toward us,
PSA.103.13	your beloved children, who live in awe of you.
PSA.103.14	You know all about us, inside and out.
PSA.103.14	You are mindful that we’re made from dust.
PSA.103.15	Our days are so few, and our momentary beauty
PSA.103.15	so swiftly fades away!
PSA.103.16	Then all of a sudden we’re gone,
PSA.103.16	like grass clippings blown away in a gust of wind,
PSA.103.16	taken away to our appointment with death,
PSA.103.16	leaving nothing to show that we were here.
PSA.103.17	But Lord, your endless love stretches
PSA.103.17	from one eternity to the other,
PSA.103.17	unbroken and unrelenting toward those who fear you
PSA.103.17	and those who bow facedown in awe before you.
PSA.103.17	Your faithfulness to keep every gracious promise you’ve made
PSA.103.17	passes from parents, to children, to grandchildren, and beyond.
PSA.103.18	You are faithful to all those who follow your ways
PSA.103.18	and keep your word.
PSA.103.19	God’s heavenly throne is eternal, secure, and strong,
PSA.103.19	and his sovereignty rules the entire universe.
PSA.103.20	So bless the Lord, all his messengers of power,
PSA.103.20	for you are his mighty heroes who listen intently
PSA.103.20	to the voice of his word to do it.
PSA.103.21	Bless and praise the Lord, you mighty warriors,
PSA.103.21	ministers who serve him well and fulfill his desires.
PSA.103.22	I will bless and praise the Lord with my whole heart!
PSA.103.22	Let all his works throughout the earth,
PSA.103.22	wherever his dominion stretches,
PSA.103.22	let everything bless the Lord!
PSA.104.1	Everything I am will praise and bless the Lord!
PSA.104.1	O Lord, my God, your greatness takes my breath away,
PSA.104.1	overwhelming me by your majesty, beauty, and splendor!
PSA.104.2	You wrap yourself with a shimmering, glistening light.
PSA.104.2	You wear sunshine like a garment of glory.
PSA.104.2	You stretch out the starry skies like a tapestry.
PSA.104.3	You build your balconies with light beams
PSA.104.3	and ride as King in a chariot you made from clouds.
PSA.104.3	You fly upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.104.4	You make your messengers into winds of the Spirit
PSA.104.4	and all your ministers become flames of fire.
PSA.104.5	You, our Creator, formed the earth,
PSA.104.5	and you hold it all together so it will never fall apart.
PSA.104.6	You poured the ocean depths over the planet,
PSA.104.6	submerging mountains beneath.
PSA.104.7	Yet at the sound of your thunder-shout
PSA.104.7	the waters all fled away, filling the deep with seas.
PSA.104.8	The mountains rose and valleys sank
PSA.104.8	to the levels you decreed for them.
PSA.104.9	Then you set a boundary line for the seas
PSA.104.9	and commanded them not to trespass.
PSA.104.10	You sent springs cascading through the valleys,
PSA.104.10	flowing freely between the mountains and hills.
PSA.104.11	You provide drink for every living thing;
PSA.104.11	men and beasts have their thirst quenched because of you.
PSA.104.12	The birds build nests near the tranquil streams,
PSA.104.12	chirping their joyous songs from the branches above.
PSA.104.13	From your kindness you send the rain to water the mountains
PSA.104.13	from the upper rooms of your palace.
PSA.104.13	Your goodness brings forth fruit for all to enjoy.
PSA.104.14	Your compassion brings the earth’s harvest, feeding the hungry.
PSA.104.14	You cause the grass to grow for livestock,
PSA.104.14	along with the fruit, grains, and vegetables to feed mankind.
PSA.104.15	You provide sweet wine to gladden hearts.
PSA.104.15	You give us daily bread to sustain life,
PSA.104.15	giving us glowing health for our bodies.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the Lord drink until they’re satisfied.
PSA.104.16	Lebanon’s lofty trees stand tall right where you planted them.
PSA.104.17	Within their branches you provide for birds
PSA.104.17	a place to build their nests;
PSA.104.17	even herons find a home in the cypress trees.
PSA.104.18	You make the high mountains a home for wild goats
PSA.104.18	and the rocky crag where the rock badgers burrow.
PSA.104.19	You made the moon to mark the months
PSA.104.19	and the sun to measure the days.
PSA.104.20	You turn off the light and it becomes night,
PSA.104.20	and all the beasts of the forest come out to prowl.
PSA.104.21	The mighty lions roar for their dinner,
PSA.104.21	but it’s you, God, who feeds them all.
PSA.104.22	At sunrise they slink back to their dens
PSA.104.22	to crouch down in the shadows.
PSA.104.23	Then man goes out to his labor and toil,
PSA.104.23	working from dawn to dusk.
PSA.104.24	O Lord, what an amazing variety of all you have created!
PSA.104.24	Wild and wonderful is this world you have made,
PSA.104.24	while wisdom was there at your side.
PSA.104.24	This world is full of so many creatures, yet each belongs to you!
PSA.104.25	And then there is the sea! So vast! So wide and deep—
PSA.104.25	swarming with countless forms of sea life, both small and great.
PSA.104.26	Trading ships glide through the high seas.
PSA.104.26	And look! There are the massive whales
PSA.104.26	bounding upon the waves.
PSA.104.27	All the creatures wait expectantly for you
PSA.104.27	to give them their food as you determine.
PSA.104.28	You come near and they all gather around,
PSA.104.28	feasting from your open hands,
PSA.104.28	and each is satisfied from your abundant supply.
PSA.104.29	But if you were to withhold from them and turn away,
PSA.104.29	they all would panic.
PSA.104.29	And when you choose to take away their breath,
PSA.104.29	each one dies and returns to the dust.
PSA.104.30	When you release your Spirit-wind, life is created,
PSA.104.30	ready to replenish life upon the earth.
PSA.104.31	May God’s glorious splendor endure forever!
PSA.104.31	May the Lord take joy and pleasure in all that he has made.
PSA.104.32	For the earth’s overseer has the power to make it tremble;
PSA.104.32	just a touch of his finger and volcanoes erupt
PSA.104.32	as the earth shakes and melts.
PSA.104.33	I will sing my song to the Lord as long as I live!
PSA.104.33	Every day I will sing my praises to God.
PSA.104.34	May you be pleased with every sweet thought I have about you,
PSA.104.34	for you are the source of my joy and gladness.
PSA.104.35	Now, let all the sinners be swept from the earth.
PSA.104.35	But I will keep on praising you, my Lord, with all that is within me.
PSA.104.35	My joyous, blissful shouts of “Hallelujah” are all because of you!
PSA.105.1	Go ahead and give God thanks
PSA.105.1	for all the glorious things he has done!
PSA.105.1	Go ahead and worship him!
PSA.105.1	Tell everyone about his wonders!
PSA.105.2	Let’s sing his praises! Sing, and put all of his miracles to music!
PSA.105.3	Shine and make your joyful boast in him, you lovers of God.
PSA.105.3	Let’s be happy and keep rejoicing no matter what.
PSA.105.4	Seek more of his strength! Seek more of him!
PSA.105.4	Let’s always be seeking the light of his face.
PSA.105.5	Don’t you ever forget his miracles and marvels.
PSA.105.5	Hold to your heart every judgment he has decreed.
PSA.105.6	For you are his servants, the true seed of Abraham,
PSA.105.6	and you are the chosen ones, Jacob’s sons.
PSA.105.7	For he is the Lord our God,
PSA.105.7	and his wise authority can be seen in all he does.
PSA.105.8+PSA.105.9	For though a thousand generations may pass away,
PSA.105.8+PSA.105.9	he is still true to his word.
PSA.105.8+PSA.105.9	He has kept every promise he made to Abraham and to Isaac.
PSA.105.10	His promises have become an everlasting covenant to Jacob,
PSA.105.10	as a decree to Jacob.
PSA.105.11	He said to them, “I will give you all the land of Canaan
PSA.105.11	as your inheritance.”
PSA.105.12	They were very few in number
PSA.105.12	when God gave them that promise,
PSA.105.12	and they were all foreigners to that land.
PSA.105.13	They were wandering from one land to another
PSA.105.13	and from one kingdom to another.
PSA.105.14	Yet God would not permit anyone to touch them,
PSA.105.14	punishing even kings who came against them.
PSA.105.15	He said to them, “Don’t you dare lay a hand on my anointed ones,
PSA.105.15	and don’t do a thing to hurt my prophets!”
PSA.105.16	So God decreed a famine upon Canaan land,
PSA.105.16	cutting off their food supply.
PSA.105.17	But he had already sent a man ahead of his people to Egypt;
PSA.105.17	it was Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	His feet were bruised by strong shackles
PSA.105.18	and his soul was held by iron.
PSA.105.19	God’s promise to Joseph purged his character
PSA.105.19	until it was time for his dreams to come true.
PSA.105.20	Eventually, the king of Egypt sent for him, setting him free at last.
PSA.105.21	Then Joseph was put in charge of everything under the king;
PSA.105.21	he became the master of the palace
PSA.105.21	over all of the royal possessions.
PSA.105.22	Pharoah gave him authority over all the princes of the land,
PSA.105.22	and Joseph became the teacher of wisdom to the king’s advisors.
PSA.105.23	Then Jacob, with all of Joseph’s family,
PSA.105.23	came from Canaan to Egypt and settled in Goshen.
PSA.105.24	God made them very fruitful, and they multiplied incredibly
PSA.105.24	until they were greater in number than those who ruled them.
PSA.105.25	God turned their hearts to hate his people
PSA.105.25	and to deal treacherously with his servants.
PSA.105.26	But he sent them his faithful servant, Moses, the deliverer,
PSA.105.26	and chose Aaron to accompany him.
PSA.105.27	Their command brought down signs and wonders,
PSA.105.27	working miracles in Egypt.
PSA.105.28	By God’s direction, they spoke and released a plague
PSA.105.28	of thick darkness over the land.
PSA.105.29	God turned their rivers to blood, causing every fish to die.
PSA.105.30	And the judgment-plague of frogs came in enormous numbers,
PSA.105.30	swarming everywhere, even into Pharaoh’s bedroom!
PSA.105.31	God spoke and another plague was released—
PSA.105.31	massive swarms of flies, vast clouds of insects, covered the land.
PSA.105.32	God rained down hail and flaming fire upon Egypt.
PSA.105.33	Their gardens and vines were all destroyed,
PSA.105.33	shattering trees into splinters throughout the territory.
PSA.105.34	God spoke, and devouring hordes of locusts swept over the land,
PSA.105.35	picking the ground clean of vegetation and crops.
PSA.105.36	Then God struck down their firstborn sons,
PSA.105.36	the pride and joy of every Egyptian family.
PSA.105.37	At last, God freed all the Hebrews from their slavery
PSA.105.37	and sent them away laden with the silver and gold of Egypt.
PSA.105.37	And not even one was feeble on their way out!
PSA.105.38	Egypt was relieved at their exodus, ready to see them go,
PSA.105.38	for the terror of the Lord of the Hebrews had fallen upon them!
PSA.105.39	God spread out a cloud as shade as they moved ahead
PSA.105.39	and a cloud of fire to light up their night.
PSA.105.40	Moses prayed and God brought them quail to eat.
PSA.105.40	He satisfied them with heaven’s bread falling from the sky.
PSA.105.41	He broke open the boulder
PSA.105.41	and the waters poured out like a river in the desert.
PSA.105.42	For God could never forget
PSA.105.42	his holy promise to his servant Abraham.
PSA.105.43	So God brought out his chosen ones with singing;
PSA.105.43	with a joyful shout they were set free!
PSA.105.44	He gave them lands and nations, just like he promised.
PSA.105.44	Fruitful lands of crops they had never planted were now theirs.
PSA.105.45	All this was done for them so that they would be faithful
PSA.105.45	to keep the ways of God, obeying his laws and following his truths.
PSA.105.45	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.106.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.106.1	Everyone thank God, for he is good and easy to please.
PSA.106.1	Your tender love for us, Lord, continues on forever.
PSA.106.2	Who could ever fully describe your glorious miracles?
PSA.106.2	Yahweh, who could ever praise you enough?
PSA.106.3	The happiest one on earth is the one who keeps your word
PSA.106.3	and clings to righteousness every moment.
PSA.106.4	So remember me, Lord, as you take joy in your people.
PSA.106.4	And when you come to bring the blessings of salvation,
PSA.106.4	don’t forget me!
PSA.106.5	Let me share in the wealth and beauty of all your lovers,
PSA.106.5	rejoice with your nation in all their joys,
PSA.106.5	and let me share in the glory you give to your chosen ones.
PSA.106.6	We have all sinned so much, just like our fathers.
PSA.106.6	“Guilty” is written over our lives.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers who were delivered from Egypt
PSA.106.7	didn’t fully understand your wonders,
PSA.106.7	and they took you for granted.
PSA.106.7	Over and over you showed them such tender love and mercy!
PSA.106.7	Yet they were barely beyond the Red Sea
PSA.106.7	when they rebelled against you.
PSA.106.8	Nonetheless, you saved them more than once
PSA.106.8	so they would know how powerful you are,
PSA.106.8	showing them the honor of your name.
PSA.106.9	You roared over the waters of the Red Sea,
PSA.106.9	making a dry path for your people to cross through.
PSA.106.10	You freed them from the strong power
PSA.106.10	of those who oppressed them
PSA.106.10	and rescued them from bondage.
PSA.106.11	Then the waters rushed over their enemies and drowned them all—
PSA.106.11	not one survived.
PSA.106.12	Seeing this, the people believed your words,
PSA.106.12	and they all broke out with songs of praise!
PSA.106.13	Yet how quickly they forgot your miracles of power.
PSA.106.13	They wouldn’t wait for you to act when they were hungry,
PSA.106.14	but demanded you satisfy their cravings and give them food!
PSA.106.14	They tested you to the breaking point.
PSA.106.15	So you gave them what they wanted to eat,
PSA.106.15	but their souls starved away to nothing.
PSA.106.16	They became envious of Moses and Aaron, your holy ones.
PSA.106.17	You split open the earth and it swallowed up
PSA.106.17	Dathan and Abiram along with their followers.
PSA.106.18	Fire fell from heaven and burnt up all the band of rebels,
PSA.106.18	turning them to ashes.
PSA.106.19	They made an idol of a calf at Sinai
PSA.106.19	and bowed to worship their man-made statue.
PSA.106.20	They preferred the image of a grass-eating ox
PSA.106.20	to the presence of the glory-filled God.
PSA.106.21+PSA.106.22	They totally forgot it was you who saved them
PSA.106.21+PSA.106.22	by the wonders and awesome miracles you worked in Egypt.
PSA.106.23	So you were fed up and decided to destroy them.
PSA.106.23	But Moses, your chosen leader,
PSA.106.23	stood in the gap between you and the people
PSA.106.23	and made intercession on their behalf
PSA.106.23	to turn away your wrath from killing them all.
PSA.106.24	Yet they still didn’t believe your words
PSA.106.24	and they despised the land of delight you gave to them.
PSA.106.25	They grumbled and found fault with everything
PSA.106.25	and closed their hearts to your voice.
PSA.106.26	So you gave up and swore to them
PSA.106.26	that they would all die in the desert.
PSA.106.27	And you scattered their children to distant lands to die as exiles.
PSA.106.28	Then our fathers joined the worshipers
PSA.106.28	of the false god named “Lord of the Pit.”
PSA.106.28	They even ate the sacrifices offered to the dead!
PSA.106.29	All they did made you burn with anger.
PSA.106.29	It made you so angry that a plague broke out among them!
PSA.106.30	It continued until Phineas intervened and executed
PSA.106.30	the guilty for causing judgment to fall upon them.
PSA.106.31	Because of this deed of righteousness
PSA.106.31	Phineas will be remembered forever.
PSA.106.32	Your people also provoked you to wrath
PSA.106.32	at the stream called Strife.
PSA.106.32	This is where Moses got into serious trouble!
PSA.106.33	Because the people were rebellious against you,
PSA.106.33	Moses exploded in anger and spoke to them out of his bitterness.
PSA.106.34	Neither did our fathers destroy the enemies in the land,
PSA.106.34	as you had commanded them.
PSA.106.35	But they mingled themselves with their enemies
PSA.106.35	and learned to copy their works of darkness.
PSA.106.36	They began to serve their gods and bow before their idols.
PSA.106.36	All of this led them away from you
PSA.106.36	and brought about their downfall.
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their little children to the demon spirits,
PSA.106.38+PSA.106.39	shedding the innocent blood of their sons and daughters.
PSA.106.38+PSA.106.39	These dark practices greatly defiled the land and their own souls,
PSA.106.38+PSA.106.39	through the murder and bloodshed of their own babies!
PSA.106.38+PSA.106.39	Their sins made them spiritual adulterers before you.
PSA.106.40	This is why you were furious.
PSA.106.40	As your anger burned hot against them,
PSA.106.40	you couldn’t even stand to look
PSA.106.40	at your very own people any longer!
PSA.106.41	So you turned them over to the crushing hands of other nations,
PSA.106.41	and those who hated them became tyrants over them.
PSA.106.42	Oppressive enemies subdued them,
PSA.106.42	ruling over them with their tyranny.
PSA.106.43	Many times you would have come to rescue them,
PSA.106.43	but they continued in their rebellious ways,
PSA.106.43	choosing to ignore your warnings.
PSA.106.43	Then they sank lower and lower, destroyed by their depravity.
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	Yet even so, you waited and waited,
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	watching to see if they would turn
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	and cry out to you for 
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	And then, when you heard their cry,
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	you relented and you remembered your covenant
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	and you turned your heart toward them again,
PSA.106.44+PSA.106.45	according to your abundant, overflowing, and limitless love.
PSA.106.46	Then you caused even their oppressors
PSA.106.46	to pity them and show them compassion.
PSA.106.47	Do it again, Lord! Save us, O Lord, our God!
PSA.106.47	Gather us from our exile and unite us together
PSA.106.47	so that we will give our great and joyous thanks to you again
PSA.106.47	and bring you glory by our praises.
PSA.106.48	Blessed be our Lord God forever and ever.
PSA.106.48	And let everyone everywhere say, “Hallelujah!”
PSA.106.48	Amen! Faithful is our King!
PSA.107.1	Let everyone give all their praise and thanks to the Lord!
PSA.107.1	Here’s why—he’s better than anyone could ever imagine.
PSA.107.1	Yes, he’s always loving and kind, and his faithful love never ends.
PSA.107.2+PSA.107.3	So, go ahead—let everyone know it!
PSA.107.2+PSA.107.3	Tell the world how he broke through
PSA.107.2+PSA.107.3	and delivered you from the power of darkness and
PSA.107.2+PSA.107.3	has gathered us together from all over the world.
PSA.107.2+PSA.107.3	He has set us free to be his very own!
PSA.107.4	Some of us once wandered in the wilderness like desert nomads,
PSA.107.4	with no true direction or dwelling place.
PSA.107.5	Starving, thirsting, staggering,
PSA.107.5	we became desperate and filled with despair.
PSA.107.6	Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!
PSA.107.7	He led us right into a place of safety and abundance,
PSA.107.7	a suitable city to dwell in.
PSA.107.8	So lift your hands and thank God for his marvelous kindness
PSA.107.8	and for all his miracles of mercy for those he loves.
PSA.107.9	How he satisfies the souls of thirsty ones
PSA.107.9	and fills the hungry with all that is good!
PSA.107.10	Some of us once sat in darkness,
PSA.107.10	living in the dark shadows of death.
PSA.107.10	We were prisoners to our pain, chained to our regrets.
PSA.107.11	For we rebelled against God’s word
PSA.107.11	and rejected the wise counsel of God Most High.
PSA.107.12	So he humbled us through our circumstances,
PSA.107.12	watching us as we stumbled, with no one there to pick us back up.
PSA.107.12	Our own pain became our punishment.
PSA.107.13	Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!
PSA.107.14	His light broke through the darkness and
PSA.107.14	he led us out in freedom from death’s dark shadow
PSA.107.14	and snapped every one of our chains.
PSA.107.15	So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness
PSA.107.15	and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!
PSA.107.16	For he smashed through heavy prison doors and
PSA.107.16	shattered the steel bars that held us back, just to set us free!
PSA.107.17	Some of us were such fools, bringing on ourselves
PSA.107.17	sorrow and suffering all because of our sins.
PSA.107.18	Sick and feeble, unable to stand the sight of food,
PSA.107.18	we drew near to the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!
PSA.107.20	God spoke the words “Be healed,” and we were healed,
PSA.107.20	delivered from death’s door!
PSA.107.21	So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness
PSA.107.21	and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!
PSA.107.22	Bring your praise as an offering and your thanks as a sacrifice
PSA.107.22	as you sing your story of miracles with a joyful song.
PSA.107.23	Some of us set sail upon the sea to faraway ports,
PSA.107.23	transporting our goods from ship to shore.
PSA.107.24	We were witnesses of God’s power out in the ocean deep;
PSA.107.24	we saw breathtaking wonders upon the high seas.
PSA.107.25	When God spoke he stirred up a storm,
PSA.107.25	lifting high the waves with hurricane winds.
PSA.107.26+PSA.107.27	Ships were tossed by swelling sea, rising to the sky,
PSA.107.26+PSA.107.27	then dropping down to the depths,
PSA.107.26+PSA.107.27	reeling like drunkards, spinning like tops,
PSA.107.26+PSA.107.27	everyone at their wits’ end until even sailors despaired of life, cringing in terror.
PSA.107.28	Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!
PSA.107.29	God stilled the storm, calmed the waves,
PSA.107.29	and he hushed the hurricane winds to only a whisper.
PSA.107.30	We were so relieved, so glad as he guided us
PSA.107.30	safely to harbor in a quiet haven.
PSA.107.31	So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness
PSA.107.31	and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!
PSA.107.32	Let’s exalt him on high and lift up our praises in public;
PSA.107.32	let all the people and the leaders of the nation know
PSA.107.32	how great and wonderful is Yahweh, our God!
PSA.107.33	Whenever he chooses he can dry up a river
PSA.107.33	and turn the land into a desert.
PSA.107.34	Or he can take a fruitful land and make it into a saltwater swamp,
PSA.107.34	all because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
PSA.107.35	But he also can turn a barren wilderness into an oasis with water!
PSA.107.35	He can make springs flow into desert lands
PSA.107.36	and turn them into fertile valleys so that cities spring up,
PSA.107.36	and he gives it all to those who are hungry.
PSA.107.37	They can plant their fields and vineyards there
PSA.107.37	and reap a bumper crop and gather a fruitful harvest.
PSA.107.38	God will bless them and cause them to multiply and prosper.
PSA.107.39	But others will become poor,
PSA.107.39	humbled because of their oppression, tyranny, and sorrows.
PSA.107.40	For God pours contempt upon their arrogant abuse of power,
PSA.107.40	heaping scorn upon their princes,
PSA.107.40	and makes them wander among ruins.
PSA.107.41	But he raises up the poor and lowly with his favor,
PSA.107.41	giving them a safe place to live where no one can touch them.
PSA.107.41	God will grant them a large family and bless them!
PSA.107.42	The lovers of God will rejoice when they see this.
PSA.107.42	Good men are glad when the evil ones are silenced.
PSA.107.43	If you are truly wise, you’ll learn from what I’ve told you.
PSA.107.43	It’s time for you to consider these profound lessons
PSA.107.43	of God’s great love and mercy!
PSA.108.1	My heart, O God, is quiet and confident, all because of you.
PSA.108.1	Now I can sing my song with passionate praises!
PSA.108.1	Awake, O my soul, with the music of his splendor.
PSA.108.2	Arise, my soul, and sing his praises!
PSA.108.2	I will awaken the dawn with my worship,
PSA.108.2	greeting the daybreak with my songs 
PSA.108.3	Wherever I go I will thank you.
PSA.108.3	All the nations will hear my praise songs to you.
PSA.108.4	Your love is so extravagant, it reaches higher than the heavens!
PSA.108.4	Your faithfulness is so astonishing, it stretches to the skies!
PSA.108.5	Lord God, be exalted as you soar throughout the heavens.
PSA.108.5	May your shining glory be seen high above all the earth!
PSA.108.6	Come to your beloved ones and gently draw us out.
PSA.108.6	Answer our prayer for your saving help.
PSA.108.6	Come with your might and strength, 
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	Then I heard the Lord speak in his holy splendor,
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	and from his sanctuary I heard the Lord promise:
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	“In my triumph I will be the one to measure out
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	the portion of my inheritance to my people,
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	and I will secure the land as I promised you.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	Shechem, Succoth, Gilead, Manasseh;
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	they are all still mine!” he says.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	“Judah will continue to produce kings and lawgivers,
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	and Ephraim will produce great warriors.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	Moab will become my lowly servant.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	Edom will likewise serve my purposes.
PSA.108.7+PSA.108.8+PSA.108.9	I will lift up a shout of victory over the land of Philistia!
PSA.108.10	But who will bring my triumph into Edom’s fortresses?”
PSA.108.11	Lord, have you really rejected us, refusing to fight our battles?
PSA.108.12	Give us a Father’s help when we face our enemies.
PSA.108.12	For to trust in any man is an empty hope.
PSA.108.13	With God’s help we will prevail with might and power.
PSA.108.13	And with God’s help we’ll trample down our every foe!
PSA.109.1	God of all my praise, don’t stand silently by, aloof to my pain,
PSA.109.2	while the wicked slander me with their lies.
PSA.109.2	Even right in front of my face they lie through their teeth.
PSA.109.3	I’ve done nothing to them, but they still surround me
PSA.109.3	with their venomous words of hatred and vitriol.
PSA.109.4	Though I love them, they stand accusing me like Satan
PSA.109.4	for what I’ve never done.
PSA.109.4	I will pray until I become prayer itself.
PSA.109.5	They continually repay me with evil when I show them good.
PSA.109.5	They give me hatred when I show them love.
PSA.109.6+PSA.109.7	Show him how it feels! Let accusing liars be raised up against him,
PSA.109.6+PSA.109.7	like Satan himself standing right next to him.
PSA.109.6+PSA.109.7	And let him be declared guilty by a wicked judge.
PSA.109.6+PSA.109.7	May even his prayers be seen as sinful!
PSA.109.8	Shorten his life and let another replace him!
PSA.109.9	Make his wife a widow and his children orphans!
PSA.109.10	Let them wander as beggars in the street,
PSA.109.10	like homeless vagabonds, evicted from their ruins!
PSA.109.11	Let the creditors seize his entire estate,
PSA.109.11	and strangers, like vultures, take all that’s left!
PSA.109.12	Let no one be kind to him by showing pity to his fatherless children!
PSA.109.13	May all his posterity die with him! Cut down his family tree!
PSA.109.14+PSA.109.15	And may all the sins of his ancestors be recorded,
PSA.109.14+PSA.109.15	remembered before you, forever!
PSA.109.14+PSA.109.15	Cut off even the memory of his family from the face of the earth
PSA.109.16	because he never once showed love or kindness to others,
PSA.109.16	but persecuted the poor, the brokenhearted, and afflicted ones,
PSA.109.16	even putting them to death!
PSA.109.17	Since he enjoyed cursing them,
PSA.109.17	may all his curses now come raining back on him
PSA.109.17	until it all overwhelms him with misfortune!
PSA.109.17	Since he refused to bless others,
PSA.109.17	God, withhold every single blessing from him!
PSA.109.18	Bitterness, such vile vindictiveness, was upon everything he did.
PSA.109.18	Cursing was his lifestyle.
PSA.109.19+PSA.109.20	So smother him now with his own curses as his just reward.
PSA.109.19+PSA.109.20	This will be the Lord’s punishment upon him and
PSA.109.19+PSA.109.20	all my lying accusers who speak evil against me.
PSA.109.21	But now, O Yahweh-God, make yourself real to me
PSA.109.21	like you promised me you would.
PSA.109.21	Because of your constant love and your heart-melting kindness, come be my hero and deliver me!
PSA.109.22	I’m so broken, needy and hurting.
PSA.109.22	My heart is pierced through and I’m so wounded.
PSA.109.23	I’m slipping down a dark slope, shaken to the core, and helpless.
PSA.109.24	All my fasting has left me so weak I can hardly stand.
PSA.109.24	Now I’m shriveled up, nothing but skin and bones.
PSA.109.25	I’m the example of failure and shame to all who see me.
PSA.109.25	They just walk by me, shaking their heads.
PSA.109.26	You have to help me, O Lord God!
PSA.109.26	My true hero, come to my rescue and save me,
PSA.109.26	for you are loving and kind.
PSA.109.27	Then everyone will know that you have won my victory,
PSA.109.27	and they will all say to the Lord, “You have finished it!”
PSA.109.28	So let them curse me if they want,
PSA.109.28	but I know you will bless me!
PSA.109.28	All their efforts to destroy me will fail,
PSA.109.28	but I will succeed and be glad.
PSA.109.29	So let my Satan-like accusers fail!
PSA.109.29	Make them look ridiculous if they try to come against me.
PSA.109.29	Clothe them with a robe of guilty shame from this day on!
PSA.109.30	But I will give my thanks to you over and over
PSA.109.30	and everyone will hear my lavish praises.
PSA.109.31	For you stand right next to the broken ones
PSA.109.31	as their saving hero to rescue them from all their accusers!
PSA.110.1	Yahweh said to my Lord, the Messiah:
PSA.110.1	“Sit with me as enthroned ruler
PSA.110.1	while I subdue your every enemy.
PSA.110.1	They will bow low before you
PSA.110.1	as I make them a footstool for your feet.”
PSA.110.2	Messiah, I know God himself will establish your kingdom
PSA.110.2	as you reign in Zion-glory.
PSA.110.2	For he says to you, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!”
PSA.110.3	Your people will be your love offerings.
PSA.110.3	In the day of your mighty power you will be exalted,
PSA.110.3	and in the brightness of your holy ones you will shine
PSA.110.3	as an army arising from the womb of the dawn,
PSA.110.3	anointed with the dew of your youth!
PSA.110.4	Yahweh has taken a solemn oath
PSA.110.4	and will never back away from it, saying,
PSA.110.4	“You are a priest for eternity, my King of righteousness!”
PSA.110.5	The Lord stands in full authority to shatter to pieces
PSA.110.5	the kings who stand against you
PSA.110.5	on the day he displays his terrible wrath.
PSA.110.6	He will judge every rebellious nation,
PSA.110.6	filling their battlefield with corpses,
PSA.110.6	and will shatter the strongholds of ruling powers.
PSA.110.7	Yet he himself will drink from his inheritance
PSA.110.7	as from a flowing brook;
PSA.110.7	refreshed by love he will stand victorious!
PSA.111.1	Shout hallelujah to Yahweh!
PSA.111.1	May every one of his lovers hear my passionate praise to him,
PSA.111.1	even among the council of the holy ones.
PSA.111.2	For God’s mighty miracles astound me!
PSA.111.2	His wonders are so delightfully mysterious
PSA.111.2	that they leave all who seek them astonished.
PSA.111.3	Everything he does is full of splendor and beauty!
PSA.111.3	Each miracle demonstrates his eternal perfection.
PSA.111.4	His unforgettable works of surpassing wonder
PSA.111.4	reveal his grace and tender mercy.
PSA.111.5	He satisfies all who love and trust him,
PSA.111.5	and he keeps every promise he makes.
PSA.111.6	He reveals mighty power and marvels to his people
PSA.111.6	by handing them nations as a gift.
PSA.111.7	All God accomplishes is flawless, faithful, and fair,
PSA.111.7	and his every word proves trustworthy and true.
PSA.111.8	They are steadfast forever and ever,
PSA.111.8	formed from truth and righteousness.
PSA.111.9	His forever-love paid a full ransom for his people
PSA.111.9	so that now we’re free to come before Jehovah
PSA.111.9	to worship his holy and awesome name!
PSA.111.10	Where can wisdom be found? It is born in the fear of God.
PSA.111.10	Everyone who follows his ways
PSA.111.10	will never lack his living-understanding.
PSA.111.10	And the adoration of God will abide throughout eternity!
PSA.112.1	Shout in celebration of praise to the Lord!
PSA.112.1	Everyone who loves the Lord and delights in him
PSA.112.1	will cherish his words and be blessed beyond expectation.
PSA.112.2	Their descendants will be prosperous and influential.
PSA.112.2	Every generation of his godly lovers will experience his favor.
PSA.112.3	Great blessing and wealth fills the house 
PSA.112.3	for their integrity endures forever.
PSA.112.4	Even if darkness overtakes them,
PSA.112.4	sunrise-brilliance will come bursting through
PSA.112.4	because they are gracious to others, so tender and true.
PSA.112.5	Life is good for the one who is generous and charitable,
PSA.112.5	conducting affairs with honesty and truth.
PSA.112.6	Their circumstances will never shake them
PSA.112.6	and others will never forget their example.
PSA.112.7	They will not live in fear or dread of what may come,
PSA.112.7	for their hearts are firm, ever secure in their faith.
PSA.112.8	Steady and strong, they will not be afraid,
PSA.112.8	but will calmly face their every foe
PSA.112.8	until they all go down in defeat.
PSA.112.9	Never stingy and always generous to those in need,
PSA.112.9	their lives of influence and honor will never be forgotten,
PSA.112.9	for they were full of good deeds.
PSA.112.10	But the wicked take one look at a life lived like this
PSA.112.10	and they grit their teeth in anger, not understanding their bliss.
PSA.112.10	The wicked slink away speechless in the darkness that falls,
PSA.112.10	where hope dies and all their dreams fade away to nothing,
PSA.112.10	nothing at all!
PSA.113.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.113.1	Go ahead, praise the Lord, all you loving servants of God!
PSA.113.1	Keep it up! Praise him some more!
PSA.113.2	For the glorious name of the Lord is blessed forever and ever.
PSA.113.3	From sunrise brilliance to sunset beauty,
PSA.113.3	lift up his praise from dawn to dusk!
PSA.113.4	For he rules on high over the nations
PSA.113.4	with a glory that outshines even the heavens.
PSA.113.5	No one can be compared to God, enthroned on high!
PSA.113.6	He stoops down to look upon the sky and the earth.
PSA.113.7	He promotes the poor, picking them up from the dirt,
PSA.113.7	and rescues the needy from the garbage dump.
PSA.113.8	He turns paupers into princes and seats them
PSA.113.8	on their royal thrones of honor.
PSA.113.9	God’s grace provides for the barren ones a joyful home with children
PSA.113.9	so that even childless couples find a family.
PSA.113.9	He makes them happy parents surrounded by their pride and joy.
PSA.113.9	That’s the God we praise, so give it all to him!
PSA.114.1	Many years ago the Jewish people escaped Egypt’s tyranny,
PSA.114.2	so that Israel, God’s people of praise,
PSA.114.2	would become his holy sanctuary,
PSA.114.2	his kingdom on the earth.
PSA.114.3	The Red Sea waters saw them coming and ran the other way!
PSA.114.3	Then later, the Jordan River too
PSA.114.3	moved aside so that they could all pass through.
PSA.114.4	The land shuddered with fear.
PSA.114.4	Mountains and hills shook with dread.
PSA.114.5	O sea, what happened to you to make you flee?
PSA.114.5	O Jordan, what was it that made you turn and run?
PSA.114.6	O mountains, what frightened you so?
PSA.114.6	And you hills, what made you shiver?
PSA.114.7	Tremble, O earth, for you are in the presence of the Lord,
PSA.114.7	the God of Jacob.
PSA.114.8	He splits open boulders and brings up bubbling water.
PSA.114.8	Gushing streams burst forth 
PSA.115.1	God, glorify your name!
PSA.115.1	Yes, your name alone be glorified, not ours.
PSA.115.1	For you are the one who loves us passionately,
PSA.115.1	and you are faithful and true.
PSA.115.2	Why should the unbelievers mock us, saying,
PSA.115.2	“Where is this God of yours?”
PSA.115.3	But we know our God rules from the heavens
PSA.115.3	and he takes delight in all that he does.
PSA.115.4	The unbelievers worship what they make—
PSA.115.4	their wealth and their work.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	They idolize what they own
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	and what they make with their hands,
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	but their things can’t talk to them or answer their prayers.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	Their possessions will never satisfy.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	Their futile faith in dead idols and dead works
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	can never bring life or meaning to their souls.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	Blind men can only create blind things.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	Those deaf to God can only make a deaf image.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	Dead men can only create dead idols.
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	And everyone who trusts in these powerless, dead things
PSA.115.5+PSA.115.6+PSA.115.7+PSA.115.8	will be just like what they worship—powerless and dead.
PSA.115.9	So trust in the Lord, all his people.
PSA.115.9	For he is the only true hero,
PSA.115.9	the wrap-around God who is our shield!
PSA.115.10	You, his priests, trust in the Lord.
PSA.115.10	For he is the only true hero,
PSA.115.10	God-wrapped-around-us as our shield.
PSA.115.11	Yes, all his lovers who bow before him, trust in the Lord.
PSA.115.11	For he is our only true hero,
PSA.115.11	God-wrapped-around-us as our shield.
PSA.115.12	The Lord will never forget us in our need; he will bless us indeed!
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Israel;
PSA.115.12	he will bless the house of Aaron, his priest.
PSA.115.13	Yes! He will bless his lovers who bow before him,
PSA.115.13	no matter who they are.
PSA.115.14+PSA.115.15	God himself will fill you with more.
PSA.115.14+PSA.115.15	Blessings upon blessings will be heaped upon you
PSA.115.14+PSA.115.15	and upon your children from the maker of heaven and earth,
PSA.115.14+PSA.115.15	the very God who made you!
PSA.115.16	The heavens belong to our God; they are his alone,
PSA.115.16	but he has given us the earth and put us in charge.
PSA.115.17+PSA.115.18	Dead people cannot praise the Lord, but we can!
PSA.115.17+PSA.115.18	Those who sink to the silence of the grave
PSA.115.17+PSA.115.18	can no longer give glory to God, but we can!
PSA.115.17+PSA.115.18	So let’s praise the Lord!
PSA.115.17+PSA.115.18	Let’s begin now and let it go on until eternity is done.
PSA.115.17+PSA.115.18	Hallelujah, and praise the Lord!
PSA.116.1	I am passionately in love with God because he listens to me.
PSA.116.1	He hears my prayers and answers them.
PSA.116.2	As long as I live I’ll keep praying to him,
PSA.116.2	for he stoops down to listen to my heart’s cry.
PSA.116.3	Death once stared me in the face,
PSA.116.3	and I was close to slipping into its dark shadows.
PSA.116.3	I was terrified and overcome with sorrow.
PSA.116.4	I cried out to the Lord, “God, come and save me!”
PSA.116.5	He was so kind, so gracious to me.
PSA.116.5	Because of his passion toward me,
PSA.116.5	he made everything right and he restored me.
PSA.116.6	So I’ve learned from my experience
PSA.116.6	that God protects the childlike and humble ones.
PSA.116.6	For I was broken and brought low,
PSA.116.6	but he answered me and came to my rescue!
PSA.116.7	Now I can say to myself and to all,
PSA.116.7	“Relax and rest, be confident and serene,
PSA.116.7	for the Lord rewards fully those who simply trust in him.”
PSA.116.8	God has rescued my soul from death’s fear
PSA.116.8	and dried my eyes of many tears.
PSA.116.8	He’s kept my feet firmly on his path
PSA.116.9	and strengthened me so that I may please him
PSA.116.9	and live my life before him in his life-giving light.
PSA.116.10+PSA.116.11	Even when it seems I’m surrounded
PSA.116.10+PSA.116.11	by many liars and my own fears,
PSA.116.10+PSA.116.11	and though I’m hurting in my suffering and trauma,
PSA.116.10+PSA.116.11	I still stay faithful to God and speak words of faith.
PSA.116.12	So now, what can I ever give back to God
PSA.116.12	to repay him for the blessings he’s poured out on me?
PSA.116.13	I will lift up his cup of salvation and praise him extravagantly
PSA.116.13	for all that he’s done for me.
PSA.116.14	I will fulfill the promise I made to God
PSA.116.14	in the presence of his gathered people.
PSA.116.15	When one of God’s holy lovers dies,
PSA.116.15	it is costly to the Lord, touching his heart.
PSA.116.16	Lord, because I am your loving servant,
PSA.116.16	you have broken open my life and freed me from my chains.
PSA.116.17	Now I’ll worship you passionately and bring to you
PSA.116.17	my sacrifice of praise, drenched with thanksgiving!
PSA.116.18	I’ll keep my promise to you, God,
PSA.116.18	in the presence of your gathered people, just like I said I would.
PSA.116.19	I will worship you here in your living presence,
PSA.116.19	in the temple in Jerusalem.
PSA.116.19	I will worship and sing hallelujah, for I praise you, Lord!
PSA.117.1	Let everyone everywhere shine with praise to Yahweh!
PSA.117.1	Let it all out! Go ahead and praise him!
PSA.117.2	For he has conquered us with his great love
PSA.117.2	and his kindness has melted our hearts.
PSA.117.2	His faithfulness lasts forever and he will never fail you.
PSA.117.2	So go ahead, let it all out!
PSA.117.2	Praise Yah!
PSA.117.2	O Yah!
PSA.118.1	Keep on giving your thanks to God, for he is so good!
PSA.118.1	His constant, tender love lasts forever!
PSA.118.2	Let all his princely people sing,
PSA.118.2	“His constant, tender love lasts forever!”
PSA.118.3	Let all his holy priests sing,
PSA.118.3	“His constant, tender love lasts forever!”
PSA.118.4	Let all his lovers who bow low before him sing,
PSA.118.4	“His constant, tender love lasts forever!”
PSA.118.5	Out of my deep anguish and pain I prayed,
PSA.118.5	and God, you helped me as a father.
PSA.118.5	You came to my rescue and broke open the way
PSA.118.5	into a beautiful and broad place.
PSA.118.6	Now I know, Lord, that you are for me,
PSA.118.6	and I will never fear what man can do to me.
PSA.118.7	For you stand beside me as my hero who rescues me.
PSA.118.7	I’ve seen with my own eyes the defeat of my enemies.
PSA.118.7	I’ve triumphed over them all!
PSA.118.8	Lord, it is so much better to trust in you to save me
PSA.118.8	than to put my confidence in someone else.
PSA.118.9	Yes, it is so much better to trust in the Lord to save me
PSA.118.9	than to put my confidence in celebrities.
PSA.118.10	Once I was hemmed in and surrounded by those
PSA.118.10	who don’t love you.
PSA.118.10	But by Yahweh’s supernatural power I overcame them all!
PSA.118.11+PSA.118.12	Yes, they surrounded me,
PSA.118.11+PSA.118.12	like a swarm of killer bees swirling around me.
PSA.118.11+PSA.118.12	I was trapped like one trapped by a raging fire;
PSA.118.11+PSA.118.12	I was surrounded with no way out and at the point of collapse.
PSA.118.11+PSA.118.12	But by Yahweh’s supernatural power, I overcame them all!
PSA.118.13	They pushed me right up to the edge, and I was ready to fall,
PSA.118.13	but you helped me to triumph, and together we overcame them all.
PSA.118.14	Lord, you are my true strength and my glory-song,
PSA.118.14	my champion, my Savior!
PSA.118.15	The joyful songs I now sing will be sung again
PSA.118.15	in the hearts and homes of all your lovers.
PSA.118.15	My loud shouts of victory will echo throughout the land.
PSA.118.15	For Yahweh’s right hand conquers valiantly!
PSA.118.16	The right hand of Yahweh exalts!
PSA.118.16	The right hand of Yahweh will never fail.
PSA.118.17	You will not let them kill me,
PSA.118.17	but I will live to tell the world what the Lord has done for me.
PSA.118.18	Yes, the Lord punished me as I deserved,
PSA.118.18	but he’ll never give me over to death.
PSA.118.19	Swing wide, you gates of righteousness, and let me pass through,
PSA.118.19	and I will enter into your presence to worship only you.
PSA.118.20	I have found the gateway to God,
PSA.118.20	the pathway to his presence for all his lovers.
PSA.118.21	I will offer all my loving praise to you,
PSA.118.21	and I thank you so much for answering my prayer
PSA.118.21	and bringing me salvation!
PSA.118.22	The very stone the masons rejected as flawed
PSA.118.22	has turned out to be the most important capstone of the arch,
PSA.118.22	holding up the very house of God.
PSA.118.23	The Lord himself is the one who has done this,
PSA.118.23	and it’s so amazing, so marvelous to see!
PSA.118.24	This is the very day of the Lord that brings
PSA.118.24	gladness and joy, filling our hearts with glee.
PSA.118.25	O God, please come and save us again;
PSA.118.25	bring us your breakthrough-victory!
PSA.118.26	Blessed is this one who comes to us, the sent one of the Lord.
PSA.118.26	And from within the temple we cry, “We bless you!”
PSA.118.27+PSA.118.28	For the Lord our God has brought us his glory-light.
PSA.118.27+PSA.118.28	I offer him my life in joyous sacrifice.
PSA.118.27+PSA.118.28	Tied tightly to your altar I will bring you praise.
PSA.118.27+PSA.118.28	For you are the God of my life and I lift you high,
PSA.118.27+PSA.118.28	exalting you to the highest place.
PSA.118.29	So let’s keep on giving our thanks to God, for he is so good!
PSA.118.29	His constant, tender love lasts forever!
PSA.119.1	You’re only truly happy when you walk in total integrity,
PSA.119.1	walking in the light of God’s word.
PSA.119.2	What joy overwhelms everyone who keeps the ways of God,
PSA.119.2	those who seek him as their heart’s passion!
PSA.119.3	They’ll never do what’s wrong
PSA.119.3	but will always choose the paths of the Lord.
PSA.119.4	God has prescribed the right way to live:
PSA.119.4	obeying his laws with all our hearts.
PSA.119.5	How I long for my life to bring you glory
PSA.119.5	as I follow each and every one of your holy precepts!
PSA.119.6	Then I’ll never be ashamed,
PSA.119.6	for I take strength from all your commandments.
PSA.119.7	I will give my thanks to you from a heart of love and truth.
PSA.119.7	And every time I learn more of your righteous judgments,
PSA.119.8	I will be faithful to all that your word reveals—
PSA.119.8	so don’t ever give up on me!
PSA.119.9	How can a young man stay pure?
PSA.119.9	Only by living in the word of God and walking in its truth.
PSA.119.10	I have longed for you with the passion of my heart;
PSA.119.10	don’t let me stray from your directions!
PSA.119.11	I consider your prophecies to be my greatest treasure,
PSA.119.11	and I memorize them and write them on my heart
PSA.119.11	to keep me from committing sin’s treason against you.
PSA.119.12	My wonderful God, you are to be praised above all;
PSA.119.12	teach me the power of your decrees!
PSA.119.13	I speak continually of your laws
PSA.119.13	as I recite out loud your counsel to me.
PSA.119.14	I find more joy in following what you tell me to do
PSA.119.14	than in chasing after all the wealth of the world.
PSA.119.15	I set my heart on your precepts
PSA.119.15	and pay close attention to all your ways.
PSA.119.16	My delight is found in all your laws,
PSA.119.16	and I won’t forget to walk in your words.
PSA.119.17	Let me, your servant, walk in abundance of life
PSA.119.17	that I may always live to obey your truth.
PSA.119.18	Open my eyes to see the miracle-wonders hidden in your word.
PSA.119.19	My life on earth is so brief, so tutor me in the ways of your wisdom.
PSA.119.20	I am continually consumed by these irresistible longings,
PSA.119.20	these cravings to obey your every commandment!
PSA.119.21	Your displeasure rests with those who are arrogant,
PSA.119.21	who think they know everything;
PSA.119.21	you rebuke the rebellious who refuse your laws.
PSA.119.22	Don’t let them mock and scorn me for obeying you.
PSA.119.23	For even if the princes and my leaders choose to criticize me,
PSA.119.23	I will continue to serve you and walk in your plans for my life.
PSA.119.24	Your commandments are my counselors;
PSA.119.24	your word is my light and delight!
PSA.119.25	Lord, I’m fading away. I’m discouraged and lying in the dust;
PSA.119.25	revive me by your word, just like you promised you would.
PSA.119.26	I’ve poured out my life before you,
PSA.119.26	and you’ve always been there for me.
PSA.119.26	So now I ask: teach me more of your holy decrees.
PSA.119.27	Open up my understanding to the ways of your wisdom
PSA.119.27	and I will meditate deeply on your splendor and your wonders.
PSA.119.28	My life’s strength melts away with grief and sadness;
PSA.119.28	come strengthen me and encourage me with your words.
PSA.119.29	Keep me far away from what is false;
PSA.119.29	give me grace to stay true to your laws.
PSA.119.30	I’ve chosen to obey your truth
PSA.119.30	and walk in the splendor-light of all that you teach me.
PSA.119.31	Lord, don’t allow me to make a mess of my life,
PSA.119.31	for I cling to your commands and follow them as closely as I can.
PSA.119.32	I will run after you with delight in my heart,
PSA.119.32	for you will make me obedient to your instructions.
PSA.119.33	Give me revelation about the meaning of your ways
PSA.119.33	so I can enjoy the reward of following them fully.
PSA.119.34	Give me an understanding heart so that I can
PSA.119.34	passionately know and obey your truth.
PSA.119.35	Guide me into the paths that please you,
PSA.119.35	for I take delight in all that you say.
PSA.119.36	Cause my heart to bow before your words of wisdom
PSA.119.36	and not to the wealth of this world.
PSA.119.37	Help me turn my eyes away from illusions
PSA.119.37	so that I pursue only that which is true;
PSA.119.37	drench my soul with life as I walk in your paths.
PSA.119.38	Reassure me of your promises, for I am your beloved,
PSA.119.38	your servant who bows before you.
PSA.119.39	Defend me from the criticism I face
PSA.119.39	for keeping your beautiful words.
PSA.119.40	See how I long with cravings for more of your ways?
PSA.119.40	Let your righteousness revive my spirit!
PSA.119.41	May your tender love overwhelm me, O Lord,
PSA.119.41	for you are my Savior and you keep your promises.
PSA.119.42	I’ll always have an answer for those who mock me
PSA.119.42	because I trust in your word.
PSA.119.43	May I never forget your truth, for I rely upon your precepts.
PSA.119.44	I will observe your laws every moment of the day
PSA.119.44	and will never forget the words you say.
PSA.119.45	I will walk with you in complete freedom,
PSA.119.45	for I seek to follow your every command.
PSA.119.46	When I stand before kings, I will tell them the truth
PSA.119.46	and will never be ashamed.
PSA.119.47	My passion and delight is in your word,
PSA.119.47	for I love what you say to me!
PSA.119.48	I long for more revelation of your truth,
PSA.119.48	for I love the light of your word as I meditate on your decrees.
PSA.119.49	Lord, never forget the promises you’ve made to me,
PSA.119.49	for they are my hope and confidence.
PSA.119.50	In all of my affliction I find great comfort in your promises,
PSA.119.50	for they have kept me alive!
PSA.119.51	No matter how bitterly the proud mockers speak against me,
PSA.119.51	I refuse to budge from your precepts.
PSA.119.52	Your revelation-light is eternal;
PSA.119.52	I’m encouraged every time I think about your truth!
PSA.119.53	Whenever I see the wicked breaking your laws, I feel horrible.
PSA.119.54	As I journey through life, I put all your statutes to music;
PSA.119.54	they become the theme of my joyous songs.
PSA.119.55	Throughout the night I think of you, dear God;
PSA.119.55	I treasure your every word to me.
PSA.119.56	All this joy is mine as I follow your ways!
PSA.119.57	You are my satisfaction, Lord, and all that I need,
PSA.119.57	so I’m determined to do everything you say.
PSA.119.58	With all my heart I seek your favor;
PSA.119.58	pour out your grace on me as you promised!
PSA.119.59	When I realize that I’m going astray,
PSA.119.59	I turn back to obey your instructions.
PSA.119.60	I give my all to follow your revelation-light; I will not delay to obey.
PSA.119.61	Even when temptations encircle me with evil,
PSA.119.61	I won’t forget for a moment to follow your commands.
PSA.119.62	In the middle of the night I awake to give thanks to you
PSA.119.62	because of all your revelation-light; so right and true!
PSA.119.63	Anyone who loves you and bows in obedience to your words
PSA.119.63	will be my friend.
PSA.119.64	Give me more revelation of your ways,
PSA.119.64	for I see your love and tender care everywhere.
PSA.119.65	Your extravagant kindness to me
PSA.119.65	makes me want to follow your words even more!
PSA.119.66	Teach me how to make good decisions,
PSA.119.66	and give me revelation-light, for I believe in your commands.
PSA.119.67	Before I was humbled I used to always wander astray,
PSA.119.67	but now I see the wisdom of your words.
PSA.119.68	Everything you do is beautiful, flowing from your goodness;
PSA.119.68	teach me the power of your wonderful words!
PSA.119.69	Proud boasters make up lies about me
PSA.119.69	because I am passionate to follow all that you say.
PSA.119.70	Their hearts are dull and void of feelings,
PSA.119.70	but I find my true treasure in your truth.
PSA.119.71	The punishment you brought me through was the best thing
PSA.119.71	that could have happened to me, for it taught me your ways.
PSA.119.72	The words you speak to me are worth more
PSA.119.72	than all the riches and wealth in the whole world!
PSA.119.73	Your very hands have held me and made me who I am;
PSA.119.73	give me more revelation-light so I may learn to please you more.
PSA.119.74	May all your lovers see how you treat me and be glad,
PSA.119.74	for your words are entwined within my heart.
PSA.119.75	Lord, I know that your judgments are always right.
PSA.119.75	Even when it’s me you judge, you’re still faithful and true.
PSA.119.76	Send your kind mercy-kiss to comfort me, your servant,
PSA.119.76	just like you promised you would.
PSA.119.77	Love me tenderly so I can go on,
PSA.119.77	for I delight in your life-giving truth.
PSA.119.78	Shame upon the proud liars! See how they oppress me,
PSA.119.78	all because of my passion for your precepts!
PSA.119.79	May all your lovers follow me
PSA.119.79	as I follow the path of your instruction.
PSA.119.80	Make me passionate and wholehearted to fulfill your every wish,
PSA.119.80	so that I’ll never have to be ashamed of myself.
PSA.119.81	I’m lovesick with yearnings for more of your salvation,
PSA.119.81	for my heart is entwined with your word.
PSA.119.82	I’m consumed with longings for your promises,
PSA.119.82	so I ask, “When will they all come true?”
PSA.119.83	My soul feels dry and shriveled, useless and forgotten,
PSA.119.83	but I will never forget your living truth.
PSA.119.84	How much longer must I wait until you punish my persecutors?
PSA.119.84	For I am your loving servant.
PSA.119.85	Arrogant men who hate your truth and never obey your laws
PSA.119.85	have laid a trap for my life.
PSA.119.86	They don’t know that everything you say is true,
PSA.119.86	so they harass me with their lies. Help me, Lord!
PSA.119.87	They’ve nearly destroyed my life, but I refuse to yield;
PSA.119.87	I still live according to your word.
PSA.119.88	Revive me with your tender love and
PSA.119.88	spare my life by your kindness, and I will continue to obey you.
PSA.119.89	Standing firm in the heavens and fastened to eternity
PSA.119.89	is the word of God.
PSA.119.90	Your faithfulness flows from one generation to the next;
PSA.119.90	all that you created sits firmly in place to testify of you.
PSA.119.91	By your decree everything stands at attention,
PSA.119.91	for all that you have made serves you.
PSA.119.92	Because your words are my deepest delight,
PSA.119.92	I didn’t give up when all else was lost.
PSA.119.93	I can never forget the profound revelations you’ve taught me,
PSA.119.93	for they have kept me alive more than once.
PSA.119.94	Lord, I’m all yours, and you are my Savior;
PSA.119.94	I have sought to live my life pleasing to you.
PSA.119.95	Even though evil men wait in ambush to kill me,
PSA.119.95	I will set my heart before you to understand more of your ways.
PSA.119.96	I’ve learned that there is nothing perfect
PSA.119.96	in this imperfect world except your words,
PSA.119.96	for they bring such fantastic freedom into my life!
PSA.119.97	O how I love and treasure the revelation of your word;
PSA.119.97	throughout the day I fill my heart with its light!
PSA.119.98	By considering your commands I have an edge over my enemies,
PSA.119.98	for I take seriously everything you say.
PSA.119.99	You have given me more understanding than those who teach me,
PSA.119.99	for I’ve absorbed your eye-opening revelation.
PSA.119.100	You have graced me with more insight than the old sages
PSA.119.100	because I have not failed to walk in the light of your ways.
PSA.119.101	I refused to bend my morals when temptation was before me
PSA.119.101	so that I could become obedient to your word.
PSA.119.102	I refuse to turn away from difficult truths,
PSA.119.102	for you yourself have taught me to love your words.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are your living promises to me;
PSA.119.103	sweeter than honey is your revelation-light.
PSA.119.104	For your truth is the source of my understanding,
PSA.119.104	not the falsehoods of those who don’t know you, which I despise.
PSA.119.105	Truth’s shining light guides me in my choices and decisions;
PSA.119.105	the revelation of your word makes my pathway clear.
PSA.119.106	To live my life by your righteous rules
PSA.119.106	has been my holy and lifelong commitment.
PSA.119.107	I’m bruised and broken, overwhelmed by it all;
PSA.119.107	breathe life into me again by your living word.
PSA.119.108	Lord, receive my grateful thanks
PSA.119.108	and teach me more of how to please you.
PSA.119.109	Even though my life hangs in the balance,
PSA.119.109	I’ll keep following what you’ve taught me, no matter what.
PSA.119.110	The ungodly have done their best to throw me off track,
PSA.119.110	but I’ll not deviate from what you’ve told me to do.
PSA.119.111	Everything you speak to me is like joyous treasure,
PSA.119.111	filling my life with gladness.
PSA.119.112	I have determined in my heart to obey whatever you say,
PSA.119.112	fully and forever!
PSA.119.113	I despise those who can’t keep commitments,
PSA.119.113	for I passionately love your revelation-light!
PSA.119.114	You’re my place of quiet retreat, and your wrap-around presence
PSA.119.114	becomes my shield as I wrap myself in your word!
PSA.119.115	Go away! Leave me, all you workers of wickedness,
PSA.119.115	for you can’t stop me from following every command of my God.
PSA.119.116	Lord, strengthen my inner being by the promises of your word
PSA.119.116	so that I may live faithful and unashamed for you.
PSA.119.117	Lift me up and I will be safe.
PSA.119.117	Empower me to live every moment in the light of your ways.
PSA.119.118	Lord, you reject those who reject your laws,
PSA.119.118	for they fool no one but themselves!
PSA.119.119	The wicked are thrown away, discarded and valueless.
PSA.119.119	That’s why I will keep loving all of your laws!
PSA.119.120	My body trembles in holy awe of you, leaving me speechless,
PSA.119.120	for I’m frightened of your righteous judgments.
PSA.119.121	Don’t leave me to the mercies of those who hate me,
PSA.119.121	for I live to do what is just and fair.
PSA.119.122	Let me hear your promise of blessing over my life,
PSA.119.122	breaking me free from the proud oppressors.
PSA.119.123	As a lovesick lover, I yearn for more of your salvation
PSA.119.123	and for your virtuous promises.
PSA.119.124	Let me feel your tender love, for I am yours.
PSA.119.124	Give me more understanding of your wonderful ways.
PSA.119.125	I need more revelation from your word
PSA.119.125	to know more about you, for I’m in love with you!
PSA.119.126	Lord, the time has come for you to break through,
PSA.119.126	for evil men keep breaking your laws.
PSA.119.127	Truly, your message of truth means more to me
PSA.119.127	than a vault filled with the purest gold.
PSA.119.128	Every word you speak, every truth revealed, is always right
PSA.119.128	and beautiful to me, for I hate what is phony or false.
PSA.119.129	Your marvelous words are living miracles;
PSA.119.129	no wonder I long to obey everything you say.
PSA.119.130	Break open your word within me until revelation-light shines out!
PSA.119.130	Those with open hearts are given insight into your plans.
PSA.119.131	I open my mouth and inhale the word of God
PSA.119.131	because I crave the revelation of your commands.
PSA.119.132	Turn your heart to me, Lord, and show me your grace
PSA.119.132	like you do to every one of your godly lovers.
PSA.119.133	Prepare before me a path filled with your promises,
PSA.119.133	and don’t allow even one sin to have dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	Rescue me from the oppression of ungodly men
PSA.119.134	so that I can keep all your precepts.
PSA.119.135	Smile on me, your loving servant.
PSA.119.135	Instruct me on what is right in your eyes.
PSA.119.136	When I witness the rebellious breaking your laws,
PSA.119.136	it makes me weep uncontrollably!
PSA.119.137	Lord, your judgments reveal your righteousness,
PSA.119.137	and your verdicts are always fair.
PSA.119.138	The motive behind your every word is pure,
PSA.119.138	and your teachings are remarkably faithful and true.
PSA.119.139	I’ve been consumed with a furious passion to do what’s right,
PSA.119.139	all because of the way my enemies disrespect your laws.
PSA.119.140	All your promises glow with fire;
PSA.119.140	that’s why I’m a lover of your word.
PSA.119.141	Even though I’m considered insignificant and despised
PSA.119.141	by the world, I’ll never abandon your ways.
PSA.119.142	Your righteousness has no end; it is everlasting,
PSA.119.142	and your rules are perfectly fair.
PSA.119.143	Even though my troubles overwhelm me with anguish,
PSA.119.143	I still delight and cherish every message you speak to me.
PSA.119.144	Give me more revelation so that I can live for you,
PSA.119.144	for nothing is more pure and eternal than your truth.
PSA.119.145	Answer my passionate prayer, O Lord,
PSA.119.145	and I’ll obey everything you say.
PSA.119.146	Save me, God, and I’ll follow your every instruction.
PSA.119.147	Before the day dawns, I’ll be crying out for help
PSA.119.147	and wrapping your words into my life.
PSA.119.148	I lie awake every night pondering your promises to me.
PSA.119.149	Lord, listen to my heart’s cry, for I know your love is real for me;
PSA.119.149	breathe life into me again by the revelation of your justice.
PSA.119.150	Here they come—these lawless rebels are coming near,
PSA.119.150	but they are all so far away from your laws.
PSA.119.151	God, you are near me always, so close to me;
PSA.119.151	every one of your commands reveals truth.
PSA.119.152	I’ve known all along how true and unchanging
PSA.119.152	is every word you speak, established forever!
PSA.119.153	Look upon all my misery and come be my hero to rescue me,
PSA.119.153	for I will never forget what you’ve revealed to me.
PSA.119.154	Take my side and defend me in these sufferings;
PSA.119.154	redeem me and revive me, just like you promised you would.
PSA.119.155	The wicked are so far from salvation,
PSA.119.155	for they could not care less about your message of truth.
PSA.119.156	Your tender mercies are what I need, O God;
PSA.119.156	give me back my life again
PSA.119.156	through the revelation of your judgments.
PSA.119.157	I have so many enemies who persecute me,
PSA.119.157	yet I won’t swerve from following your ways.
PSA.119.158	I grieve when I see how the faithless ones live,
PSA.119.158	for they just walk away from your promises.
PSA.119.159	Lord, see how much I truly love your instructions.
PSA.119.159	So in your tender kindness, breathe life into me again.
PSA.119.160	The sum total of all your words adds up to absolute truth,
PSA.119.160	and every one of your righteous decrees is everlasting.
PSA.119.161	The powerful elite have persecuted me without a cause,
PSA.119.161	but my heart trembles in awe because of your miracle-words.
PSA.119.162	Your promises are the source of my bubbling joy;
PSA.119.162	the revelation of your word thrills me
PSA.119.162	like one who has discovered hidden treasure.
PSA.119.163	I despise every lie and hate every falsehood,
PSA.119.163	for I am passionate about keeping your precepts.
PSA.119.164	I stop to praise you seven times a day,
PSA.119.164	all because your ways are perfect!
PSA.119.165	There is such a great peace and well-being that comes
PSA.119.165	to the lovers of your word, and they will never be offended.
PSA.119.166	Lord, I’m longing for more of your salvation,
PSA.119.166	for I want to do what pleases you.
PSA.119.167	My love for your ways is indescribable;
PSA.119.167	in my innermost being I want to follow them perfectly!
PSA.119.168	I will keep your instructions and follow your counsel;
PSA.119.168	all my ways are an open book before you.
PSA.119.169	Lord, listen to my prayer. It’s like a sacrifice I bring to you;
PSA.119.169	I must have more revelation of your word!
PSA.119.170	Take my words to heart when I ask you, Lord;
PSA.119.170	rescue me, just like you promised!
PSA.119.171	I offer you my joyous praise for all that you’ve taught me.
PSA.119.172	Your wonderful words will become my song of worship,
PSA.119.172	for everything you’ve commanded is perfect and true.
PSA.119.173	Place your hands of strength and favor upon me,
PSA.119.173	for I’ve made my choice to follow your ways.
PSA.119.174	I wait for your deliverance, O Lord,
PSA.119.174	for your words thrill me like nothing else!
PSA.119.175	Invigorate my life so that I can praise you even more,
PSA.119.175	and may your truth be my strength!
PSA.119.176	I’ll never forget what you’ve taught me, Lord,
PSA.119.176	but when I wander off and lose my way,
PSA.119.176	come after me, for I am your beloved!
PSA.120.1	I was desperate for you to help me in my struggles, and you did!
PSA.120.2	So come and deliver me now
PSA.120.2	from this treachery and false accusation.
PSA.120.3	O lying deceivers, don’t you know what is your fate?
PSA.120.4	You will be pierced through with condemnation
PSA.120.4	and consumed with burning coals of fire!
PSA.120.5	Why am I doomed to live as an alien,
PSA.120.5	scattered among these cruel savages?
PSA.120.5	Am I destined to dwell in the darkened tents of desert nomads?
PSA.120.6	For too long I’ve had to live among those who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I speak words of peace while they speak words of war,
PSA.120.7	but they refuse to listen.
PSA.121.1+PSA.121.2	I look up to the mountains and hills, longing for God’s help.
PSA.121.1+PSA.121.2	But then I realize that our true help and protection
PSA.121.1+PSA.121.2	come only from the Lord,
PSA.121.1+PSA.121.2	our Creator who made the heavens and the earth.
PSA.121.3	He will guard and guide me, never letting me stumble or fall.
PSA.121.3	God is my keeper; he will never forget nor ignore me.
PSA.121.4	He will never slumber nor sleep;
PSA.121.4	he is the Guardian-God for his people, Israel.
PSA.121.5	Jehovah himself will watch over you;
PSA.121.5	he’s always at your side to shelter you safely in his presence.
PSA.121.6	He’s protecting you from all danger both day and night.
PSA.121.7	He will keep you from every form of evil or calamity
PSA.121.7	as he continually watches over you.
PSA.121.8	You will be guarded by God himself.
PSA.121.8	You will be safe when you leave your home
PSA.121.8	and safely you will return.
PSA.121.8	He will protect you now,
PSA.121.8	and he’ll protect you forevermore!
PSA.122.1	I was overjoyed when they said,
PSA.122.1	“Let’s go up to the house of the Lord.”
PSA.122.2	And now at last we stand here, inside the very gates of Jerusalem!
PSA.122.3	O Jerusalem, you were built as a city of praise,
PSA.122.3	where God and man mingle together.
PSA.122.4	This is where all the tribes of Yahweh are required
PSA.122.4	to come and worship him.
PSA.122.5	This is where the thrones of kings have been established
PSA.122.5	to rule in righteousness;
PSA.122.5	even King David ruled from here.
PSA.122.6	Pray 
PSA.122.6	for all who love her will prosper!
PSA.122.7	O Jerusalem, may there be peace for those
PSA.122.7	who dwell inside your walls
PSA.122.7	and prosperity in your every palace.
PSA.122.8	I intercede for the sake of my family and friends
PSA.122.8	who dwell there, that they may all live in peace.
PSA.122.9	For the sake of your house, Yahweh our God,
PSA.122.9	I will seek the welfare and prosperity of Jerusalem.
PSA.123.1	O God-Enthroned in heaven, I lift my eyes toward you in worship.
PSA.123.2	The way I love you
PSA.123.2	is like the way a servant wants to please his master,
PSA.123.2	the way a maid waits for the orders of her mistress.
PSA.123.2	We look to you, our God, with passionate longing
PSA.123.2	to please you and discover more of your mercy and grace.
PSA.123.3+PSA.123.4	For we’ve had more than our fill of this scoffing and scorn—
PSA.123.3+PSA.123.4	this mistreatment by the wealthy elite.
PSA.123.3+PSA.123.4	Lord, show us your mercy!
PSA.123.3+PSA.123.4	Lord, show us your grace!
PSA.124.1	What if God had not been on our side? Let all Israel admit this!
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3	What if God had not been there for us?
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3	Our enemies, in their violent anger,
PSA.124.2+PSA.124.3	would have swallowed us up alive!
PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	The nations, with their flood of rage, would have swept us away
PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	and we would have drowned,
PSA.124.4+PSA.124.5	perished beneath their torrent of terror!
PSA.124.6	We can praise God over and over that he never left us!
PSA.124.6	God wouldn’t allow the terror of our enemies to defeat us.
PSA.124.7	We are free from the hunter’s trap;
PSA.124.7	their snare is broken and we have escaped!
PSA.124.8	For the same God who made everything,
PSA.124.8	our Creator and our mighty maker,
PSA.124.8	he himself is our helper and defender!
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the Lord are as unshakeable,
PSA.125.1	as unmovable as mighty Mount Zion!
PSA.125.2	Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the Lord’s 
PSA.125.2	surrounds his people, protecting them now and forever.
PSA.125.3	The wicked will not always rule over the godly,
PSA.125.3	provoking them to do what is evil.
PSA.125.4	God, let your goodness be given away to your good people,
PSA.125.4	to all your godly lovers!
PSA.125.5	But those who turn away from truth,
PSA.125.5	you will turn them away from you, to follow their crooked ways.
PSA.125.5	May Israel experience peace and prosperity!
PSA.126.1	It was like a dream come true
PSA.126.1	when you freed us from our bondage and brought us back to Zion!
PSA.126.2	We laughed and laughed and overflowed with gladness.
PSA.126.2	We were left shouting for joy and singing your praise.
PSA.126.2	All the nations saw it and joined in, saying,
PSA.126.2	“The Lord has done great miracles for them!”
PSA.126.3	Yes, he did mighty miracles and we are overjoyed!
PSA.126.4	Now, Lord, do it again! Restore us to our former glory!
PSA.126.4	May streams of your refreshing flow over us
PSA.126.4	until our dry hearts are drenched again.
PSA.126.5	Those who sow their tears as seeds
PSA.126.5	will reap a harvest with joyful shouts of glee.
PSA.126.6	They may weep as they go out carrying their seed to sow,
PSA.126.6	but they will return with joyful laughter and shouting with gladness
PSA.126.6	as they bring back armloads of blessing and a harvest overflowing!
PSA.127.1	If God’s grace doesn’t help the builders,
PSA.127.1	they will labor in vain to build a house.
PSA.127.1	If God’s mercy doesn’t protect the city,
PSA.127.1	all the sentries will circle it in vain.
PSA.127.2	It really is senseless to work so hard
PSA.127.2	from early morning till late at night,
PSA.127.2	toiling to make a living for fear of not having enough.
PSA.127.2	God can provide for his lovers even while they sleep!
PSA.127.3	Children are God’s love-gift; they are heaven’s generous reward.
PSA.127.4	Children born to a young couple will one day rise to protect
PSA.127.4	and provide for their parents.
PSA.127.5	Happy will be the couple who has many of them!
PSA.127.5	A household full of children will not bring shame on your name
PSA.127.5	but victory when you face your enemies,
PSA.127.5	for your offspring will have influence and honor
PSA.127.5	to prevail on your behalf!
PSA.128.1	How joyous are those who love the Lord and bow low before God,
PSA.128.1	ready to obey him!
PSA.128.2	Your reward will be prosperity, happiness, and well-being.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will bless your heart and home.
PSA.128.3	Your children will bring you joy as they gather around your table.
PSA.128.4	Yes, this is God’s generous reward for those who love him.
PSA.128.5	May the Lord bless you out of his Zion-glory!
PSA.128.5	May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
PSA.128.5	throughout your lifetime.
PSA.128.6	And may you be surrounded by your grandchildren.
PSA.128.6	Happiness to you! And happiness to Israel!
PSA.129.1	Let all Israel admit it.
PSA.129.1	From our very beginning we have been persecuted by the nations.
PSA.129.2	And from our very beginning
PSA.129.2	we have faced never-ending discrimination.
PSA.129.2	Nevertheless, our enemies have not defeated us. We’re still here!
PSA.129.3	They have hurt us more than can be expressed,
PSA.129.3	ripping us to shreds, cutting deeply into our souls.
PSA.129.4	But no matter what, the Lord is good to us.
PSA.129.4	He is a righteous God who stood to defend us,
PSA.129.4	breaking the chains of the evil ones that bound us.
PSA.129.5	May all who hate the Jews
PSA.129.5	fall back in disgrace to a shameful defeat!
PSA.129.6	Let them be like grass planted in shallow soil
PSA.129.6	that soon withers with no sustenance.
PSA.129.7	Let them be like weeds ignored by the reaper
PSA.129.7	and worthless to the harvester.
PSA.129.8	Let no one who sees them say,
PSA.129.8	“May the blessings of Jehovah be upon your life.
PSA.129.8	May the Lord bless you.”
PSA.130.1	Lord, I cry out to you out of the depths of my despair!
PSA.130.2	Hear my voice, O God!
PSA.130.2	Answer this prayer and hear my plea for mercy.
PSA.130.3	Lord, if you measured us and marked us with our sins,
PSA.130.3	who would ever have their prayers answered?
PSA.130.4	But your forgiving love is what makes you so wonderful.
PSA.130.4	No wonder you are loved and worshiped!
PSA.130.5	This is why I wait upon you, expecting your breakthrough,
PSA.130.5	for your word brings me hope.
PSA.130.6	I long for you more than any watchman
PSA.130.6	would long for the morning light.
PSA.130.6	I will watch and wait for you, O God,
PSA.130.6	throughout the night.
PSA.130.7	O Israel, keep hoping, keep trusting,
PSA.130.7	and keep waiting on the Lord,
PSA.130.7	for he is tenderhearted, kind, and forgiving.
PSA.130.7	He has a thousand ways to set you free!
PSA.130.8	He himself will redeem you;
PSA.130.8	he will ransom you from the cruel slavery of your sins!
PSA.131.1	Lord, my heart is meek before you.
PSA.131.1	I don’t consider myself better than others.
PSA.131.1	I’m content to not pursue matters that are over my head—
PSA.131.1	such as your complex mysteries and wonders—
PSA.131.1	that I’m not yet ready to understand.
PSA.131.2	I am humbled and quieted in your presence.
PSA.131.2	Like a contented child who rests on its mother’s lap,
PSA.131.2	I’m your resting child and my soul is content in you.
PSA.131.3	O people of God, your time has come to quietly trust,
PSA.131.3	waiting upon the Lord now and forever.
PSA.132.1	Lord, please don’t forget all the hardships
PSA.132.1	David had to pass through.
PSA.132.2	And how he promised you, Jacob’s mighty God, saying,
PSA.132.3	“I will not cross the threshold of my own home
PSA.132.3	to sleep in my own bed.
PSA.132.4	I will not sleep or slumber,
PSA.132.4	nor even take time to close my eyes in rest,
PSA.132.5	until I find a place for you to dwell, O mighty God of Jacob.
PSA.132.5	I devote myself to finding a resting place for you!”
PSA.132.6	First we heard that the ark was at Bethlehem.
PSA.132.6	Then we found it in the forest of Kiriath-Jearim.
PSA.132.7	Let’s go into God’s dwelling place
PSA.132.7	and bow down and worship before him.
PSA.132.8	Arise, O Lord, and enter your resting place,
PSA.132.8	both you and the ark of your glorious strength!
PSA.132.9	May your priests wear the robes of righteousness,
PSA.132.9	and let all your godly lovers sing for joy!
PSA.132.10	Don’t forsake your anointed king now,
PSA.132.10	but honor your servant David.
PSA.132.11	For you gave your word and promised David
PSA.132.11	in an unbreakable oath that one of his sons
PSA.132.11	would be sitting on the throne to succeed him as king.
PSA.132.12	You also promised that if David’s sons
PSA.132.12	would be faithful to keep their promise to follow you,
PSA.132.12	obeying the words you spoke to them,
PSA.132.12	then David’s dynasty would never end.
PSA.132.13	Lord, you have chosen Zion as your dwelling place,
PSA.132.13	for your pleasure is fulfilled in making it your home.
PSA.132.14	I hear you say, “I will make this place my eternal dwelling,
PSA.132.14	for I have loved and desired it as my very own!
PSA.132.15	I will make Zion prosper and
PSA.132.15	satisfy her poor with my provision.
PSA.132.16	I will cover my priests with salvation’s power,
PSA.132.16	and all my godly lovers will shout for joy!
PSA.132.17	I will increase the anointing that was upon David,
PSA.132.17	and my glistening glory will rest upon my chosen ones.
PSA.132.18	But David’s enemies will be covered with shame,
PSA.132.18	while on them I will make holiness bloom!”
PSA.133.1	How truly wonderful and delightful
PSA.133.1	to see brothers and sisters living together in sweet unity!
PSA.133.2	It’s as precious as the sacred scented oil
PSA.133.2	flowing from the head of the high priest Aaron,
PSA.133.2	dripping down upon his beard and running all the way down
PSA.133.2	to the hem of his priestly robes.
PSA.133.3	This heavenly harmony can be compared to the dew
PSA.133.3	dripping down from the skies upon Mount Hermon,
PSA.133.3	refreshing the mountain slopes of Israel.
PSA.133.3	For from this realm of sweet harmony
PSA.133.3	God will release his eternal blessing, the promise of life forever!
PSA.134.1	All his loving priests who serve and sing,
PSA.134.1	come and sing your song of blessing to God.
PSA.134.1	Come and stand before him in the house of God
PSA.134.1	throughout the night watch,
PSA.134.2	lifting up your hands in holy worship; come and bless the Lord!
PSA.134.3	May the Lord, whom you worship,
PSA.134.3	the mighty maker of heaven and earth,
PSA.134.3	bless you from Zion’s glory!
PSA.135.1	Shout hallelujah and praise the greatness of God!
PSA.135.1	All his godly lovers, praise him!
PSA.135.2	All you worshiping priests on duty in the temple,
PSA.135.3	praise him, for he is beautiful!
PSA.135.3	Sing loving praises to his lovely name.
PSA.135.4	For Yahweh has chosen Jacob for his own purpose,
PSA.135.4	and Israel is his special treasure.
PSA.135.5	Next to every other god the greatness of our God is unequaled.
PSA.135.5	For our God is incomparable!
PSA.135.6	He does what he pleases, with unlimited power and authority,
PSA.135.6	extending his greatness throughout the entire universe!
PSA.135.7	He forms the misty clouds and creates thunder and lightning,
PSA.135.7	bringing the wind and rain out of his heavenly storehouse.
PSA.135.8	He struck down the eldest child in each Egyptian home;
PSA.135.8	both men and beast perished that night.
PSA.135.9	He did great miracles—mighty signs and wonders throughout the land
PSA.135.9	before Pharaoh and all his subjects.
PSA.135.10	He conquered many nations and killed their mighty kings,
PSA.135.11	like Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and kings from every kingdom in Canaan.
PSA.135.12	He gave their land to Israel as an inheritance for his people.
PSA.135.13	O Jehovah, your name endures forever!
PSA.135.13	Your fame is known in every generation.
PSA.135.14	For you will vindicate your persecuted people,
PSA.135.14	showing your tender love to all your servants.
PSA.135.15	The unbelieving nations worship what they make.
PSA.135.15	They worship their wealth and their work.
PSA.135.15	They idolize what they own and what they do.
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	Their possessions will never satisfy.
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	Their lifeless and futile works cannot bring life to them!
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	Their things can’t talk to them or answer their prayers.
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	Blind men can only create blind things.
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	Those deaf to God can only make a deaf image.
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	Dead men can only create dead idols.
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	And everyone who trusts in these powerless, dead things
PSA.135.16+PSA.135.17+PSA.135.18	will be just like what they worship—powerless and dead!
PSA.135.19	Praise Lord-Yahweh, all the families of Israel!
PSA.135.19	Praise Lord-Yahweh, you family of Aaron!
PSA.135.20	Let all the priests bless Lord-Yahweh!
PSA.135.20	Let all his lovers who bow low before him
PSA.135.20	praise the Lord-Yahweh!
PSA.135.21	So bless the Lord-Yahweh who lives in Jerusalem
PSA.135.21	and dwells in Zion’s glory!
PSA.135.21	Hallelujah and praise the Lord!
PSA.136.1	Let everyone thank God, for he is good, and he is easy to please!
PSA.136.1	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.2	Give thanks to God, our King over all gods!
PSA.136.2	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.3	Give thanks to the Lord over all lords!

PSA.136.6	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.7	Praise the one who created every heavenly light!
PSA.136.7	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.8	He set the sun in the sky to rule over day!
PSA.136.8	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.9	Praise him who set in place the moon and stars to rule over the night!
PSA.136.9	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.10	Give thanks to God, who struck down the firstborn in Egypt!
PSA.136.10	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.11	He brought his people out of Egypt with miracles!
PSA.136.11	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.12	With his mighty power he brought them out!
PSA.136.12	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.13	He split open the Red Sea for them!
PSA.136.13	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.14	And led his people right through the middle!
PSA.136.14	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.15	He vanquished Pharaoh’s armies, drowning them all!
PSA.136.15	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.16	He led his people through the wilderness!
PSA.136.16	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.17	He’s the one who smashed mighty kingdoms!
PSA.136.17	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.18	He triumphed over powerful kings who stood in his way!
PSA.136.18	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.19	He conquered Sihon, king of the Amorites!
PSA.136.19	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.20	He conquered the giant named Og, king of Bashan!
PSA.136.20	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.21	Then he gave away their lands as an inheritance!
PSA.136.21	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.22	For he handed it all over to Israel, his beloved!
PSA.136.22	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.23	He’s the God who chose us when we were nothing!
PSA.136.23	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.24	He has rescued us from the power of our enemies!
PSA.136.24	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.25	He provides food for hungry men and animals!
PSA.136.25	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.136.26	Give thanks to the great God of the heavens!
PSA.136.26	His tender love for us continues on forever!
PSA.137.1	Along the banks of Babylon’s rivers
PSA.137.1	we sat as exiles, mourning our captivity,
PSA.137.1	and wept with great love for Zion.
PSA.137.2	We hung up our harps on the willow trees.
PSA.137.3	Our captors tormented us, saying, “Make music for us and
PSA.137.3	sing one of your happy Zion-songs!”
PSA.137.4	But how could we sing the song of the Lord
PSA.137.4	in this foreign wilderness?
PSA.137.5	May my hands never make music again
PSA.137.5	if I ever forget you, O Jerusalem.
PSA.137.6	May I never be able to sing again if I fail to honor Jerusalem supremely!
PSA.137.7	And Lord, may you never forget
PSA.137.7	what the sons of Edom did to us, saying,
PSA.137.7	“Let’s raze the city of Jerusalem and burn it to the ground!”
PSA.137.8	Listen, O Babylon, you evil destroyer!
PSA.137.8	The one who destroys you will be rewarded above all others.
PSA.137.8	You will be repaid for what you’ve done to us.
PSA.137.9	Great honor will come to those who destroy you and your future,
PSA.137.9	by smashing your infants against the rubble of your own destruction.
PSA.138.1	I thank you, Lord, and with all the passion of my heart
PSA.138.1	I worship you in the presence of angels!
PSA.138.1	Heaven’s mighty ones will hear my voice
PSA.138.1	as I sing my loving praise to you.
PSA.138.2	I bow down before your divine presence
PSA.138.2	and bring you my deepest worship
PSA.138.2	as I experience your tender love and your living truth.
PSA.138.2	For the promises of your word and the fame of your name
PSA.138.2	have been magnified above all else!
PSA.138.3	At the very moment I called out to you, you answered me!
PSA.138.3	You strengthened me deep within my soul
PSA.138.3	and breathed fresh courage into me.
PSA.138.4	One day all the kings of the earth
PSA.138.4	will rise to give you thanks when they hear the living words
PSA.138.4	that I have heard you speak.
PSA.138.5	They too will sing of your wonderful ways,
PSA.138.5	for your ineffable glory is great!
PSA.138.6	For though you are lofty and exalted,
PSA.138.6	you stoop to embrace the lowly.
PSA.138.6	Yet you keep your distance from those filled with pride.
PSA.138.7	By your mighty power I can walk through any devastation
PSA.138.7	and you will keep me alive, reviving me.
PSA.138.7	Your power set me free from the hatred of my enemies.
PSA.138.8	You keep every promise you’ve ever made to me!
PSA.138.8	Since your love for me is constant and endless,
PSA.138.8	I ask you, Lord, to finish every good thing that you’ve begun in me!
PSA.139.1	Lord, you know everything there is to know about me.
PSA.139.2	You perceive every movement of my heart and soul,
PSA.139.2	and you understand my every thought before it even enters my mind.
PSA.139.3+PSA.139.4	You are so intimately aware of me, Lord.
PSA.139.3+PSA.139.4	You read my heart like an open book
PSA.139.3+PSA.139.4	and you know all the words I’m about to speak
PSA.139.3+PSA.139.4	before I even start a sentence!
PSA.139.3+PSA.139.4	You know every step I will take before my journey even begins.
PSA.139.5	You’ve gone into my future to prepare the way,
PSA.139.5	and in kindness you follow behind me
PSA.139.5	to spare me from the harm of my past.
PSA.139.5	With your hand of love upon my life,
PSA.139.5	you impart a blessing to me.
PSA.139.6	This is just too wonderful, deep, and incomprehensible!
PSA.139.6	Your understanding of me brings me wonder and strength.
PSA.139.7	Where could I go from your Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Where could I run and hide from your face?
PSA.139.8	If I go up to heaven, you’re there!
PSA.139.8	If I go down to the realm of the dead, you’re there too!
PSA.139.9	If I fly with wings into the shining dawn, you’re there!
PSA.139.9	If I fly into the radiant sunset, you’re there waiting!
PSA.139.10	Wherever I go, your hand will guide me;
PSA.139.10	your strength will empower me.
PSA.139.11	It’s impossible to disappear from you
PSA.139.11	or to ask the darkness to hide me,
PSA.139.11	for your presence is everywhere, bringing light into my night.
PSA.139.12	There is no such thing as darkness with you.
PSA.139.12	The night, to you, is as bright as the day;
PSA.139.12	there’s no difference between the two.
PSA.139.13	You formed my innermost being, shaping my delicate inside
PSA.139.13	and my intricate outside,
PSA.139.13	and wove them all together in my mother’s womb.
PSA.139.14	I thank you, God, for making me so mysteriously complex!
PSA.139.14	Everything you do is marvelously breathtaking.
PSA.139.14	It simply amazes me to think about it!
PSA.139.14	How thoroughly you know me, Lord!
PSA.139.15	You even formed every bone in my body
PSA.139.15	when you created me in the secret place,
PSA.139.15	carefully, skillfully shaping me from nothing to something.
PSA.139.16	You saw who you created me to be before I became me!
PSA.139.16	Before I’d ever seen the light of day,
PSA.139.16	the number of days you planned for me
PSA.139.16	were already recorded in your book.
PSA.139.17+PSA.139.18	Every single moment you are thinking of me!
PSA.139.17+PSA.139.18	How precious and wonderful to consider
PSA.139.17+PSA.139.18	that you cherish me constantly in your every thought!
PSA.139.17+PSA.139.18	O God, your desires toward me are more
PSA.139.17+PSA.139.18	than the grains of sand on every shore!
PSA.139.17+PSA.139.18	When I awake each morning, you’re still with me.
PSA.139.19	O God, come and slay these bloodthirsty, murderous men!
PSA.139.19	For I cry out, “Depart from me, you wicked ones!”
PSA.139.20	See how they blaspheme your sacred name
PSA.139.20	and lift up themselves against you, but all in vain!
PSA.139.21	Lord, can’t you see how I despise those who despise you?
PSA.139.21	For I grieve when I see them rise up against you.
PSA.139.22	I have nothing but complete hatred and disgust for them.
PSA.139.22	Your enemies shall be my enemies!
PSA.139.23	God, I invite your searching gaze into my heart.
PSA.139.23	Examine me through and through;
PSA.139.23	find out everything that may be hidden within me.
PSA.139.23	Put me to the test and sift through all my anxious cares.
PSA.139.24	See if there is any path of pain I’m walking on,
PSA.139.24	and lead me back to your glorious, everlasting ways—
PSA.139.24	the path that brings me back to you.
PSA.140.1	Lord, protect me from this evil one!
PSA.140.1	Rescue me from these violent schemes!
PSA.140.2	He concocts his secret strategy to divide and harm others,
PSA.140.2	stirring up trouble one against another.
PSA.140.3	They are known for their sharp rhetoric
PSA.140.3	of poisonous, hateful words.
PSA.140.3	Pause in his presence
PSA.140.4	Keep me safe, Lord, out of reach from these wicked and violent men,
PSA.140.4	and guard me, God, for they have plotted an evil scheme
PSA.140.4	to ruin me and bring me down.
PSA.140.5	They are proud and insolent; they’ve set an ambush for me in secret.
PSA.140.5	They are determined to snare me in their net like captured prey.
PSA.140.5	Pause in his presence
PSA.140.6+PSA.140.7	O Lord, you are my God and my saving strength!
PSA.140.6+PSA.140.7	My Hero-God, you wrap yourself around me to protect me.
PSA.140.6+PSA.140.7	For I’m surrounded by your presence in my day of battle.
PSA.140.6+PSA.140.7	Lord Yahweh, hear my cry.
PSA.140.6+PSA.140.7	May my voice move your heart to show me mercy.
PSA.140.8	Don’t let the wicked triumph over me,
PSA.140.8	but bring down their every strategy to subdue me
PSA.140.8	or they will become even more arrogant!
PSA.140.8	Pause in his presence
PSA.140.9	Those who surround me are nothing but proud troublemakers.
PSA.140.9	May they drink the poison of their own poisonous words.
PSA.140.10+PSA.140.11	May their slanderous lives never prosper!
PSA.140.10+PSA.140.11	Let evil itself hunt them down and pursue them relentlessly
PSA.140.10+PSA.140.11	until they are thrown into fiery pits
PSA.140.10+PSA.140.11	from which they will never get out!
PSA.140.10+PSA.140.11	Let burning coals of hellfire fall upon their heads!
PSA.140.12	For I know, Lord, that you will be the hero
PSA.140.12	of all those they persecute,
PSA.140.12	and you will secure justice for the poor.
PSA.140.13	Your godly lovers will thank you no matter what happens.
PSA.140.13	For they choose and cherish your presence
PSA.140.13	above everything else!
PSA.141.1	Please, Lord, come close and come quickly to help me!
PSA.141.1	Listen to my prayer as I call out to you.
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be as the evening sacrifice
PSA.141.2	that burns like fragrant incense, rising as my offering to you
PSA.141.2	as I lift up my hands in surrendered worship!
PSA.141.3	God, give me grace to guard my lips
PSA.141.3	from speaking what is wrong.
PSA.141.4	Guide me away from temptation and doing evil.
PSA.141.4	Save me from sinful habits and from keeping company
PSA.141.4	with those who are experts in evil.
PSA.141.4	Help me not to share in their sin in any way!
PSA.141.5	When one of your godly lovers corrects me
PSA.141.5	or one of your faithful ones rebukes me,
PSA.141.5	I will accept it like an honor I cannot refuse.
PSA.141.5	It will be as healing medicine that I swallow
PSA.141.5	without an offended heart.
PSA.141.5	Even if they are mistaken, I will continue to pray.
PSA.141.6	When the leaders and judges are condemned,
PSA.141.6	falling upon the rocks of justice,
PSA.141.6	then they’ll know my words to them were true!
PSA.141.7	Like an earthquake splits open the earth,
PSA.141.7	so the world of hell will open its mouth
PSA.141.7	to swallow their scattered bones.
PSA.141.8	But you are my Lord and my God; I only have eyes for you!
PSA.141.8	I hide myself in you, so don’t leave me defenseless.
PSA.141.9	Protect me! Keep me from the traps of wickedness they set for me.
PSA.141.10	Let them all stumble into their own traps
PSA.141.10	while I escape without a scratch!
PSA.142.1	God, I’m crying out to you!
PSA.142.1	I lift up my voice boldly to beg for your mercy.
PSA.142.2	I spill out my heart to you and tell you all my troubles.
PSA.142.3	For when I was desperate, overwhelmed, and about to give up,
PSA.142.3	you were the only one there to help.
PSA.142.3	You gave me a way of escape
PSA.142.3	from the hidden traps of my enemies.
PSA.142.4	I look to my left and right to see if there is anyone who will help,
PSA.142.4	but there’s no one who takes notice of me.
PSA.142.4	I have no hope of escape, and no one cares whether I live or die.
PSA.142.5	So I cried out to you, Lord, my only hiding place.
PSA.142.5	You’re all I have, my only hope in this life,
PSA.142.5	my last chance for help.
PSA.142.6	Please listen to my heart’s cry,
PSA.142.6	for I am low and in desperate need of you!
PSA.142.6	Rescue me from all those who persecute me,
PSA.142.6	for I am no match for them.
PSA.142.7	Bring me out of this dungeon so I can declare your praise!
PSA.142.7	And all your godly lovers will celebrate
PSA.142.7	all the wonderful things you’ve done for me!
PSA.143.1	Lord, you must hear my prayer,
PSA.143.1	for you are faithful to your promises.
PSA.143.1	Answer my cry, O righteous God!
PSA.143.2	Don’t bring me into your courtroom for judgment,
PSA.143.2	for there is no one who is righteous before you.
PSA.143.3	My enemies have chased and caught me
PSA.143.3	and crushed my life into dust.
PSA.143.3	Now I’m living in the darkness of death’s shadow.
PSA.143.4	My inner being is in depression
PSA.143.4	and my heart is heavy, dazed with despair.
PSA.143.5	I remember the glorious miracles of days gone by,
PSA.143.5	and I often think of all the wonders of old.
PSA.143.6	Now I’m reaching out to you, thirsting for you
PSA.143.6	like the dry, cracked ground thirsts for rain.
PSA.143.6	Pause in his presence
PSA.143.7	Lord, come quickly and answer me,
PSA.143.7	for my depression deepens and I’m about to give up.
PSA.143.7	Don’t leave me now or I’ll die!
PSA.143.8	Let the dawning day bring me revelation
PSA.143.8	of your tender, unfailing love.
PSA.143.8	Give me light for my path and teach me, for I trust in you.
PSA.143.9	Save me from all my enemies, for I hide myself in you.
PSA.143.10	I just want to obey all you ask of me.
PSA.143.10	So teach me, Lord, for you are my God.
PSA.143.10	Your gracious Spirit is all I need, so lead me on good paths
PSA.143.10	that are pleasing to you, my one and only God!
PSA.143.11	Lord, if you rescue me, it will bring you more glory,
PSA.143.11	for you are true to your promises.
PSA.143.11	Bring me out of these troubles!
PSA.143.12	Since I am your loving servant, destroy all those
PSA.143.12	who are trying to harm me.
PSA.143.12	And because you are so loving and kind to me,
PSA.143.12	silence all of my enemies!
PSA.144.1	There is only one strong, safe, and secure place for me;
PSA.144.1	it’s in God alone and I love him!
PSA.144.1	He’s the one who gives me strength and skill for the battle.
PSA.144.2	He’s my shelter of love and my fortress of faith,
PSA.144.2	who wraps himself around me as a secure shield.
PSA.144.2	I hide myself in this one who subdues enemies before me.
PSA.144.3	Lord, what is it about us that you would even notice us?
PSA.144.3	Why do you even bother with us?
PSA.144.4	For man is nothing but a faint whisper, a mere breath.
PSA.144.4	We spend our days like nothing more than a passing shadow.
PSA.144.5	Step down from heaven, Lord, and come down!
PSA.144.5	Make the mountains melt at your touch.
PSA.144.6	Loose your fiery lightning flashes and scatter your enemies.
PSA.144.6	Overthrow them with your terrifying judgments.
PSA.144.7	Reach down from your heavens
PSA.144.7	and rescue me from this hell,
PSA.144.7	and deliver me from these dark powers.
PSA.144.8	They speak nothing but lies; their words are pure deceit.
PSA.144.8	Nothing they say can ever be trusted.
PSA.144.9	My God, I will sing you a brand-new song!
PSA.144.9	The harp inside my heart will make music to you!
PSA.144.10	I will sing of you, the one who gives victory to kings—
PSA.144.10	the one who rescues David, your loving servant,
PSA.144.10	from the fatal sword.
PSA.144.11	Deliver me and save me from these dark powers
PSA.144.11	who speak nothing but lies.
PSA.144.11	Their words are pure deceit
PSA.144.11	and you can’t trust anything they say.
PSA.144.12	Deliver us! Then our homes will be happy.
PSA.144.12	Our sons will grow up as strong, sturdy men
PSA.144.12	and our daughters with graceful beauty,
PSA.144.12	royally fashioned as for a palace.
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	Our barns will be filled to the brim,
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	overflowing with the fruits of our harvest.
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	Our fields will be full of sheep and cattle,
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	too many to count,
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	and our livestock will not miscarry their young.
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	Our enemies will not invade our land,
PSA.144.13+PSA.144.14	and there’ll be no breach in our walls.
PSA.144.15	What bliss we experience when these blessings fall!
PSA.144.15	The people who love and serve our God will be happy indeed!
PSA.145.1	My heart explodes with praise to you!
PSA.145.1	Now and forever my heart bows in worship to you,
PSA.145.1	my King and my God!
PSA.145.2	Every day I will lift up my praise to your name
PSA.145.2	with praises that will last throughout eternity.
PSA.145.3	Lord, you are great and worthy of the highest praise!
PSA.145.3	For there is no end to the discovery
PSA.145.3	of the greatness that surrounds you.
PSA.145.4	Generation after generation will declare more of your greatness
PSA.145.4	and declare more of your glory.
PSA.145.5	Your magnificent splendor and the miracles of your majesty
PSA.145.5	are my constant meditation.
PSA.145.6	Your awe-inspiring acts of power have everyone talking!
PSA.145.6	I’m telling people everywhere about your excellent greatness!
PSA.145.7	Our hearts bubble over as we celebrate the fame
PSA.145.7	of your marvelous beauty, 
PSA.145.7	We shout with ecstatic joy over your breakthrough for us.
PSA.145.8	You’re kind and tenderhearted to those who don’t deserve it
PSA.145.8	and very patient with people who fail you.
PSA.145.8	Your love is like a flooding river overflowing its banks with kindness.
PSA.145.9	God, everyone sees your goodness,
PSA.145.9	for your tender love is blended into everything you do.
PSA.145.10	Everything you have made will praise you, fulfilling its purpose.
PSA.145.10	And all your godly lovers will be found bowing before you.
PSA.145.11	They will tell the world of the lavish splendor of your kingdom
PSA.145.11	and preach about your limitless power.
PSA.145.12	They will demonstrate for all to see your miracles of might
PSA.145.12	and reveal the glorious majesty of your kingdom.
PSA.145.13	You are the Lord who reigns over your never-ending kingdom through all the ages of time and eternity!
PSA.145.13	You are faithful to fulfill every promise you’ve made.
PSA.145.13	You manifest yourself as kindness in all you do.
PSA.145.14	Weak and feeble ones you will sustain.
PSA.145.14	Those bent over with burdens of shame you will lift up.
PSA.145.15	You have captured our attention
PSA.145.15	and the eyes of all look to you.
PSA.145.15	You give what they hunger for at just the right time.
PSA.145.16	When you open your generous hand, it’s full of blessings,
PSA.145.16	satisfying the longings of every living thing.
PSA.145.17	You are fair and righteous in everything you do,
PSA.145.17	and your love is wrapped into all your works.
PSA.145.18	You draw near to those who call out to you,
PSA.145.18	listening closely, especially when their hearts are true.
PSA.145.19	Every one of your godly lovers receives
PSA.145.19	even more than what they ask for.
PSA.145.19	For you hear what their hearts really long for
PSA.145.19	and you bring them your saving strength.
PSA.145.20	God, you watch carefully over all your lovers like a bodyguard,
PSA.145.20	but you will destroy the ungodly.
PSA.145.21	I will praise you, Lord!
PSA.145.21	Let everyone everywhere join me in praising
PSA.145.21	the beautiful Lord of holiness from now through eternity!
PSA.146.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.146.1	My innermost being will praise you, Lord!
PSA.146.2	I will spend my life praising you and
PSA.146.2	singing high praises to you, my God, every day of my life!
PSA.146.3+PSA.146.4	We can never look to men for help;
PSA.146.3+PSA.146.4	no matter who they are, they can’t save us,
PSA.146.3+PSA.146.4	for even our great leaders fail and fall.
PSA.146.3+PSA.146.4	They too are just mortals who will one day die.
PSA.146.3+PSA.146.4	At death the spirits of all depart and their bodies return to dust.
PSA.146.3+PSA.146.4	In the day of their death all their projects and plans are over.
PSA.146.5	But those who hope in the Lord will be happy and pleased!
PSA.146.5	Our help comes from the God of Jacob!
PSA.146.6	You keep all your promises.
PSA.146.6	You are the Creator of heaven’s glory,
PSA.146.6	earth’s grandeur, and ocean’s greatness.
PSA.146.7	The oppressed get justice with you.
PSA.146.7	The hungry are satisfied with you.
PSA.146.7	Prisoners find their freedom with you.
PSA.146.8	You open the eyes of the blind
PSA.146.8	and you fully restore those bent over with shame.
PSA.146.8	You love those who love and honor you.
PSA.146.9	You watch over strangers and immigrants
PSA.146.9	and support the fatherless and widows.
PSA.146.9	But you subvert the plans of the ungodly.
PSA.146.10	Lord, you will reign forever!
PSA.146.10	Zion’s God will rule throughout time and eternity!
PSA.146.10	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.147.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.147.1	How beautiful it is when we sing our praises to the beautiful God,
PSA.147.1	for praise makes you lovely before him
PSA.147.1	and brings him great delight!
PSA.147.2	The Lord builds up Jerusalem;
PSA.147.2	he gathers up the outcasts and brings them home.
PSA.147.3	He heals the wounds of every shattered heart.
PSA.147.4	He sets his stars in place, calling them all by their names.
PSA.147.5	How great is our God!
PSA.147.5	There’s absolutely nothing his power cannot accomplish,
PSA.147.5	and he has infinite understanding of everything.
PSA.147.6	God supports and strengthens the humble,
PSA.147.6	but the ungodly will be brought down to the dust.
PSA.147.7	Sing out with songs of thanksgiving to the Lord!
PSA.147.7	Let’s sing our praises with melodies overflowing!
PSA.147.8	He fills the sky with clouds, sending showers to water the earth
PSA.147.8	so that the grass springs up on the mountain fields
PSA.147.8	and the earth produces food for man.
PSA.147.9	All the birds and beasts who cry with hunger to him
PSA.147.9	are fed from his hands.
PSA.147.10	His people don’t find security in strong horses,
PSA.147.10	for horsepower is nothing to him.
PSA.147.10	Man power is even less impressive!
PSA.147.11	The Lord shows favor to those who fear him,
PSA.147.11	to his godly lovers who wait for his tender embrace.
PSA.147.12	Jerusalem, praise the Lord! Zion, worship your God!
PSA.147.13	For he has strengthened the authority of your gates.
PSA.147.13	He even blesses you with more children.
PSA.147.14	He’s the one who brings peace to your borders,
PSA.147.14	feeding you the most excellent of fare.
PSA.147.15	He sends out his orders throughout the world;
PSA.147.15	his words run as swift messengers, bringing them to pass.
PSA.147.16	He blankets the earth with glistening snow,
PSA.147.16	painting the landscape with frost.
PSA.147.17	Sleet and hail fall from the sky,
PSA.147.17	causing waters to freeze before winter’s icy blast.
PSA.147.18	Then he speaks his word and it all melts away;
PSA.147.18	as the warm spring winds blow, the streams begin to flow.
PSA.147.19	In the same way, he speaks his word to Jacob,
PSA.147.19	and to Israel he brings his life-giving instruction.
PSA.147.20	He has dealt with Israel differently than with any other people,
PSA.147.20	for they have received his laws.
PSA.147.20	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.148.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Let the skies be filled with praise
PSA.148.1	and the highest heavens with the shouts of glory!
PSA.148.2	Go ahead—praise him, all you his messengers!
PSA.148.2	Praise him some more, all you heavenly hosts!
PSA.148.3	Keep it up, sun and moon!
PSA.148.3	Don’t stop now, all you twinkling stars of light!
PSA.148.4	Take it up even higher—up to the highest heavens,
PSA.148.4	until the cosmic chorus thunders his praise!
PSA.148.5	Let the entire universe erupt with praise to God.
PSA.148.5	From nothing to something he spoke and created it all.
PSA.148.6	He established the cosmos to last forever,
PSA.148.6	and he stands behind his commands
PSA.148.6	so his orders will never be revoked.
PSA.148.7	Let the earth join in with this parade of praise!
PSA.148.7	You mighty creatures of the ocean’s depths,
PSA.148.7	echo in exaltation!
PSA.148.8	Lightning, hail, snow, and clouds,
PSA.148.8	and the stormy winds that fulfill his word.
PSA.148.9	Bring your melody, O mountains and hills;
PSA.148.9	trees of the forest and field, harmonize your praise!
PSA.148.10+PSA.148.11+PSA.148.12	Praise him, all beasts and birds, mice and men,
PSA.148.10+PSA.148.11+PSA.148.12	kings, queens, princes, and princesses,
PSA.148.10+PSA.148.11+PSA.148.12	young men and maidens, children and babes,
PSA.148.10+PSA.148.11+PSA.148.12	old and young alike, everyone everywhere!
PSA.148.13	Let them all join in with this orchestra of praise.
PSA.148.13	For the name of the Lord is the only name we raise!
PSA.148.13	His stunning splendor ascends higher than the heavens.
PSA.148.14	He anoints his people with strength and authority,
PSA.148.14	showing his great favor to all his godly lovers,
PSA.148.14	even to his princely people, Israel,
PSA.148.14	who are so close to his heart.
PSA.148.14	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.149.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.149.1	It’s time to sing to God a brand-new song
PSA.149.1	so that all his holy people will hear how wonderful he is!
PSA.149.2	May Israel be enthused with joy because of him,
PSA.149.2	and may the sons of Zion pour out
PSA.149.2	their joyful praises to their King.
PSA.149.3	Break forth with dancing!
PSA.149.3	Make music and sing God’s praises with the rhythm of drums!
PSA.149.4	For he enjoys his faithful lovers.
PSA.149.4	He adorns the humble with his beauty
PSA.149.4	and he loves to give them the victory.
PSA.149.5	His godly lovers triumph in the glory of God,
PSA.149.5	and their joyful praises will rise even while others sleep.
PSA.149.6	God’s high and holy praises fill their mouths,
PSA.149.6	for their shouted praises are their weapons of war!
PSA.149.7	These warring weapons will bring vengeance
PSA.149.7	on every opposing force and every resistant power—
PSA.149.8	to bind kings with chains and rulers with iron shackles.
PSA.149.9	Praise-filled warriors will enforce
PSA.149.9	the judgment-doom decreed against their enemies.
PSA.149.9	This is the glorious honor he gives to all his godly lovers.
PSA.149.9	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PSA.150.1	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Praise God in his holy sanctuary!
PSA.150.1	Praise him in his stronghold in the sky!
PSA.150.2	Praise him for his miracles of might!
PSA.150.2	Praise him for his magnificent greatness!
PSA.150.3	Praise him with the trumpets blasting!
PSA.150.3	Praise him with piano and guitar!
PSA.150.4+PSA.150.5	Praise him with drums and dancing!
PSA.150.4+PSA.150.5	Praise him with the loud, resounding clash of cymbals!
PSA.150.4+PSA.150.5	Praise him with every instrument you can find!
PSA.150.6	Let everyone everywhere join in the crescendo
PSA.150.6	of ecstatic praise to Yahweh!
PSA.150.6	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
PRO.1.1	Here are kingdom revelations, words to live by,
PRO.1.1	and words of wisdom given to empower you to reign in life,
PRO.1.1	written as proverbs by Israel’s King Solomon, David’s son.
PRO.1.2	Within these sayings will be found the revelation of wisdom
PRO.1.2	and the impartation of spiritual understanding.
PRO.1.2	Use them as keys to unlock the treasures of true knowledge.
PRO.1.3	Those who cling to these words will receive discipline
PRO.1.3	to demonstrate wisdom in every relationship
PRO.1.3	and to choose what is right and just and fair.
PRO.1.4	These proverbs will give you great skill
PRO.1.4	to teach the immature and make them wise,
PRO.1.4	to give youth the understanding of their design and destiny.
PRO.1.5	For the wise, these proverbs will make you even wiser,
PRO.1.5	and for those with discernment,
PRO.1.5	you will be able to acquire brilliant strategies for leadership.
PRO.1.6	These kingdom revelations will break open your understanding
PRO.1.6	to unveil the deeper meaning of parables,
PRO.1.6	poetic riddles, and epigrams,
PRO.1.6	and to unravel the words and enigmas of the wise.
PRO.1.7	How then does a man gain the essence of wisdom?
PRO.1.7	We cross the threshold of true knowledge
PRO.1.7	when we live in obedient devotion to God.
PRO.1.7	Stubborn know-it-alls will never stop to do this,
PRO.1.7	for they scorn true wisdom and knowledge.
PRO.1.8	Pay close attention, my child, to your father’s wise words
PRO.1.8	and never forget your mother’s instructions.
PRO.1.9	For their insight will bring you success,
PRO.1.9	adorning you with grace-filled thoughts
PRO.1.9	and giving you reins to guide your decisions.
PRO.1.10	When peer pressure compels you to go with the crowd
PRO.1.10	and sinners invite you to join in,
PRO.1.10	you must simply say, “No!”
PRO.1.11	When the gang says—
PRO.1.11	“We’re going to steal and kill and get away with it.
PRO.1.12	We’ll take down the rich and rob them.
PRO.1.12	We’ll swallow them up alive
PRO.1.12	and take what we want from whomever we want.
PRO.1.13	Then we’ll take their treasures and fill our homes with loot.
PRO.1.14	So come on and join us.
PRO.1.14	Take your chance with us.
PRO.1.14	We’ll divide up all we get;
PRO.1.14	we’ll each end up with big bags of cash!”—
PRO.1.15	my son, refuse to go with them and stay far away from them.
PRO.1.16	For crime is their way of life and bloodshed their specialty.
PRO.1.17	To be aware of their snare is the best way of escape.
PRO.1.18	They’ll resort to murder to steal their victim’s assets,
PRO.1.18	but eventually it will be their own lives that are ambushed.
PRO.1.19	In their ungodly disrespect for God
PRO.1.19	they bring destruction on their own lives.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom’s praises are sung in the streets
PRO.1.20	and celebrated far and wide.
PRO.1.21	Yet wisdom’s song is not always heard in the halls of higher learning.
PRO.1.21	But in the hustle and bustle of everyday life
PRO.1.21	its lyrics can always be heard above the din of the crowd.
PRO.1.21	You will hear wisdom’s warning as she preaches courageously
PRO.1.21	to those who stop to listen:
PRO.1.22	“Foolish ones, how much longer will you cling to your deception?
PRO.1.22	How much longer will you mock wisdom,
PRO.1.22	cynical scorners who fight the facts?
PRO.1.23	Come back to your senses and be restored to reality.
PRO.1.23	Don’t even think about refusing my rebuke!
PRO.1.23	Don’t you know that I’m ready
PRO.1.23	to pour out my spirit of wisdom upon you
PRO.1.23	and bring to you the revelation of my words
PRO.1.23	that will make your heart wise?
PRO.1.24	I’ve called to you over and over;
PRO.1.24	still you refuse to come to me.
PRO.1.24	I’ve pleaded with you again and again,
PRO.1.24	yet you’ve turned a deaf ear to my voice.
PRO.1.25	Because you have laughed at my counsel
PRO.1.25	and have insisted on continuing in your stubbornness,
PRO.1.26	I will laugh when your calamity comes
PRO.1.26	and will turn away from you at the time of your disaster.
PRO.1.26	Make a joke of my advice, will you?
PRO.1.26	Then I’ll make a joke out of you!
PRO.1.27	When the storm clouds of terror gather over your head,
PRO.1.27	when dread and distress consume you
PRO.1.27	and your catastrophe comes like a hurricane,
PRO.1.28	you will cry out to me, but I won’t answer.
PRO.1.28	Then it will be too late to expect my help.
PRO.1.28	When desperation drives you to search for me,
PRO.1.28	I will be nowhere to be found.
PRO.1.29	Because you have turned up your nose at me
PRO.1.29	and closed your eyes to the facts
PRO.1.29	and refused to worship me in awe—
PRO.1.30	because you scoffed at my wise counsel
PRO.1.30	and laughed at my correction—
PRO.1.31	now you will eat the bitter fruit of your own ways.
PRO.1.31	You’ve made your own bed; now lie in it!
PRO.1.31	So how do you like that?
PRO.1.32	Like an idiot you’ve turned away from me
PRO.1.32	and chosen destruction instead.
PRO.1.32	Your self-satisfied smugness will kill you.
PRO.1.33	But the one who always listens to me
PRO.1.33	will live undisturbed in a heavenly peace.
PRO.1.33	Free from fear, confident and courageous,
PRO.1.33	you will rest unafraid and sheltered from the storms of life.
PRO.2.1	My child, will you treasure my wisdom?
PRO.2.1	Then, and only then, will you acquire it.
PRO.2.1	And only if you accept my advice
PRO.2.1	and hide it within will you succeed.
PRO.2.2	So train your heart to listen when I speak
PRO.2.2	and open your spirit wide to expand your discernment—
PRO.2.2	then pass it on to your sons and daughters.
PRO.2.3	Yes, cry out for comprehension and intercede for insight.
PRO.2.4	For if you keep seeking it like a man would seek for sterling silver,
PRO.2.4	searching in hidden places for cherished treasure,
PRO.2.5	then you will discover the fear of the Lord
PRO.2.5	and find the true knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	Wisdom is a gift from a generous God,
PRO.2.6	and every word he speaks is full of revelation
PRO.2.6	and becomes a fountain of understanding within you.
PRO.2.7+PRO.2.8	For the Lord has a hidden storehouse of wisdom
PRO.2.7+PRO.2.8	made accessible to his godly lovers.
PRO.2.7+PRO.2.8	He becomes your personal bodyguard as you follow his ways,
PRO.2.7+PRO.2.8	protecting and guarding you as you choose what is right.
PRO.2.9	Then you will discover all that is just, proper, and fair,
PRO.2.9	and be empowered to make the right decisions
PRO.2.9	as you walk into your destiny.
PRO.2.10	When wisdom wins your heart and revelation breaks in,
PRO.2.10	true pleasure enters your soul.
PRO.2.11	If you choose to follow good counsel,
PRO.2.11	divine design will watch over you
PRO.2.11	and understanding will protect you
PRO.2.11	from making poor choices.
PRO.2.12	It will rescue you from evil in disguise
PRO.2.12	and from those who speak duplicities.
PRO.2.13	For they have left the highway of holiness
PRO.2.13	and walk in the ways of darkness.
PRO.2.14	They take pleasure when evil prospers
PRO.2.14	and thoroughly enjoy a lifestyle of sin.
PRO.2.15	But they’re walking on a path to nowhere,
PRO.2.15	wandering away into deeper deception.
PRO.2.16	Only wisdom can save you from the flattery
PRO.2.16	of the promiscuous woman—
PRO.2.16	she’s such a smooth-talking seductress!
PRO.2.17	She left her husband and has forgotten her wedding vows.
PRO.2.18	You’ll find her house on the road to hell,
PRO.2.19	and all the men who go through her doors
PRO.2.19	will never come back to the place they were—
PRO.2.19	they will find nothing but desolation and despair.
PRO.2.20	Follow those who follow wisdom and stay on the right path.
PRO.2.21	For all my godly lovers will enjoy life to the fullest
PRO.2.21	and will inherit their destinies.
PRO.2.22	But the treacherous ones who love darkness
PRO.2.22	will not only lose all they could have had,
PRO.2.22	they will lose even their own souls!
PRO.3.1+PRO.3.2	My child, if you truly want a long and satisfying life,
PRO.3.1+PRO.3.2	never forget the things that I’ve taught you.
PRO.3.1+PRO.3.2	Follow closely every truth that I’ve given you.
PRO.3.1+PRO.3.2	Then you will have a full, rewarding life.
PRO.3.3	Hold on to loyal love and don’t let go,
PRO.3.3	and be faithful to all that you’ve been taught.
PRO.3.3	Let your life be shaped by integrity,
PRO.3.3	with truth written upon your heart.
PRO.3.4	That’s how you will find favor and understanding
PRO.3.4	with both God and men—
PRO.3.4	you will gain the reputation of living life well.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the Lord completely,
PRO.3.5	and do not rely on your own opinions.
PRO.3.5	With all your heart rely on him to guide you,
PRO.3.5	and he will lead you in every decision you make.
PRO.3.6	Become intimate with him in whatever you do,
PRO.3.6	and he will lead you wherever you go.
PRO.3.7	Don’t think for a moment that you know it all,
PRO.3.7	for wisdom comes when you adore him with undivided devotion
PRO.3.7	and avoid everything that’s wrong.
PRO.3.8	Then you will find the healing refreshment
PRO.3.8	your body and spirit long for.
PRO.3.9	Glorify God with all your wealth,
PRO.3.9	honoring him with your very best,
PRO.3.9	with every increase that comes to you.
PRO.3.10	Then every dimension of your life will overflow with blessings
PRO.3.10	from an uncontainable source of inner joy!
PRO.3.11	My child, when the Lord God speaks to you,
PRO.3.11	never take his words lightly,
PRO.3.11	and never be upset when he corrects you.
PRO.3.12	For the Father’s discipline comes only
PRO.3.12	from his passionate love and pleasure for you.
PRO.3.12	Even when it seems like his correction is harsh,
PRO.3.12	it’s still better than any father on earth gives to his child.
PRO.3.13	Those who find true wisdom obtain the tools for understanding,
PRO.3.13	the proper way to live,
PRO.3.13	for they will have a fountain of blessing pouring into their lives.
PRO.3.13	To gain the riches of wisdom is far greater
PRO.3.13	than gaining the wealth of the world.
PRO.3.14	As wisdom increases, a great treasure is imparted,
PRO.3.14	greater than many bars of refined gold.
PRO.3.15	It is a more valuable commodity than gold and gemstones,
PRO.3.15	for there is nothing you desire that could compare to her.
PRO.3.16	Wisdom extends to you long life in one hand
PRO.3.16	and wealth and promotion in the other.
PRO.3.16	Out of her mouth flows righteousness,
PRO.3.16	and her words release both law and mercy.
PRO.3.17	The ways of wisdom are sweet,
PRO.3.17	always drawing you into the place of wholeness.
PRO.3.18	Seeking for her brings the discovery of untold blessings,
PRO.3.18	for she is the healing tree of life to those who taste her fruits.
PRO.3.19	The Lord laid the earth’s foundations with wisdom’s blueprints.
PRO.3.19	By his living-understanding all the universe came into being.
PRO.3.20	By his divine revelation he broke open
PRO.3.20	the hidden fountains of the deep,
PRO.3.20	bringing secret springs to the surface
PRO.3.20	as the mist of the night dripped down from heaven.
PRO.3.21	My child, never drift off course from these two goals for your life:
PRO.3.21	to walk in wisdom and to discover discernment.
PRO.3.21	Don’t ever forget how they empower you.
PRO.3.22	For they strengthen you inside and out
PRO.3.22	and inspire you to do what’s right;
PRO.3.22	you will be energized and refreshed by the healing they bring.
PRO.3.23	They give you living hope to guide you,
PRO.3.23	and not one of life’s tests will cause you to stumble.
PRO.3.24	You will sleep like a baby, safe and sound—
PRO.3.24	your rest will be sweet and secure.
PRO.3.25	You will not be subject to terror, for it will not terrify you.
PRO.3.25	Nor will the disrespectful be able to push you aside,
PRO.3.26	because God is your confidence in times of crisis,
PRO.3.26	keeping your heart at rest in every situation.
PRO.3.27	Why would you withhold payment on your debt
PRO.3.27	when you have the ability to pay? Just do it!
PRO.3.28	When your friend comes to ask you for a favor,
PRO.3.28	why would you say, “Perhaps tomorrow,”
PRO.3.28	when you have the money right there in your pocket?
PRO.3.28	Help him today!
PRO.3.29	Why would you hold a grudge in your heart
PRO.3.29	toward your neighbor who lives right next door?
PRO.3.30	And why would you quarrel with those
PRO.3.30	who have done nothing wrong to you?
PRO.3.30	Is that a chip on your shoulder?
PRO.3.31	Don’t act like those bullies or learn their ways.
PRO.3.32	Every violent thug is despised by the Lord,
PRO.3.32	but every tender lover finds friendship with God
PRO.3.32	and will hear his intimate secrets.
PRO.3.33	The wicked walk under God’s constant curse,
PRO.3.33	but godly lovers walk under a stream of his blessing,
PRO.3.33	for they seek to do what is right.
PRO.3.34	If you walk with the mockers you will learn to mock,
PRO.3.34	but God’s grace and favor flow to the meek.
PRO.3.35	Stubborn fools fill their lives with disgrace,
PRO.3.35	but glory and honor rest upon the wise.
PRO.4.1	Listen to my correction, my sons,
PRO.4.1	for I speak to you as your father.
PRO.4.1	Let discernment enter your heart
PRO.4.1	and you will grow wise with the understanding I impart.
PRO.4.2	My revelation-truth is a gift to you,
PRO.4.2	so remain faithful to my instruction.
PRO.4.3	For I, too, was once the delight of my father
PRO.4.3	and cherished by my mother, their beloved child.
PRO.4.4	Then my father taught me, saying,
PRO.4.4	“Never forget my words.
PRO.4.4	If you do everything that I teach you, you will reign in life.”
PRO.4.5	So make wisdom your quest—
PRO.4.5	search for the revelation of life’s meaning.
PRO.4.5	Don’t let what I say go in one ear and out the other.
PRO.4.6	Stick with wisdom and she will stick to you,
PRO.4.6	protecting you throughout your days.
PRO.4.6	She will rescue all those who passionately listen to her voice.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is the most valuable commodity—so buy it!
PRO.4.7	Revelation knowledge is what you need—so invest in it!
PRO.4.8	Wisdom will exalt you when you exalt her truth.
PRO.4.8	She will lead you to honor and favor
PRO.4.8	when you live your life by her insights.
PRO.4.9	You will be adorned with beauty and grace,
PRO.4.9	and wisdom’s glory will wrap itself around you,
PRO.4.9	making you victorious in the race.
PRO.4.10	My son, if you will take the time to stop and listen to me
PRO.4.10	and embrace what I say,
PRO.4.10	you will live a long and happy life
PRO.4.10	full of understanding in every way.
PRO.4.11	I have taken you by the hand in wisdom’s ways,
PRO.4.11	pointing you to the path of integrity.
PRO.4.12	Your progress will have no limits when you come along with me,
PRO.4.12	and you will never stumble as you walk along the way.
PRO.4.13	So receive my correction no matter how hard it is to swallow,
PRO.4.13	for wisdom will snap you back into place—
PRO.4.13	her words will be invigorating life to you.
PRO.4.14	Do not detour into darkness or even set foot on that path.
PRO.4.15	Stay away from it; don’t even go there!
PRO.4.16	For troublemakers are restless if they are not involved in evil.
PRO.4.16	They are not satisfied until they have brought someone harm.
PRO.4.17	They feed on darkness and drink
PRO.4.17	until they’re drunk on the wine of wickedness.
PRO.4.18	But the lovers of God walk on the highway of light,
PRO.4.18	and their way shines brighter and brighter
PRO.4.18	until they bring forth the perfect day.
PRO.4.19	But the wicked walk in thick darkness,
PRO.4.19	like those who travel in fog,
PRO.4.19	and yet don’t have a clue why they keep stumbling!
PRO.4.20	Listen carefully, my dear child, to everything that I teach you,
PRO.4.20	and pay attention to all that I have to say.
PRO.4.21	Fill your thoughts with my words
PRO.4.21	until they penetrate deep into your spirit.
PRO.4.22	Then, as you unwrap my words,
PRO.4.22	they will impart true life and radiant health
PRO.4.22	into the very core of your being.
PRO.4.23	So above all, guard the affections of your heart,
PRO.4.23	for they affect all that you are.
PRO.4.23	Pay attention to the welfare of your innermost being,
PRO.4.23	for from there flows the wellspring of life.
PRO.4.24	Avoid dishonest speech and pretentious words.
PRO.4.24	Be free from using perverse words no matter what!
PRO.4.25	Set your gaze on the path before you.
PRO.4.25	With fixed purpose, looking straight ahead,
PRO.4.25	.
PRO.4.26	Watch where you’re going!
PRO.4.26	Stick to the path of truth,
PRO.4.26	and the road will be safe and smooth before you.
PRO.4.27	Don’t allow yourself to be sidetracked for even a moment
PRO.4.27	or take the detour that leads to darkness.
PRO.5.1	Listen to me, my son,
PRO.5.1	for I know what I’m talking about.
PRO.5.1	Listen carefully to my advice
PRO.5.2	so that wisdom and discernment will enter your heart,
PRO.5.2	and then the words you speak will express what you’ve learned.
PRO.5.3	Remember this:
PRO.5.3	The lips of a seductress seem sweet like honey,
PRO.5.3	and her smooth words are like music in your ears.
PRO.5.4	But I promise you this:
PRO.5.4	In the end all you’ll be left with is a bitter conscience.
PRO.5.4	For the sting of your sin will pierce your soul like a sword.
PRO.5.5	She will ruin your life, drag you down to death,
PRO.5.5	and lead you straight to hell.
PRO.5.6	She has prevented many from considering the paths of life.
PRO.5.6	Yes, she will take you with her where you don’t want to go,
PRO.5.6	sliding down a slippery road
PRO.5.6	and not even realizing where the two of you will end up!
PRO.5.7	Listen to me, young men,
PRO.5.7	and don’t forget this one thing I’m telling you—
PRO.5.7	run away from her as fast as you can!
PRO.5.8	Don’t even go near the door of her house
PRO.5.8	unless you want to fall into her seduction.
PRO.5.9	In disgrace you will relinquish your honor to another,
PRO.5.9	and all your remaining years will be squandered—
PRO.5.9	given over to the cruel one.
PRO.5.10	Why would you let strangers take away your strength
PRO.5.10	while the labors of your house go to someone else?
PRO.5.11	For when you grow old you will groan in anguish and shame
PRO.5.11	as sexually transmitted diseases consume your body.
PRO.5.12	And then finally you’ll admit that you were wrong and say,
PRO.5.12	“If only I had listened to wisdom’s voice
PRO.5.12	and not stubbornly demanded my own way,
PRO.5.12	because my heart hated to be told what to do!
PRO.5.13	Why didn’t I take seriously the warning of my wise counselors?
PRO.5.13	Why was I so stupid to think that I could get away with it?
PRO.5.14	Now I’m totally disgraced and my life is ruined!
PRO.5.14	I’m paying the price—
PRO.5.14	for the people of the congregation are now my judges.”
PRO.5.15	My son, share your love with your wife alone.
PRO.5.15	Drink from her well of pleasure and from no other.
PRO.5.16	Why would you have sex with a stranger
PRO.5.16	or with anyone other than her?
PRO.5.17	Reserve this pleasure for you and her alone and not with another.
PRO.5.18	Your sex life will be blessed
PRO.5.18	as you take joy and pleasure in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	Let her breasts be your satisfaction,
PRO.5.19	and let her embrace intoxicate you at all times.
PRO.5.19	Be continually delighted and ravished with her love!
PRO.5.20	My son, why would you be exhilarated by an adulteress—
PRO.5.20	by embracing a woman who is not yours?
PRO.5.21	For God sees everything you do and his eyes are wide open
PRO.5.21	as he observes every single habit you have.
PRO.5.22	Beware that your sins don’t overtake you
PRO.5.22	and the scars of your own conscience
PRO.5.22	become the ropes that tie you up.
PRO.5.23	Those who choose wickedness die for lack of self-control,
PRO.5.23	for their foolish ways lead them astray,
PRO.5.23	carrying them away as hostages—
PRO.5.23	.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you cosign a loan for an acquaintance
PRO.6.1	and guarantee his debt,
PRO.6.1	you’ll be sorry that you ever did it!
PRO.6.2	You’ll be trapped by your promise
PRO.6.2	and legally bound by the agreement.
PRO.6.2	So listen carefully to my advice:
PRO.6.3	Quickly get out of it if you possibly can!
PRO.6.3	Swallow your pride, get over your embarrassment,
PRO.6.3	and go tell your “friend” you want your name off that contract.
PRO.6.4	Don’t put it off, and don’t rest until you get it done.
PRO.6.5	Rescue yourself from future pain
PRO.6.5	and be free from it once and for all.
PRO.6.6	When you’re feeling lazy,
PRO.6.6	come and learn a lesson from this tale of the tiny ant.
PRO.6.6	Yes, all you lazybones, come learn
PRO.6.6	from the example of the ant and enter into wisdom.
PRO.6.7	The ants have no chief, no boss, no manager—
PRO.6.7	no one has to tell them what to do.
PRO.6.8	You’ll see them working and toiling all summer long,
PRO.6.8	stockpiling their food in preparation for winter.
PRO.6.9	So wake up, sleepyhead. How long will you lie there?
PRO.6.9	When will you wake up and get out of bed?
PRO.6.10	If you keep nodding off and thinking, “I’ll do it later,”
PRO.6.10	or say to yourself, “I’ll just sit back awhile and take it easy,”
PRO.6.10	just watch how the future unfolds!
PRO.6.11	By making excuses you’ll learn what it means to go without.
PRO.6.11	Poverty will pounce on you like a bandit
PRO.6.11	and move in as your roommate for life.
PRO.6.12+PRO.6.13	Here’s another life lesson to learn
PRO.6.12+PRO.6.13	from observing the wayward and wicked man.
PRO.6.12+PRO.6.13	You can tell they are lawless.
PRO.6.12+PRO.6.13	They’re constant liars, proud deceivers,
PRO.6.12+PRO.6.13	full of clever ploys and convincing plots.
PRO.6.14	Their twisted thoughts are perverse,
PRO.6.14	always with a scheme to stir up trouble,
PRO.6.14	and sowing strife with every step they take.
PRO.6.15	But when calamity comes knocking on their door,
PRO.6.15	suddenly and without warning they’re undone—
PRO.6.15	broken to bits, shattered, with no hope of healing.
PRO.6.16	There are six evils God truly hates
PRO.6.16	and a seventh that is an abomination to him:
PRO.6.17	Putting others down while considering yourself superior,
PRO.6.17	spreading lies and rumors,
PRO.6.17	spilling the blood of the innocent,
PRO.6.18	plotting evil in your heart toward another,
PRO.6.18	gloating over doing what’s plainly wrong,
PRO.6.19	spouting lies in false testimony,
PRO.6.19	and stirring up strife 
PRO.6.19	These are entirely despicable to God!
PRO.6.20	My son, obey your father’s godly instruction
PRO.6.20	and follow your mother’s life-giving teaching.
PRO.6.21	Fill your heart with their advice
PRO.6.21	and let your life be shaped by what they’ve taught you.
PRO.6.22	Their wisdom will guide you wherever you go
PRO.6.22	and keep you from bringing harm to yourself.
PRO.6.22	Their instruction will whisper to you at every sunrise
PRO.6.22	and direct you through a brand-new day.
PRO.6.23	For truth is a bright beam of light
PRO.6.23	shining into every area of your life,
PRO.6.23	instructing and correcting you to discover the ways to godly living.
PRO.6.24+PRO.6.25	Truth will protect you from immorality
PRO.6.24+PRO.6.25	and from the promiscuity of another man’s wife.
PRO.6.24+PRO.6.25	Your heart won’t be enticed by her flatteries
PRO.6.24+PRO.6.25	or lust over her beauty—
PRO.6.24+PRO.6.25	nor will her suggestive ways conquer you.
PRO.6.26	Prostitutes reduce a man to poverty,
PRO.6.26	and the adulteress steals your soul—
PRO.6.26	she may even cost you your life!
PRO.6.27	For how can a man light his pants on fire and not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can he walk over hot coals of fire and not blister his feet?
PRO.6.29	What makes you think that you can sleep with another man’s wife
PRO.6.29	and not get caught?
PRO.6.29	Do you really think you’ll get away with it?
PRO.6.29	Don’t you know it will ruin your life?
PRO.6.30	You can almost excuse a thief if he steals to feed his own family.
PRO.6.31	But if he’s caught, he still has to pay back what he stole sevenfold;
PRO.6.31	his punishment and fine will cost him greatly.
PRO.6.32	Don’t be so stupid as to think
PRO.6.32	you can get away with your adultery.
PRO.6.32	It will destroy your life, and you’ll pay the price
PRO.6.32	for the rest of your days.
PRO.6.33	You’ll discover what humiliation, shame,
PRO.6.33	and disgrace are all about,
PRO.6.33	for no one will ever let you forget what you’ve done.
PRO.6.34	A husband’s jealousy makes a man furious;
PRO.6.34	he won’t spare you when he comes to take revenge.
PRO.6.35	Try all you want to talk your way out of it—
PRO.6.35	offer him a bribe and see if you can manipulate him
PRO.6.35	with your money.
PRO.6.35	Nothing will turn him aside
PRO.6.35	when he comes to you with vengeance in his eyes!
PRO.7.1	Stick close to my instruction, my son,
PRO.7.1	and follow all my advice.
PRO.7.2	If you do what I say you will live well.
PRO.7.2	Guard your life with my revelation-truth,
PRO.7.2	for my teaching is as precious as your eyesight.
PRO.7.3	Treasure my instructions, and cherish them within your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “I love you,”
PRO.7.4	and to understanding, “You’re my sweetheart.”
PRO.7.5	“May the two of you protect me, and may we never be apart!”
PRO.7.5	For they will keep you from the adulteress,
PRO.7.5	with her smooth words meant to seduce your heart.
PRO.7.6	Looking out the window of my house one day
PRO.7.7	I noticed among the mindless crowd
PRO.7.7	a simple, naïve young man who was about to go astray.
PRO.7.8	There he was, walking down the street.
PRO.7.8	Then he turned the corner,
PRO.7.8	going on his way as he hurried on to the house of the harlot—
PRO.7.8	the woman he had planned to meet.
PRO.7.9	There he was in the twilight as darkness fell,
PRO.7.9	convinced no one was watching
PRO.7.9	as he entered the black shadows of hell.
PRO.7.10	That’s when their rendezvous began.
PRO.7.10	A woman of the night appeared,
PRO.7.10	dressed to kill the strength of any man.
PRO.7.10	She was decked out as a harlot, pursuing her amorous plan.
PRO.7.11	Her voice was seductive, rebellious, and boisterous
PRO.7.11	as she wandered far from what’s right.
PRO.7.12	Her type can be found soliciting on street corners
PRO.7.12	on just about any night.
PRO.7.13	She wrapped her arms around the senseless young man
PRO.7.13	and held him tight—
PRO.7.13	she enticed him with kisses that seemed so right.
PRO.7.13	Then, with insolence, she whispered in his ear,
PRO.7.14	“Come with me. It’ll be all right.
PRO.7.14	I’ve got everything we need for a feast.
PRO.7.14	I’ll cook you a wonderful dinner.
PRO.7.14	So here I am—I’m all yours!
PRO.7.15	You’re the very one I’ve looked for,
PRO.7.15	the one I knew I wanted from the moment I saw you.
PRO.7.15	That’s why I’ve come out here tonight,
PRO.7.15	so I could meet a man just like you.
PRO.7.16	I’ve spread my canopy bed with coverings,
PRO.7.16	lovely multicolored Egyptian linens spread
PRO.7.16	and ready for you to lie down on.
PRO.7.17	I’ve sprinkled the sheets with intoxicating perfume
PRO.7.17	made from myrrh, aloes, and sweet cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s get comfortable and take pleasure in each other
PRO.7.18	and make love all night!
PRO.7.19	There’s no one home, for my husband’s away on business.
PRO.7.20	He left home loaded with money to spend,
PRO.7.20	so don’t worry.
PRO.7.20	He won’t be back until another month ends.”
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	He was swayed by her sophistication,
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	enticed by her longing embrace.
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	She led him down the wayward path right into sin and disgrace.
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	Quickly he went astray, with no clue
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	where he was truly headed,
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	taken like a dumb ox alongside of the butcher.
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	She was like a venomous snake coiled to strike,
PRO.7.21+PRO.7.22	so she set her fangs into him!
PRO.7.23	He’s like a man about to be executed with an arrow
PRO.7.23	right through his heart—
PRO.7.23	like a bird that flies into the net,
PRO.7.23	unaware of what’s about to happen.
PRO.7.24	So listen to me, you young men.
PRO.7.24	You’d better take my words seriously!
PRO.7.25	Control your sexual urges and guard your hearts from lust.
PRO.7.25	Don’t let your passions get out of hand
PRO.7.25	and don’t lock your eyes onto a beautiful woman.
PRO.7.25	Why would you want to even get close
PRO.7.25	to temptation and seduction,
PRO.7.25	to have an affair with her?
PRO.7.26	She has pierced the souls of multitudes of men—
PRO.7.26	many mighty ones have fallen
PRO.7.26	and have been brought down by her.
PRO.7.27	If you’re looking for the road to hell,
PRO.7.27	just go looking for her house!
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	Can’t you hear the voice of Wisdom?
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	From the top of the mountains of influence
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	she speaks into the gateways of the glorious city.
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	At the place where pathways merge,
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	at the entrance of every portal,
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	there she stands, ready to impart understanding,
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	shouting aloud to all who enter,
PRO.8.1+PRO.8.2+PRO.8.3	preaching her sermon to those who will listen.
PRO.8.4	“I’m calling to you, sons of Adam,
PRO.8.4	yes, and to you daughters as well.
PRO.8.5	Listen to me and you will be prudent and wise.
PRO.8.5	For even the foolish and feeble can receive an understanding heart
PRO.8.5	.
PRO.8.6	The meaning of my words will release within you revelation
PRO.8.6	for you to reign in life.
PRO.8.6	My lyrics will empower you to live by what is right.
PRO.8.7	For everything I say is unquestionably true,
PRO.8.7	and I refuse to endure the lies of lawlessness—
PRO.8.7	my words will never lead you astray.
PRO.8.8	All the declarations of my mouth can be trusted;
PRO.8.8	they contain no twisted logic or perversion of the truth.
PRO.8.9	All my words are clear and straightforward to everyone
PRO.8.9	who possesses spiritual understanding.
PRO.8.9	If you have an open mind, you will receive revelation-knowledge.
PRO.8.10	My wise correction is more valuable than silver or gold.
PRO.8.10	The finest gold is nothing compared to the revelation-knowledge
PRO.8.10	I can impart.”
PRO.8.11	Wisdom is so priceless that it exceeds the value of any jewel.
PRO.8.11	Nothing you could wish for can equal her.
PRO.8.12	“For I am Wisdom, and I am shrewd and intelligent.
PRO.8.12	I have at my disposal living-understanding
PRO.8.12	to devise a plan for your life.
PRO.8.13	Wisdom pours into you
PRO.8.13	when you begin to hate every form of evil in your life,
PRO.8.13	for that’s what worship and fearing God is all about.
PRO.8.13	Then you will discover
PRO.8.13	that your pompous pride and perverse speech
PRO.8.13	are the very ways of wickedness that I hate!”
PRO.8.14	“You will find true success when you find me,
PRO.8.14	for I have insight into wise plans that are designed just for you.
PRO.8.14	I hold in my hands living-understanding, courage, and strength.
PRO.8.15	I empower kings to reign and rulers to make laws that are just.
PRO.8.16	I empower princes to rise and take dominion,
PRO.8.16	and generous ones to govern the earth.
PRO.8.17	I will show my love to those who passionately love me.
PRO.8.17	For they will search and search continually until they find me.
PRO.8.18	Unending wealth and glory
PRO.8.18	come to those who discover where I dwell.
PRO.8.18	The riches of righteousness and a long, satisfying life
PRO.8.18	will be given to them.
PRO.8.19	What I impart has greater worth than gold and treasure,
PRO.8.19	and the increase I bring benefits more than a windfall of income.
PRO.8.20	I lead you into the ways of righteousness
PRO.8.20	to discover the paths of true justice.
PRO.8.21	Those who love me gain great wealth and a glorious inheritance,
PRO.8.21	and I will fill their lives with treasures.
PRO.8.22	“In the beginning I was there,
PRO.8.22	for God possessed me even before he created the universe.
PRO.8.23	From eternity past I was set in place,
PRO.8.23	before the world began.
PRO.8.23	I was anointed from the beginning.
PRO.8.24	Before the oceans depths were poured out,
PRO.8.24	and before there were any glorious fountains
PRO.8.24	overflowing with water,
PRO.8.24	I was there, dancing!
PRO.8.25	Even before one mountain had been sculpted
PRO.8.25	or one hill raised up,
PRO.8.25	I was already there, dancing!
PRO.8.26	When he created the earth, the fields,
PRO.8.26	even the first atom of dust,
PRO.8.26	I was already there.
PRO.8.27	When he hung the tapestry of the heavens
PRO.8.27	and stretched out the horizon of the earth,
PRO.8.28	when the clouds and skies were set in place
PRO.8.28	and the subterranean fountains began to flow strong,
PRO.8.28	I was already there.
PRO.8.29	when he set in place the pillars of the earth
PRO.8.29	and spoke the decrees of the seas,
PRO.8.29	commanding the waves
PRO.8.29	so that they wouldn’t overstep their boundaries,
PRO.8.30	I was there, close to the Creator’s side as his master artist.
PRO.8.30	Daily he was filled with delight in me
PRO.8.30	as I playfully rejoiced before him.
PRO.8.31	I laughed and played,
PRO.8.31	so happy with what he had made,
PRO.8.31	while finding my delight in the children of men.
PRO.8.32	“So listen, my sons and daughters, to everything I tell you,
PRO.8.32	for nothing will bring you more joy than following my ways.
PRO.8.33	Listen to my counsel,
PRO.8.33	for my instruction will enlighten you.
PRO.8.33	You’ll be wise not to ignore it.
PRO.8.34	If you wait at wisdom’s doorway,
PRO.8.34	longing to hear a word for every day,
PRO.8.34	joy will break forth within you as you listen for what I’ll say.
PRO.8.35	For the fountain of life pours into you every time that you find me,
PRO.8.35	and this is the secret of growing in the delight
PRO.8.35	and the favor of the Lord.
PRO.8.36	But those who stumble and miss me will be sorry they did!
PRO.8.36	For ignoring what I have to say will bring harm to your own soul.
PRO.8.36	Those who hate me are simply flirting with death!”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built herself a palace
PRO.9.1	upon seven pillars to keep it secure.
PRO.9.2	She has made ready a banquet feast
PRO.9.2	and the sacrifice has been killed.
PRO.9.2	She has mingled her wine, and the table’s all set.
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her maidens,
PRO.9.3	crying out from the high place,
PRO.9.3	inviting everyone to come
PRO.9.3	and eat until they’re full.
PRO.9.4	“Whoever wants to know me and receive my wisdom,
PRO.9.5	come and dine at my table and drink of my wine.
PRO.9.6	Lay aside your simple thoughts and leave your paths behind.
PRO.9.6	Agree with my ways, live in my truth,
PRO.9.6	and righteousness you will find.”
PRO.9.7	If you try to correct an arrogant cynic,
PRO.9.7	expect an angry insult in return.
PRO.9.7	And if you try to confront an evil man,
PRO.9.7	don’t be surprised if all you get is a slap in the face!
PRO.9.8	So don’t even bother to correct a mocker,
PRO.9.8	for he’ll only hate you for it.
PRO.9.8	But go ahead and correct the wise;
PRO.9.8	they’ll love you even more.
PRO.9.9	Teach a wise man what is right
PRO.9.9	and he’ll grow even wiser.
PRO.9.9	Instruct the lovers of God
PRO.9.9	and they’ll learn even more.
PRO.9.10	The starting point for acquiring wisdom
PRO.9.10	is to be consumed with awe as you worship Jehovah-God.
PRO.9.10	To receive the revelation of the Holy One,
PRO.9.10	you must come to the one who has living-understanding.
PRO.9.11	Wisdom will extend your life,
PRO.9.11	making every year more fruitful than the one before.
PRO.9.12	So it is to your advantage to be wise.
PRO.9.12	But to ignore the counsel of wisdom
PRO.9.12	is to invite trouble into your life.
PRO.9.13	There is a spirit named Foolish,
PRO.9.13	who is boisterous and brash;
PRO.9.13	she’s seductive and restless.
PRO.9.14	And there she sits at the gateway to the high places,
PRO.9.14	on her throne overlooking the city.
PRO.9.15	She preaches to all who walk by her
PRO.9.15	who are clueless as to what is happening:
PRO.9.16	“Come home with me.”
PRO.9.16	She invites those who are easily led astray, saying,
PRO.9.17	“Illicit sex is the best sex of all.
PRO.9.17	Our secret affair will be sweeter than all others.”
PRO.9.18	Little do they know when they answer her call
PRO.9.18	that she dwells among the spirits of the dead,
PRO.9.18	and all her guests soon become citizens of hell!
PRO.10.1	The wisdom of Solomon:
PRO.10.1	When wisdom comes to a son,
PRO.10.1	joy comes to a father.
PRO.10.1	When a son turns from wisdom,
PRO.10.1	a mother grieves.
PRO.10.2	Gaining wealth through dishonesty is no gain at all.
PRO.10.2	But honesty brings you a lasting happiness.
PRO.10.3	The Lord satisfies the longings of all his lovers,
PRO.10.3	but he withholds from the wicked what their souls crave.
PRO.10.4	Slackers will know what it means to be poor,
PRO.10.4	while the hard worker becomes wealthy.
PRO.10.5	Know the importance of the season you’re in
PRO.10.5	and a wise son you will be.
PRO.10.5	But what a waste when an incompetent son
PRO.10.5	sleeps through his day of opportunity!
PRO.10.6	The lover of God is enriched beyond belief,
PRO.10.6	but the evil man only curses his luck.
PRO.10.7	The reputation of the righteous
PRO.10.7	becomes a sweet memorial to him,
PRO.10.7	while the wicked life only leaves a rotten stench.
PRO.10.8	The heart of the wise will easily accept instruction.
PRO.10.8	But those who do all the talking
PRO.10.8	are too busy to listen and learn.
PRO.10.8	They’ll just keep stumbling ahead
PRO.10.8	into the mess they created.
PRO.10.9	The one who walks in integrity
PRO.10.9	will experience a fearless confidence in life,
PRO.10.9	but the one who is devious
PRO.10.9	will eventually be exposed.
PRO.10.10	The troublemaker always has a clever plan
PRO.10.10	and won’t look you in the eye,
PRO.10.10	but the one who speaks correction honestly
PRO.10.10	can be trusted to make peace.
PRO.10.11	The teachings of the lovers of God are like
PRO.10.11	living truth flowing from the fountain of life,
PRO.10.11	but the words of the wicked
PRO.10.11	hide an ulterior motive.
PRO.10.12	Hatred keeps old quarrels alive,
PRO.10.12	but love draws a veil over every insult
PRO.10.12	and finds a way to make sin disappear.
PRO.10.13	Words of wisdom flow from the one with true discernment.
PRO.10.13	But to the heartless, words of wisdom
PRO.10.13	become like rods beating their backside.
PRO.10.14	Wise men don’t divulge all that they know,
PRO.10.14	but chattering fools blurt out words
PRO.10.14	that bring them to the brink of ruin.
PRO.10.15	A rich man’s wealth becomes like a citadel of strength,
PRO.10.15	but the poverty of the poor leaves their security in shambles.
PRO.10.16	The lovers of God earn their wages for a life of righteousness,
PRO.10.16	but the wages of the wicked are squandered on a life of sin.
PRO.10.17	If you readily receive correction,
PRO.10.17	you are walking on the path to life.
PRO.10.17	But if you reject rebuke,
PRO.10.17	you’re guaranteed to go astray.
PRO.10.18	The one who hides his hatred while pretending to be your friend
PRO.10.18	is nothing but a liar.
PRO.10.18	But the one who slanders you behind your back
PRO.10.18	proves that he’s a fool, never to be trusted.
PRO.10.19	If you keep talking, it won’t be long
PRO.10.19	before you’re saying something really wrong.
PRO.10.19	Prove you’re wise from the very start—
PRO.10.19	just bite your tongue and be strong!
PRO.10.20	The teachings of the godly ones are like pure silver,
PRO.10.20	bringing words of redemption to others,
PRO.10.20	but the heart of the wicked is corrupt.
PRO.10.21	The lovers of God feed many with their teachings,
PRO.10.21	but the foolish ones starve themselves
PRO.10.21	for lack of an understanding heart.
PRO.10.22	True enrichment comes from the blessing of the Lord,
PRO.10.22	with rest and contentment in knowing
PRO.10.22	that it all comes from him.
PRO.10.23	The fool finds his fun in doing wrong,
PRO.10.23	but the wise delight in having discernment.
PRO.10.24	The lawless are haunted by their fears
PRO.10.24	and what they dread will come upon them,
PRO.10.24	but the longings of the lovers of God will all be fulfilled.
PRO.10.25	The wicked are blown away by every stormy wind.
PRO.10.25	But when a catastrophe comes,
PRO.10.25	the lovers of God have a secure anchor.
PRO.10.26	To trust a lazy person to get a job done
PRO.10.26	will be as irritating as smoke in your eyes—
PRO.10.26	as enjoyable as a toothache!
PRO.10.27	Living in the worship and awe of God
PRO.10.27	will bring you many years of contented living.
PRO.10.27	So how could the wicked ever expect to have a long, happy life?
PRO.10.28	Lovers of God have a joyful feast of gladness,
PRO.10.28	but the ungodly see their hopes vanish right before their eyes.
PRO.10.29	The beautiful ways of God are a safe resting place
PRO.10.29	for those who have integrity.
PRO.10.29	But to those who work wickedness
PRO.10.29	the ways of God spell doom.
PRO.10.30	God’s lover can never be greatly shaken.
PRO.10.30	But the wicked will never inherit
PRO.10.30	the covenant blessings.
PRO.10.31	The teachings of the righteous are loaded with wisdom,
PRO.10.31	but the words of the evil are crooked and perverse.
PRO.10.32	Words that bring delight pour from the lips of the godly,
PRO.10.32	but the words of the wicked are duplicitous.
PRO.11.1	To set high standards for someone else,
PRO.11.1	and then not live up to them yourself,
PRO.11.1	is something that God truly hates.
PRO.11.1	But it pleases him when we apply the right standards
PRO.11.1	of measurement.
PRO.11.2	When you act with presumption,
PRO.11.2	convinced that you’re right,
PRO.11.2	don’t be surprised if you fall flat on your face!
PRO.11.2	But walking in humility helps you to make wise decisions.
PRO.11.3	Integrity will lead you to success and happiness,
PRO.11.3	but treachery will destroy your dreams.
PRO.11.4	When Judgment Day comes,
PRO.11.4	all the wealth of the world won’t help you one bit.
PRO.11.4	So you’d better be rich in righteousness,
PRO.11.4	for that’s the only thing that can save you in death.
PRO.11.5	Those with good character walk on a smooth path,
PRO.11.5	with no detour or deviation.
PRO.11.5	But the wicked keep falling because of their own wickedness.
PRO.11.6	Integrity will keep a good man from falling.
PRO.11.6	But the unbeliever is trapped,
PRO.11.6	held captive to his sinful desires.
PRO.11.7	When an evil man dies, all hope is lost,
PRO.11.7	for his misplaced confidence goes in the coffin
PRO.11.7	and gets buried along with him.
PRO.11.8	Lovers of God are snatched away from trouble,
PRO.11.8	and the wicked show up in their place.
PRO.11.9	The teachings of hypocrites can destroy you,
PRO.11.9	but revelation knowledge will rescue the righteous.
PRO.11.10	The blessing that rests on the righteous
PRO.11.10	releases strength and favor to the entire city,
PRO.11.10	but shouts of joy will be heard when the wicked one dies.
PRO.11.11	The blessing of favor resting upon the righteous
PRO.11.11	influences a city to lift it higher,
PRO.11.11	but wicked leaders tear it apart by their words.
PRO.11.12	To quarrel with a neighbor is senseless.
PRO.11.12	Bite your tongue; be wise and keep quiet!
PRO.11.13	You can’t trust gossipers with a secret;
PRO.11.13	they’ll just go blab it all.
PRO.11.13	Put your confidence instead in a trusted friend,
PRO.11.13	for he will be faithful to keep it in confidence.
PRO.11.14	People lose their way without wise leadership,
PRO.11.14	but a nation succeeds and stands in victory
PRO.11.14	when it has many good counselors to guide it.
PRO.11.15	The evil man will do harm when confronted by a righteous man,
PRO.11.15	because he hates those who await good news.
PRO.11.16	A gracious, generous woman
PRO.11.16	will be honored with a splendid reputation,
PRO.11.16	but the woman who hates the truth
PRO.11.16	lives surrounded with disgrace and by men
PRO.11.16	who are cutthroats, only greedy for money.
PRO.11.17	A man of kindness attracts favor,
PRO.11.17	while a cruel man attracts nothing but trouble.
PRO.11.18	Evil people may get a short-term gain,
PRO.11.18	but to sow seeds of righteousness
PRO.11.18	will bring a true and lasting reward.
PRO.11.19	A son of righteousness experiences the abundant life,
PRO.11.19	but the one who pursues evil hurries to his own death.
PRO.11.20	The Lord can’t stand the stubborn heart bent toward evil,
PRO.11.20	but he treasures those whose ways are pure.
PRO.11.21	Assault your neighbor and you will certainly be punished,
PRO.11.21	but God will rescue the children of the godly.
PRO.11.22	A beautiful woman who abandons good morals
PRO.11.22	is like a fine gold ring dangling from a pig’s snout.
PRO.11.23	True lovers of God are filled with longings
PRO.11.23	for what is pleasing and good,
PRO.11.23	but the wicked can only expect doom.
PRO.11.24	Generosity brings prosperity,
PRO.11.24	but withholding from charity brings poverty.
PRO.11.25	Those who live to bless others
PRO.11.25	will have blessings heaped upon them,
PRO.11.25	and the one who pours out his life to pour out blessings
PRO.11.25	will be saturated with favor.
PRO.11.26	People will curse the businessman with no ethics,
PRO.11.26	but the one with a social conscience receives praise from all.
PRO.11.27	Living your life seeking what is good for others brings untold favor,
PRO.11.27	but those who wish evil for others will find it coming back on them.
PRO.11.28	Keep trusting in your riches and down you’ll go!
PRO.11.28	But the lovers of God rise up like flowers in the spring.
PRO.11.29	The fool who brings trouble to his own family
PRO.11.29	will be cut out of the will,
PRO.11.29	and the family servant will do better than he.
PRO.11.30	But a life lived loving God bears lasting fruit,
PRO.11.30	for the one who is truly wise wins souls.
PRO.11.31	If the righteous are barely saved,
PRO.11.31	what’s in store for all the wicked?
PRO.12.1	To learn the truth you must long to be teachable,
PRO.12.1	or you can despise correction and remain ignorant.
PRO.12.2	If your heart is right, favor flows from the Lord,
PRO.12.2	but a devious heart invites his condemnation.
PRO.12.3	You can’t expect success by doing what’s wrong.
PRO.12.3	But the lives of his lovers are deeply rooted and firmly planted.
PRO.12.4	The integrity and strength of a virtuous wife
PRO.12.4	transforms her husband into an honored king.
PRO.12.4	But the wife who disgraces her husband
PRO.12.4	weakens the strength of his identity.
PRO.12.5	The lovers of God are filled with good ideas
PRO.12.5	that are noble and pure,
PRO.12.5	but the schemes of the sinner
PRO.12.5	are crammed with nothing but lies.
PRO.12.6	The wicked use their words to ambush and accuse,
PRO.12.6	but the lovers of God speak to defend and protect.
PRO.12.7	The wicked are taken out, gone for good,
PRO.12.7	but the godly families shall live on.
PRO.12.8	Everyone admires a man of principles,
PRO.12.8	but the one with a corrupt heart is despised.
PRO.12.9	Just be who you are and work hard for a living,
PRO.12.9	for that’s better than pretending to be important
PRO.12.9	and starving to death.
PRO.12.10	A good man takes care of the needs of his pets,
PRO.12.10	while even the kindest acts of a wicked man are still cruel.
PRO.12.11	Work hard at your job and you’ll have what you need.
PRO.12.11	Following a get-rich-quick scheme is nothing but a fantasy.
PRO.12.12	The cravings of the wicked are only for what is evil,
PRO.12.12	but righteousness is the core motivation for the lovers of God,
PRO.12.12	and it keeps them content and flourishing.
PRO.12.13	The wicked will get trapped by their words
PRO.12.13	of gossip, slander, and lies.
PRO.12.13	But for the righteous, honesty is its own defense.
PRO.12.14	For there is great satisfaction in speaking the truth,
PRO.12.14	and hard work brings blessings back to you.
PRO.12.15	A fool is in love with his own opinion,
PRO.12.15	but wisdom means being teachable.
PRO.12.16	If you shrug off an insult and refuse to take offense,
PRO.12.16	you demonstrate discretion indeed.
PRO.12.16	But the fool has a short fuse
PRO.12.16	and will immediately let you know when he’s offended.
PRO.12.17	Truthfulness marks the righteous,
PRO.12.17	but the habitual liar can never be trusted.
PRO.12.18	Reckless words are like the thrusts of a sword,
PRO.12.18	cutting remarks meant to stab and to hurt.
PRO.12.18	But the words of the wise soothe and heal.
PRO.12.19	Truthful words will stand the test of time,
PRO.12.19	but one day every lie will be seen for what it is.
PRO.12.20	Deception fills the hearts of those who plot harm,
PRO.12.20	but those who plan for peace are filled with joy.
PRO.12.21	Calamity is not allowed to overwhelm the righteous,
PRO.12.21	but there’s nothing but trouble waiting for the wicked.
PRO.12.22	Live in the truth and keep your promises,
PRO.12.22	and the Lord will keep delighting in you,
PRO.12.22	but he detests a liar.
PRO.12.23	Those who possess wisdom don’t feel the need
PRO.12.23	to impress others with what they know,
PRO.12.23	but foolish ones make sure their ignorance is on display.
PRO.12.24	If you want to reign in life,
PRO.12.24	don’t sit on your hands.
PRO.12.24	Instead work hard at doing what’s right,
PRO.12.24	for the slacker will end up working to make someone else succeed.
PRO.12.25	Anxious fear brings depression,
PRO.12.25	but a life-giving word of encouragement
PRO.12.25	can do wonders to restore joy to the heart.
PRO.12.26	Lovers of God give good advice to their friends,
PRO.12.26	but the counsel of the wicked will lead them astray.
PRO.12.27	A passive person won’t even complete a project,
PRO.12.27	but a passionate person makes good use
PRO.12.27	of his time, wealth, and energy.
PRO.12.28	Abundant life is discovered by walking in righteousness,
PRO.12.28	but holding on to your anger leads to death.
PRO.13.1	A wise son or daughter desires a father’s discipline,
PRO.13.1	but the know-it-all never listens to correction.
PRO.13.2	The words of the wise are kind and easy to swallow,
PRO.13.2	but the unbeliever just wants to pick a fight and argue.
PRO.13.3	Guard your words and you’ll guard your life,
PRO.13.3	but if you don’t control your tongue,
PRO.13.3	it will ruin everything.
PRO.13.4	The slacker wants it all and ends up with nothing,
PRO.13.4	but the hard worker ends up with all that he longed for.
PRO.13.5	Lovers of God hate what is phony and false,
PRO.13.5	but the wicked are full of shame and behave shamefully.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness is like a shield of protection,
PRO.13.6	guarding those who keep their integrity,
PRO.13.6	but sin is the downfall of the wicked.
PRO.13.7	One pretends to be rich but is poor.
PRO.13.7	Another pretends to be poor but is quite rich.
PRO.13.8	The self-assurance of the rich is their money,
PRO.13.8	but people don’t kidnap and extort the poor!
PRO.13.9	The virtues of God’s lovers shine brightly in the darkness,
PRO.13.9	but the flickering lamp of the ungodly will be extinguished.
PRO.13.10	Wisdom opens your heart to receive wise counsel,
PRO.13.10	but pride closes your ears to advice
PRO.13.10	and gives birth to only quarrels and strife.
PRO.13.11	Wealth quickly gained is quickly wasted—
PRO.13.11	easy come, easy go!
PRO.13.11	But if you gradually gain wealth,
PRO.13.11	you will watch it grow.
PRO.13.12	When hope’s dream seems to drag on and on,
PRO.13.12	the delay can be depressing.
PRO.13.12	But when at last your dream comes true,
PRO.13.12	life’s sweetness will satisfy your soul.
PRO.13.13	Despise the word, will you?
PRO.13.13	Then you’ll pay the price and it won’t be pretty!
PRO.13.13	But the one who honors the Father’s holy instructions
PRO.13.13	will be rewarded.
PRO.13.14	When the lovers of God teach you truth,
PRO.13.14	a fountain of life opens up within you,
PRO.13.14	and their wise instruction will deliver you from the ways of death.
PRO.13.15	Everyone admires a wise, sensible person,
PRO.13.15	but the treacherous walk on the path of ruin.
PRO.13.16	Everything a wise and shrewd man does
PRO.13.16	comes from a source of revelation-knowledge,
PRO.13.16	but the behavior of a fool puts foolishness on parade!
PRO.13.17	An undependable messenger causes a lot of trouble,
PRO.13.17	but the trustworthy and wise messengers
PRO.13.17	release healing wherever they go.
PRO.13.18	Poverty and disgrace come to the one
PRO.13.18	who refuses to hear criticism.
PRO.13.18	But the one who is easy to correct is on the path of honor.
PRO.13.19	When God fulfills your longings,
PRO.13.19	sweetness fills your soul.
PRO.13.19	But the wicked refuse to turn from darkness
PRO.13.19	.
PRO.13.20	If you want to grow in wisdom,
PRO.13.20	spend time with the wise.
PRO.13.20	Walk with the wicked
PRO.13.20	and you’ll eventually become just like them.
PRO.13.21	Calamity chases the sin-chaser,
PRO.13.21	but prosperity pursues the God-lover.
PRO.13.22	The benevolent man leaves an inheritance
PRO.13.22	that endures to his children’s children,
PRO.13.22	but the wealth of the wicked is treasured up for the righteous.
PRO.13.23	The lovers of God will live a long life and get to enjoy their wealth,
PRO.13.23	but the ungodly will suddenly perish.
PRO.13.24	If you withhold correction and punishment from your children,
PRO.13.24	you demonstrate a lack of true love.
PRO.13.24	So prove your love and be prompt to punish them.
PRO.13.25	The lovers of God will have more than enough,
PRO.13.25	but the wicked will always lack what they crave.
PRO.14.1	Every wise woman encourages and builds up her family,
PRO.14.1	but a foolish woman over time will tear it down by her own actions.
PRO.14.2	Lovers of truth follow the right path
PRO.14.2	because of their wonderment and worship of God.
PRO.14.2	But the devious display their disdain for him.
PRO.14.3	The words of a proud fool will all come back to haunt him.
PRO.14.3	But the words of the wise
PRO.14.3	will become a shield of protection around them.
PRO.14.4	The only clean stable is an empty stable.
PRO.14.4	So if you want the work of an ox and to enjoy an abundant harvest,
PRO.14.4	you’ll have a mess or two to clean up!
PRO.14.5	An honest witness will never lie,
PRO.14.5	but a deceitful witness lies with every breath.
PRO.14.6	The intellectually arrogant seek for wisdom,
PRO.14.6	but they never seem to discover
PRO.14.6	what they claim they’re looking for.
PRO.14.6	For revelation-knowledge flows to the one
PRO.14.6	who hungers for understanding.
PRO.14.7	The words of the wise are like weapons of knowledge.
PRO.14.7	If you need wise counsel, stay away from the fool.
PRO.14.8	For the wisdom of the wise will keep life on the right track,
PRO.14.8	while the fool only deceives himself
PRO.14.8	and refuses to face reality.
PRO.14.9	Fools mock the need for repentance,
PRO.14.9	while the favor of God rests upon all his lovers.
PRO.14.10	Don’t expect anyone else to fully understand
PRO.14.10	both the bitterness and the joys
PRO.14.10	of all you experience in your life.
PRO.14.11	The household of the wicked is soon torn apart,
PRO.14.11	while the family of the righteous flourishes.
PRO.14.12	You can rationalize it all you want
PRO.14.12	and justify the path of error you have chosen,
PRO.14.12	but you’ll find out in the end that you took the road to destruction.
PRO.14.13	Superficial laughter can hide a heavy heart,
PRO.14.13	but when the laughter ends, the pain resurfaces.
PRO.14.14	Those who turn from the truth get what they deserve,
PRO.14.14	but a good person receives a sweet reward.
PRO.14.15	A gullible person will believe anything,
PRO.14.15	but a sensible person will confirm the facts.
PRO.14.16	A wise person is careful in all things and turns quickly from evil,
PRO.14.16	while the impetuous fool moves ahead with overconfidence.
PRO.14.17	An impulsive person has a short fuse and can ruin everything,
PRO.14.17	but the wise show self-control.
PRO.14.18	The naïve demonstrate a lack of wisdom,
PRO.14.18	but the lovers of wisdom are crowned with revelation-knowledge.
PRO.14.19	Evil ones will pay tribute to good people
PRO.14.19	and eventually come to be servants of the godly.
PRO.14.20	The poor are disliked even by their neighbors,
PRO.14.20	but everyone wants to get close to the wealthy.
PRO.14.21	It’s a sin to despise one who is less fortunate than you,
PRO.14.21	but when you are kind to the poor,
PRO.14.21	you will prosper and be blessed.
PRO.14.22	Haven’t you noticed how evil schemers always wander astray?
PRO.14.22	But kindness and truth come to those
PRO.14.22	who make plans to be pure in all their ways.
PRO.14.23	If you work hard at what you do,
PRO.14.23	great abundance will come to you.
PRO.14.23	But merely talking about getting rich
PRO.14.23	while living to only pursue your pleasures
PRO.14.23	brings you face-to-face with poverty.
PRO.14.24	The true net worth of the wise is the wealth that wisdom imparts.
PRO.14.24	But the way of life for the fool is his foolishness.
PRO.14.25	Speak the truth and you’ll save souls,
PRO.14.25	but in the spreading of lies treachery thrives.
PRO.14.26	Confidence and strength flood the hearts
PRO.14.26	of the lovers of God who live in awe of him,
PRO.14.26	and their devotion provides their children
PRO.14.26	with a place of shelter and security.
PRO.14.27	To worship God in wonder and awe
PRO.14.27	opens a fountain of life within you,
PRO.14.27	empowering you to escape death’s domain.
PRO.14.28	A king glories in the number of his loyal followers,
PRO.14.28	but a dwindling population spells ruin for any leader.
PRO.14.29	When your heart overflows with understanding
PRO.14.29	you’ll be very slow to get angry.
PRO.14.29	But if you have a quick temper,
PRO.14.29	your impatience will be quickly seen by all.
PRO.14.30	A tender, tranquil heart will make you healthy,
PRO.14.30	but jealousy can make you sick.
PRO.14.31	Insult your Creator, will you?
PRO.14.31	That’s exactly what you do
PRO.14.31	every time that you oppress the powerless!
PRO.14.31	Showing kindness to the poor is equal to honoring your maker.
PRO.14.32	The wicked are crushed by every calamity,
PRO.14.32	but the lovers of God find a strong hope
PRO.14.32	even in the time of death.
PRO.14.33	Wisdom soothes the heart of the one with living-understanding,
PRO.14.33	but the heart of the fool just stockpiles stupidity.
PRO.14.34	A nation is exalted by the righteousness of its people,
PRO.14.34	but sin heaps disgrace upon the land.
PRO.14.35	A wise and faithful servant receives promotion from the king,
PRO.14.35	but the one who acts disgracefully
PRO.14.35	gets to taste the anger of the king.
PRO.15.1	Respond gently when you are confronted
PRO.15.1	and you’ll defuse the rage of another.
PRO.15.1	Responding with sharp, cutting words will only make it worse.
PRO.15.1	Don’t you know that being angry
PRO.15.1	can ruin the testimony of even the wisest of men?
PRO.15.2	When wisdom speaks, understanding becomes attractive.
PRO.15.2	But the words of the fool make their ignorance look laughable.
PRO.15.3	The eyes of the Lord are everywhere
PRO.15.3	and he takes note of everything that happens.
PRO.15.3	He watches over his lovers,
PRO.15.3	and he also sees the wickedness of the wicked.
PRO.15.4	When you speak healing words,
PRO.15.4	you offer others fruit from the tree of life.
PRO.15.4	But unhealthy, negative words do nothing but crush their hopes.
PRO.15.5	You’re stupid to mock the instruction of a father,
PRO.15.5	but welcoming correction will make you brilliant.
PRO.15.6	There is power in the house of the righteous,
PRO.15.6	but the house of the wicked is filled with trouble,
PRO.15.6	no matter how much money they have.
PRO.15.7	When wisdom speaks, revelation-knowledge is released,
PRO.15.7	but finding true wisdom in the word of a fool is futile.
PRO.15.8	It is despicable to the Lord
PRO.15.8	when people use the worship of the Almighty
PRO.15.8	as a cloak for their sin,
PRO.15.8	but every prayer of his godly lovers is pleasing to his heart.
PRO.15.9	The Lord detests the lifestyle of the wicked,
PRO.15.9	but he loves those who pursue purity.
PRO.15.10	Severe punishment awaits the one
PRO.15.10	who turns away from the truth,
PRO.15.10	and those who rebel against correction will die.
PRO.15.11	Even hell itself holds no secrets from the Lord God,
PRO.15.11	for all is exposed before his eyes,
PRO.15.11	and so much more the heart of every human being.
PRO.15.12	The know-it-all never esteems the one who tries to correct him.
PRO.15.12	He refuses to seek good advice from the wise.
PRO.15.13	A cheerful heart puts a smile on your face,
PRO.15.13	but a broken heart leads to depression.
PRO.15.14	Lovers of God hunger after truth,
PRO.15.14	but those without understanding
PRO.15.14	feast on foolishness and don’t even realize it.
PRO.15.15	Everything seems to go wrong
PRO.15.15	when you feel weak and depressed.
PRO.15.15	But when you choose to be cheerful,
PRO.15.15	every day will bring you more and more joy and fullness.
PRO.15.16	It’s much better to live simply,
PRO.15.16	surrounded in holy awe and worship of God,
PRO.15.16	than to have great wealth with a home full of trouble.
PRO.15.17	It’s much better to have a kind, loving family, even with little,
PRO.15.17	than to have great wealth
PRO.15.17	with nothing but hatred and strife all around you.
PRO.15.18	A touchy, hot-tempered man picks a fight,
PRO.15.18	but the calm, patient man knows how to silence strife.
PRO.15.19	Nothing seems to work right for the lazy man,
PRO.15.19	but life seems smooth and easy when your heart is virtuous.
PRO.15.20	When a son learns wisdom,
PRO.15.20	a father’s heart is glad.
PRO.15.20	But the man who shames his mother is a foolish son.
PRO.15.21	The senseless fool treats life like a joke,
PRO.15.21	but the one with living-understanding makes good choices.
PRO.15.22	Your plans will fall apart right in front of you
PRO.15.22	if you fail to get good advice.
PRO.15.22	But if you first seek out multiple counselors,
PRO.15.22	you’ll watch your plans succeed.
PRO.15.23	Everyone enjoys giving great advice.
PRO.15.23	But how delightful it is to say the right thing at the right time!
PRO.15.24	The life path of the prudent lifts them progressively heavenward,
PRO.15.24	delivering them from the death spiral
PRO.15.24	that keeps tugging them downward.
PRO.15.25	The Lord champions the widow’s cause,
PRO.15.25	but watch him as he smashes down the houses of the haughty!
PRO.15.26	The Lord detests wicked ways of thinking,
PRO.15.26	but he enjoys lovely and delightful words.
PRO.15.27	The one who puts earning money above his family
PRO.15.27	will have trouble at home,
PRO.15.27	but those who refuse to exploit others
PRO.15.27	will live 
PRO.15.28	Lovers of God think before they speak,
PRO.15.28	but the careless blurt out wicked words meant to cause harm.
PRO.15.29	The Lord doesn’t respond to the wicked,
PRO.15.29	but he’s moved to answer the prayers of his godly lovers.
PRO.15.30	Eyes that focus on what is beautiful bring joy to the heart,
PRO.15.30	and hearing a good report
PRO.15.30	refreshes and strengthens the inner being.
PRO.15.31	Accepting constructive criticism
PRO.15.31	opens your heart to the path of life,
PRO.15.31	making you right at home among the wise.
PRO.15.32	Refusing constructive criticism shows
PRO.15.32	you have no interest in improving your life,
PRO.15.32	for revelation-insight only comes as you accept correction
PRO.15.32	and the wisdom that it brings.
PRO.15.33	The source of revelation-knowledge is found
PRO.15.33	as you fall down in surrender before the Lord.
PRO.15.33	Don’t expect to see Shekinah glory
PRO.15.33	until the Lord sees your sincere humility.
PRO.16.1	Go ahead and make all the plans you want,
PRO.16.1	but it’s the Lord who will ultimately direct your steps.
PRO.16.2	We are all in love with our own opinions,
PRO.16.2	convinced they’re correct.
PRO.16.2	But the Lord is in the midst of us,
PRO.16.2	testing and probing our every motive.
PRO.16.3	Before you do anything,
PRO.16.3	put your trust totally in God and not in yourself.
PRO.16.3	Then every plan you make will succeed.
PRO.16.4	The Lord works everything together to accomplish his purpose.
PRO.16.4	Even the wicked are included in his plans—
PRO.16.4	he sets them aside for the day of disaster.
PRO.16.5	Exalting yourself is disgusting to the Lord,
PRO.16.5	for pride attracts his punishment—
PRO.16.5	and you can count on that!
PRO.16.6	You can avoid evil through surrendered worship
PRO.16.6	and the fear of God,
PRO.16.6	for the power of his faithful love
PRO.16.6	removes sin’s guilt and grip over you.
PRO.16.7	When the Lord is pleased with the decisions you’ve made,
PRO.16.7	he activates grace to turn enemies into friends.
PRO.16.8	It is better to have little with a heart that loves justice
PRO.16.8	than to be rich and not have God on your side.
PRO.16.9	Within your heart you can make plans for your future,
PRO.16.9	but the Lord chooses the steps you take to get there.
PRO.16.10	A king speaks the revelation of truth,
PRO.16.10	so he must be extraordinarily careful in the decrees that he makes.
PRO.16.11	The Lord expects you to be fair in every business deal,
PRO.16.11	for he is the one who sets the standards for righteousness.
PRO.16.12	Kings and leaders despise wrongdoing,
PRO.16.12	for the true authority to rule and reign
PRO.16.12	is built on a foundation of righteousness.
PRO.16.13	Kings and leaders love to hear godly counsel,
PRO.16.13	and they love those who tell them the truth.
PRO.16.14	The anger of a king releases the messenger of death,
PRO.16.14	but a wise person will know how to pacify his wrath.
PRO.16.15	Life-giving light streams from the presence of a king,
PRO.16.15	and his favor is showered upon those who please him.
PRO.16.16	Everyone wants gold, but wisdom’s worth is far greater.
PRO.16.16	Silver is sought after,
PRO.16.16	but a heart of understanding yields a greater return.
PRO.16.17	Repenting from evil places you on the highway of holiness.
PRO.16.17	Protect purity and you protect your life.
PRO.16.18	Your boast becomes a prophecy of a future failure.
PRO.16.18	The higher you lift up yourself in pride,
PRO.16.18	the harder you’ll fall in disgrace.
PRO.16.19	It’s better to be meek and lowly and live among the poor
PRO.16.19	than to live high and mighty among the rich and famous.
PRO.16.20	One skilled in business discovers prosperity,
PRO.16.20	but the one who trusts in God is blessed beyond belief!
PRO.16.21	The one with a wise heart is called “discerning,”
PRO.16.21	and speaking sweetly to others
PRO.16.21	makes your teaching even more convincing.
PRO.16.22	Wisdom is a deep well of understanding
PRO.16.22	opened up within you as a fountain of life for others,
PRO.16.22	but it’s senseless to try to instruct a fool.
PRO.16.23	Winsome words pour from a heart of wisdom,
PRO.16.23	adding value to all you teach.
PRO.16.24	Nothing is more appealing
PRO.16.24	than speaking beautiful, life-giving words.
PRO.16.24	For they release sweetness to our souls
PRO.16.24	and inner healing to our spirits.
PRO.16.25	Before every person there is a path
PRO.16.25	that seems like the right one to take,
PRO.16.25	but it leads straight to hell!
PRO.16.26	Life motivation comes from the deep longings of the heart,
PRO.16.26	and the passion to see them fulfilled urges you onward.
PRO.16.27	A wicked scoundrel wants to dig up dirt on others,
PRO.16.27	only to spread slander and shred their reputation.
PRO.16.28	A twisted person spreads rumors;
PRO.16.28	a whispering gossip ruins good friendships.
PRO.16.29	A vicious criminal can be persuasive,
PRO.16.29	enticing others to join him as partners in crime,
PRO.16.29	but he leads them all down a despicable path.
PRO.16.30	It’s easy to tell when a wicked man
PRO.16.30	is hatching some crooked scheme—
PRO.16.30	it’s written all over his face.
PRO.16.30	His looks betray him as he gives birth to his sin.
PRO.16.31	Old age with wisdom will crown you with dignity and honor,
PRO.16.31	for it takes a lifetime of righteousness to acquire it.
PRO.16.32	Do you want to be a mighty warrior?
PRO.16.32	It’s better to be known as one who is patient and slow to anger.
PRO.16.32	Do you want to conquer a city?
PRO.16.32	Rule over your temper before you attempt to rule a city.
PRO.16.33	We may toss the coin and roll the dice,
PRO.16.33	but God’s will is greater than luck.
PRO.17.1	A simple, humble life with peace and quiet
PRO.17.1	is far better than an opulent lifestyle with nothing
PRO.17.1	but quarrels and strife at home.
PRO.17.2	A wise, intelligent servant will be honored above a shameful son.
PRO.17.2	He’ll even end up having a portion left to him in his master’s will.
PRO.17.3	In the same way that gold and silver are refined by fire,
PRO.17.3	the Lord purifies your heart by the tests and trials of life.
PRO.17.4	Those eager to embrace evil listen to slander,
PRO.17.4	for a liar loves to listen to lies.
PRO.17.5	Mock the poor, will you?
PRO.17.5	You insult your Creator every time you do!
PRO.17.5	If you make fun of others’ misfortune,
PRO.17.5	you’d better watch out—your punishment is on its way.
PRO.17.6	Grandparents have the crowning glory of life:
PRO.17.6	grandchildren!
PRO.17.6	And it’s only proper for children to take pride in their parents.
PRO.17.7	It is not proper for a leader to lie and deceive,
PRO.17.7	and don’t expect excellent words to be spoken by a fool.
PRO.17.8	Wise instruction is like a costly gem.
PRO.17.8	It turns the impossible into success.
PRO.17.9	Love overlooks the mistakes of others,
PRO.17.9	but dwelling on the failures of others devastates friendships.
PRO.17.10	One word of correction breaks open a teachable heart,
PRO.17.10	but a fool can be corrected a hundred times
PRO.17.10	and still not know what hit him.
PRO.17.11	Rebellion thrives in an evil man,
PRO.17.11	so a messenger of vengeance will be sent to punish him.
PRO.17.12	It’s safer to meet a grizzly bear robbed of her cubs
PRO.17.12	than to confront a reckless fool.
PRO.17.13	The one who returns evil for good
PRO.17.13	can expect to be treated the same way for the rest of his life.
PRO.17.14	Don’t be one who is quick to quarrel,
PRO.17.14	for an argument is hard to stop,
PRO.17.14	and you never know how it will end,
PRO.17.14	so don’t even start down that road!
PRO.17.15	There is nothing God hates more
PRO.17.15	than condemning the one who is innocent
PRO.17.15	and acquitting the one who is guilty.
PRO.17.16	Why pay tuition to educate a fool?
PRO.17.16	For he has no intention of acquiring true wisdom.
PRO.17.17	A dear friend will love you no matter what,
PRO.17.17	and a family sticks together through all kinds of trouble.
PRO.17.18	It’s stupid to run up bills you’ll never be able to pay
PRO.17.18	or to cosign for the loan of your friend.
PRO.17.18	 and don’t do either one.
PRO.17.19	If you love to argue,
PRO.17.19	then you must be in love with sin.
PRO.17.19	For the one who loves to boast is only asking for trouble.
PRO.17.20	The one with a perverse heart never has anything good to say,
PRO.17.20	and the chronic liar tumbles into constant trouble.
PRO.17.21	Parents of a numskull will have many sorrows,
PRO.17.21	for there’s nothing about his lifestyle that will make them proud.
PRO.17.22	A joyful, cheerful heart brings healing to both body and soul.
PRO.17.22	But the one whose heart is crushed
PRO.17.22	struggles with sickness and depression.
PRO.17.23	When you take a secret bribe,
PRO.17.23	your actions reveal your true character,
PRO.17.23	for you pervert the ways of justice.
PRO.17.24	Even the face of a wise man shows his intelligence.
PRO.17.24	But the wandering eyes of a fool will look for wisdom everywhere
PRO.17.24	except right in front of his nose.
PRO.17.25	A father grieves over the foolishness of his child,
PRO.17.25	and bitter sorrow fills his mother.
PRO.17.26	It’s horrible to persecute a holy lover of God
PRO.17.26	or to strike an honorable man for his integrity!
PRO.17.27	Can you bridle your tongue when your heart is under pressure?
PRO.17.27	That’s how you show that you are wise.
PRO.17.27	An understanding heart keeps you cool, calm, and collected,
PRO.17.27	no matter what you’re facing.
PRO.17.28	When even a fool bites his tongue
PRO.17.28	he’s considered wise.
PRO.17.28	So shut your mouth when you are provoked—
PRO.17.28	it will make you look smart.
PRO.18.1	An unfriendly person isolates himself
PRO.18.1	and seems to care only about his own issues.
PRO.18.1	For his contempt of sound judgment makes him a recluse.
PRO.18.2	Senseless people find no pleasure in acquiring true wisdom,
PRO.18.2	for all they want to do is impress you with what they know.
PRO.18.3	An ungodly man is always cloaked with disgrace,
PRO.18.3	as dishonor and shame are his companions.
PRO.18.4	Words of wisdom are like a fresh, flowing brook—
PRO.18.4	like deep waters that spring forth from within,
PRO.18.4	bubbling up inside the one with understanding.
PRO.18.5	It is atrocious when judges show favor to the guilty
PRO.18.5	and deprive the innocent of justice.
PRO.18.6	A senseless man jumps headfirst into an argument;
PRO.18.6	he’s just asking for a beating for his reckless words.
PRO.18.7	A fool has a big mouth that only gets him into trouble,
PRO.18.7	and he’ll pay the price for what he says.
PRO.18.8	The words of a gossip merely reveal the wounds of his own soul,
PRO.18.8	and his slander penetrates into the innermost being.
PRO.18.9	The one who is too lazy to look for work
PRO.18.9	is the same one who wastes his life away.
PRO.18.10	The character of God is a tower of strength,
PRO.18.10	for the lovers of God delight to run into his heart
PRO.18.10	and be exalted on high.
PRO.18.11	The rich, in their conceit, imagine that their wealth
PRO.18.11	is enough to protect them.
PRO.18.11	It becomes their confidence in a day of trouble.
PRO.18.12	A man’s heart is the proudest when his downfall is nearest,
PRO.18.12	for he won’t see glory until the Lord sees humility.
PRO.18.13	Listen before you speak,
PRO.18.13	for to speak before you’ve heard the facts will bring humiliation.
PRO.18.14	The will to live sustains you when you’re sick,
PRO.18.14	but depression crushes courage and leaves you unable to cope.
PRO.18.15	The spiritually hungry are always ready to learn more,
PRO.18.15	for their hearts are eager to discover new truths.
PRO.18.16	Would you like to meet a very important person?
PRO.18.16	Take a generous gift.
PRO.18.16	It will do wonders to gain entrance into his presence.
PRO.18.17	There are two sides to every story.
PRO.18.17	The first one to speak sounds true until you hear the other side
PRO.18.17	and they set the record straight.
PRO.18.18	A coin toss resolves a dispute
PRO.18.18	and can put an argument to rest
PRO.18.18	between formidable opponents.
PRO.18.19	It is easier to conquer a strong city
PRO.18.19	than to win back a friend whom you’ve offended.
PRO.18.19	Their walls go up, making it nearly impossible to win them back.
PRO.18.20	Sharing words of wisdom is satisfying to your inner being.
PRO.18.20	It encourages you to know
PRO.18.20	that you’ve changed someone else’s life.
PRO.18.21	Your words are so powerful
PRO.18.21	that they will kill or give life,
PRO.18.21	and the talkative person will reap the consequences.
PRO.18.22	When a man finds a wife,
PRO.18.22	he has found a treasure!
PRO.18.22	For she is the gift of God to bring him joy and pleasure.
PRO.18.22	But the one who divorces a good woman
PRO.18.22	loses what is good from his house.
PRO.18.22	To choose an adulteress is both stupid and ungodly.
PRO.18.23	The poor plead for help from the rich,
PRO.18.23	but all they get in return is a harsh response.
PRO.18.24	Some friendships don’t last for long,
PRO.18.24	but there is one loving friend who is joined to your heart
PRO.18.24	closer than any other!
PRO.19.1	It’s better to be honest, even if it leads to poverty,
PRO.19.1	than to live as a dishonest fool.
PRO.19.2	The best way to live is with revelation-knowledge,
PRO.19.2	for without it, you’ll grow impatient and run right into error.
PRO.19.3	There are some people who ruin their own lives
PRO.19.3	and then blame it all on God.
PRO.19.4	Being wealthy means having lots of “friends,”
PRO.19.4	but the poor can’t keep the ones they have.
PRO.19.5	Perjury won’t go unpunished,
PRO.19.5	and liars will get all that they deserve.
PRO.19.6	Everyone wants to be close to the rich and famous,
PRO.19.6	but a generous person has all the friends he wants!
PRO.19.7	When a man is poor, even his family has no use for him.
PRO.19.7	How much more will his “friends” avoid him—
PRO.19.7	for though he begs for help, they won’t respond.
PRO.19.8	Do yourself a favor and love wisdom.
PRO.19.8	Learn all you can,
PRO.19.8	then watch your life flourish and prosper!
PRO.19.9	Tell lies and you’re going to get caught,
PRO.19.9	and the habitual liar is doomed.
PRO.19.10	It doesn’t seem right when you see a fool
PRO.19.10	living in the lap of luxury
PRO.19.10	or a prideful servant ruling over princes.
PRO.19.11	A wise person demonstrates patience,
PRO.19.11	for mercy means holding your tongue.
PRO.19.11	When you are insulted,
PRO.19.11	be quick to forgive and forget it,
PRO.19.11	for you are virtuous when you overlook an offense.
PRO.19.12	The rage of a king is like the roar of a lion,
PRO.19.12	but his sweet favor is like a gentle, refreshing rain.
PRO.19.13	A rebellious son breaks a father’s heart,
PRO.19.13	and a nagging wife can drive you crazy!
PRO.19.14	You can inherit houses and land from your parents,
PRO.19.14	but a good wife only comes as a gracious gift from God!
PRO.19.15	Go ahead—be lazy and passive.
PRO.19.15	But you’ll go hungry if you live that way.
PRO.19.16	Honor God’s holy instructions
PRO.19.16	and life will go well for you.
PRO.19.16	But if you despise his ways and choose your own plans,
PRO.19.16	you will die.
PRO.19.17	Every time you give to the poor you make a loan to the Lord.
PRO.19.17	Don’t worry—you’ll be repaid in full for all the good you’ve done.
PRO.19.18	Don’t be afraid to discipline your children
PRO.19.18	while they’re still young enough to learn.
PRO.19.18	Don’t indulge your children or be swayed by their protests.
PRO.19.19	A hot-tempered man has to pay the price for his anger.
PRO.19.19	If you bail him out once,
PRO.19.19	you’ll do it a dozen times.
PRO.19.20	Listen well to wise counsel
PRO.19.20	and be willing to learn from correction
PRO.19.20	so that by the end of your life
PRO.19.20	you’ll be known for your wisdom.
PRO.19.21	A person may have many ideas concerning God’s plan for his life,
PRO.19.21	but only the designs of his purpose will succeed in the end.
PRO.19.22	A man is charming when he displays tender mercies to others.
PRO.19.22	And a lover of God who is poor and promises nothing
PRO.19.22	is better than a rich liar who never keeps his promises.
PRO.19.23	When you live a life of abandoned love,
PRO.19.23	surrendered before the awe of God,
PRO.19.23	here’s what you’ll experience:
PRO.19.23	Abundant life. Continual protection.
PRO.19.23	And complete satisfaction!
PRO.19.24	There are some people who pretend they’re hurt—
PRO.19.24	deadbeats who won’t even work to feed themselves.
PRO.19.25	If you punish the insolent who don’t know any better,
PRO.19.25	they will learn not to mock.
PRO.19.25	But if you correct a wise man,
PRO.19.25	he will grow even wiser.
PRO.19.26	Children who mistreat their parents
PRO.19.26	are an embarrassment to their family and a public disgrace.
PRO.19.27	So listen, my child.
PRO.19.27	Don’t reject correction
PRO.19.27	or you will certainly wander from the ways of truth.
PRO.19.28	A corrupt witness makes a mockery of justice,
PRO.19.28	for the wicked never play by the rules.
PRO.19.29	Judgment is waiting for those who mock the truth,
PRO.19.29	and foolish living invites a beating.
PRO.20.1	A drunkard is obnoxious, loud, and argumentative;
PRO.20.1	you’re a fool to get intoxicated with strong drink.
PRO.20.2	The rage of a king is like the roar of a lion.
PRO.20.2	Do you really want to go and make him angry?
PRO.20.3	A person of honor will put an argument to rest.
PRO.20.3	Only the stupid want to pick a fight.
PRO.20.4	If you’re too lazy to plant seed,
PRO.20.4	it’s too bad when you have no harvest on which to feed.
PRO.20.5	A man of deep understanding will give good advice,
PRO.20.5	drawing it out from the well within.
PRO.20.6	Many will tell you they’re your loyal friends,
PRO.20.6	but who can find one who is truly trustworthy?
PRO.20.7	The lovers of God will walk in integrity,
PRO.20.7	and their children are fortunate
PRO.20.7	to have godly parents as their examples.
PRO.20.8	A righteous king sits on his judgment seat.
PRO.20.8	He scatters evil away from his kingdom
PRO.20.8	by his wise discernment.
PRO.20.9	Which one of us can truly say,
PRO.20.9	“I am free from sin in my life,
PRO.20.9	for my heart is clean and pure”?
PRO.20.10	Mark it down:
PRO.20.10	God hates it when you demonstrate a double standard—
PRO.20.10	one for “them” and one for “you.”
PRO.20.11	All children show what they’re really like by how they act.
PRO.20.11	You can discern their character,
PRO.20.11	whether they are pure or perverse.
PRO.20.12	Lovers of God have been given eyes to see
PRO.20.12	with spiritual discernment
PRO.20.12	and ears to hear from God.
PRO.20.13	If you spend all your time sleeping, you’ll grow poor.
PRO.20.13	So wake up, sleepyhead! Don’t sleep on the job.
PRO.20.13	And then there will be plenty of food on your table.
PRO.20.14	The buyer says, as he haggles over the price,
PRO.20.14	“That’s junk. It’s worthless!”
PRO.20.14	Then he goes out and brags,
PRO.20.14	“Look at the great bargain I got!”
PRO.20.15	You may have an abundance of wealth,
PRO.20.15	piles of gold and jewels,
PRO.20.15	but there is something of far greater worth:
PRO.20.15	speaking revelation words of knowledge.
PRO.20.16	Anyone stupid enough to guarantee a loan for a stranger
PRO.20.16	deserves to have his property held as security.
PRO.20.17	What you obtain dishonestly may seem sweet at first,
PRO.20.17	but sooner or later you’ll live to regret it.
PRO.20.18	If you solicit good advice, then your plans will succeed.
PRO.20.18	So don’t charge into battle without wisdom,
PRO.20.18	for wars are won by skillful strategy.
PRO.20.19	A blabbermouth will reveal your secrets,
PRO.20.19	so stay away from people who can’t keep their mouths shut.
PRO.20.20	If you despise your father or mother,
PRO.20.20	your life will flicker out like a lamp,
PRO.20.20	extinguished into the deepest darkness.
PRO.20.21	If an inheritance is gained too early in life,
PRO.20.21	it will not be blessed in the end.
PRO.20.22	Don’t ever say, “I’m going to get even with them
PRO.20.22	if it’s the last thing I do!”
PRO.20.22	Wrap God’s grace around your heart
PRO.20.22	and he will be the one to vindicate you.
PRO.20.23	The Lord hates double standards—
PRO.20.23	that’s hypocrisy at its worst!
PRO.20.24	It is the Lord who directs your life,
PRO.20.24	for each step you take is ordained by God
PRO.20.24	to bring you closer to your destiny.
PRO.20.24	So much of your life, then, remains a mystery!
PRO.20.25	Be careful in making a rash promise before God,
PRO.20.25	or you may be trapped by your vow and live to regret it.
PRO.20.26	A wise king is able to discern corruption
PRO.20.26	and remove wickedness from his kingdom.
PRO.20.27	The spirit God breathed into man is like a living lamp,
PRO.20.27	a shining light
PRO.20.27	searching into the innermost chamber of our being.
PRO.20.28	Good leadership is built on love and truth,
PRO.20.28	for kindness and integrity
PRO.20.28	are what keep leaders in their position of trust.
PRO.20.29	We admire the young for their strength and beauty,
PRO.20.29	but the dignity of the old is their wisdom.
PRO.20.30	When you are punished severely, you learn your lesson well—
PRO.20.30	for painful experiences do wonders to change your life.
PRO.21.1	It’s as easy for God to steer a king’s heart for his purposes
PRO.21.1	as it is for him to direct the course of a stream.
PRO.21.2	You may think you’re right all the time,
PRO.21.2	but God thoroughly examines our motives.
PRO.21.3	It pleases God more when we demonstrate godliness and justice
PRO.21.3	than when we merely offer him a sacrifice.
PRO.21.4	Arrogance, superiority, and pride are the fruits of wickedness
PRO.21.4	and the true definition of sin.
PRO.21.5	Brilliant ideas pay off and bring you prosperity,
PRO.21.5	but making hasty, impatient decisions
PRO.21.5	will only lead to financial loss.
PRO.21.6	You can make a fortune dishonestly,
PRO.21.6	but your crime will hold you in the snares of death!
PRO.21.7	Violent rebels don’t have a chance,
PRO.21.7	for their rejection of truth and their love of evil
PRO.21.7	will drag them deeper into darkness.
PRO.21.8	You can discern that a person is guilty by his devious actions
PRO.21.8	and the innocence of a person by his honest, sincere ways.
PRO.21.9	It’s better to live all alone in a rickety shack
PRO.21.9	than to share a castle with a crabby spouse!
PRO.21.10	The wicked always crave what is evil;
PRO.21.10	they’ll show no mercy and get no mercy.
PRO.21.11	Senseless people learn their lessons the hard way,
PRO.21.11	but the wise are teachable.
PRO.21.12	A godly, righteous person has the ability
PRO.21.12	to bring the light of instruction to the wicked
PRO.21.12	even though he despises what the wicked do.
PRO.21.13	If you close your heart to the cries of the poor,
PRO.21.13	then I’ll close my ears when you cry out to me!
PRO.21.14	Try giving a secret gift to the one who is angry with you
PRO.21.14	and watch his anger disappear.
PRO.21.14	A kind, generous gift goes a long way
PRO.21.14	to soothe the anger of one who is livid.
PRO.21.15	When justice is served,
PRO.21.15	the lovers of God celebrate and rejoice,
PRO.21.15	but the wicked begin to panic.
PRO.21.16	When you forsake the ways of wisdom,
PRO.21.16	you will wander into the realm of dark spirits.
PRO.21.17	To love pleasure for pleasure’s sake
PRO.21.17	will introduce you to poverty.
PRO.21.17	Indulging in a life of luxury
PRO.21.17	will never make you wealthy.
PRO.21.18	The wicked bring on themselves
PRO.21.18	the very suffering they planned for others,
PRO.21.18	for their treachery comes back to haunt them.
PRO.21.19	It’s better to live in a hut in the wilderness
PRO.21.19	than with a crabby, scolding spouse!
PRO.21.20	In wisdom’s house you’ll find delightful treasures
PRO.21.20	and the oil of the Holy Spirit.
PRO.21.20	But the stupid squander what they’ve been given.
PRO.21.21	The lovers of God who chase after righteousness
PRO.21.21	will find all their dreams come true:
PRO.21.21	an abundant life drenched with favor
PRO.21.21	and a fountain that overflows with satisfaction.
PRO.21.22	A warrior filled with wisdom ascends into the high place
PRO.21.22	and releases regional breakthrough,
PRO.21.22	bringing down the strongholds of the mighty.
PRO.21.23	Watch your words and be careful what you say,
PRO.21.23	and you’ll be surprised how few troubles you’ll have.
PRO.21.24	An arrogant man is inflated with pride—
PRO.21.24	nothing but a snooty scoffer in love with his own opinion.
PRO.21.24	Mr. Mocker is his name!
PRO.21.25+PRO.21.26	Taking the easy way out is the habit of a lazy man,
PRO.21.25+PRO.21.26	and it will be his downfall.
PRO.21.25+PRO.21.26	All day long he thinks about all the things that he craves,
PRO.21.25+PRO.21.26	for he hasn’t learned the secret that the generous man has learned:
PRO.21.25+PRO.21.26	extravagant giving never leads to poverty.
PRO.21.27	To bring an offering to God with an ulterior motive is detestable,
PRO.21.27	for it amounts to nothing but hypocrisy.
PRO.21.28	No one believes a notorious liar,
PRO.21.28	but the guarded words of an honest man stand the test of time.
PRO.21.29	The wicked are shameless and stubborn,
PRO.21.29	but the lovers of God have a holy confidence.
PRO.21.30	All your brilliant wisdom and clever insight
PRO.21.30	will be of no help at all if the Lord is against you.
PRO.21.31	You can do your best to prepare for the battle,
PRO.21.31	but ultimate victory comes from the Lord God.
PRO.22.1	A beautiful reputation is more to be desired than great riches,
PRO.22.1	and to be esteemed by others is more honorable
PRO.22.1	than to own immense investments.
PRO.22.2	The rich and the poor have one thing in common:
PRO.22.2	the Lord God created each one.
PRO.22.3	A prudent person with insight foresees danger coming
PRO.22.3	and prepares himself for it.
PRO.22.3	But the senseless rush blindly forward
PRO.22.3	and suffer the consequences.
PRO.22.4	Laying your life down in tender surrender before the Lord
PRO.22.4	will bring life, prosperity, and honor as your reward.
PRO.22.5	Twisted and perverse lives are surrounded by demonic influence.
PRO.22.5	If you value your soul, stay far away from them.
PRO.22.6	Dedicate your children to God
PRO.22.6	and point them in the way that they should go,
PRO.22.6	and the values they’ve learned from you will be with them for life.
PRO.22.7	If you borrow money with interest,
PRO.22.7	you’ll end up serving the interests of your creditors,
PRO.22.7	for the rich rule over the poor.
PRO.22.8	Sin is a seed that brings a harvest;
PRO.22.8	you’ll reap a heap of trouble with every seed you plant.
PRO.22.8	For your investment in sins pays a full return—
PRO.22.8	the full punishment you deserve!
PRO.22.9	When you are generous to the poor,
PRO.22.9	you are enriched with blessings in return.
PRO.22.10	Say goodbye to a troublemaker and you’ll say goodbye
PRO.22.10	to quarrels, strife, tension, and arguments,
PRO.22.10	for a troublemaker traffics in shame.
PRO.22.11	The Lord loves those whose hearts are holy,
PRO.22.11	and he is the friend of those whose ways are pure.
PRO.22.12	God passionately watches over
PRO.22.12	his deep reservoir of revelation-knowledge,
PRO.22.12	but he subverts the lies of those who pervert the truth.
PRO.22.13	A slacker always has an excuse for not working—
PRO.22.13	like “I can’t go to work. There’s a lion outside!
PRO.22.13	And murderers too!”
PRO.22.14	Sex with an adulteress is like falling into the abyss.
PRO.22.14	Those under God’s curse jump right in to their own destruction.
PRO.22.15	Although rebellion is woven into a young man’s heart,
PRO.22.15	tough discipline can make him into a man.
PRO.22.16	There are two kinds of people headed toward poverty:
PRO.22.16	those who exploit the poor
PRO.22.16	and those who bribe the rich.
PRO.22.17	Listen carefully and open your heart.
PRO.22.17	Drink in the wise revelation that I impart.
PRO.22.18	You’ll become winsome and wise
PRO.22.18	when you treasure the beauty of my words.
PRO.22.18	And always be prepared to share them at the appropriate time.
PRO.22.19	For I’m releasing these words to you this day,
PRO.22.19	yes, even to you, so that your living hope
PRO.22.19	will be found in God alone,
PRO.22.19	for he is the only one who is always true.
PRO.22.20+PRO.22.21	Pay attention to these excellent sayings of three-fold things.
PRO.22.20+PRO.22.21	For within my words you will discover true and reliable revelation.
PRO.22.20+PRO.22.21	They will give you serenity so that you can reveal
PRO.22.20+PRO.22.21	the truth of the word of the one who sends you.
PRO.22.22	Never oppress the poor
PRO.22.22	or pass laws with the motive of crushing the weak.
PRO.22.23	For the Lord will rise to plead their case
PRO.22.23	and humiliate the one who humiliates the poor.
PRO.22.24+PRO.22.25	Walk away from an angry man
PRO.22.24+PRO.22.25	or you’ll embrace a snare in your soul
PRO.22.24+PRO.22.25	by becoming bad-tempered just like him.
PRO.22.26	Why would you ever guarantee a loan for someone else
PRO.22.26	or promise to be responsible for his debts?
PRO.22.27	For if you fail to pay you could lose your shirt!
PRO.22.28	The previous generation has set boundaries in place.
PRO.22.28	Don’t you dare move them just to benefit yourself.
PRO.22.29	If you are uniquely gifted in your work,
PRO.22.29	you will rise and be promoted.
PRO.22.29	You won’t be held back—
PRO.22.29	you’ll stand before kings!
PRO.23.1	When you’ve been invited to dine with a very important leader,
PRO.23.1	consider your manners and keep in mind who you’re with.
PRO.23.2	Be careful to curb your appetite and catch yourself
PRO.23.2	before you fall into the trap of wanting all you see.
PRO.23.3	Don’t crave their delicacies,
PRO.23.3	for they may have another motive in having you sit at their table.
PRO.23.4	Don’t compare yourself to the rich.
PRO.23.4	Surrender your selfish ambition and evaluate them properly.
PRO.23.5	For no sooner do you start counting your wealth
PRO.23.5	than it sprouts wings and flies away like an eagle in the sky—
PRO.23.5	here today, gone tomorrow!
PRO.23.6	Be sensible when you dine with a stingy man
PRO.23.6	and don’t eat more than you should.
PRO.23.7	For as he thinks within himself, so is he.
PRO.23.7	He will grudgingly say, “Go ahead and eat all you want,”
PRO.23.7	but in his heart he resents the fact that he has to pay for your meal.
PRO.23.8	You’ll be sorry you ate anything at all,
PRO.23.8	and all your compliments will be wasted.
PRO.23.9	A rebellious fool will despise your wise advice,
PRO.23.9	so don’t even waste your time—save your breath!
PRO.23.10	Never move a long-standing boundary line
PRO.23.10	or attempt to take land that belongs to the fatherless.
PRO.23.11	For they have a mighty protector,
PRO.23.11	a loving redeemer, who watches over them,
PRO.23.11	and he will stand up for their cause.
PRO.23.12	Pay close attention to the teaching that corrects you,
PRO.23.12	and open your heart to every word of instruction.
PRO.23.13	Don’t withhold appropriate discipline from your child.
PRO.23.13	Go ahead and punish him when he needs it.
PRO.23.13	Don’t worry—it won’t kill him!
PRO.23.14	A good spanking could be the very thing
PRO.23.14	that teaches him a lifelong lesson!
PRO.23.15	My beloved child, when your heart is full of wisdom,
PRO.23.15	my heart is full of gladness.
PRO.23.16	And when you speak anointed words,
PRO.23.16	we are speaking mouth to mouth!
PRO.23.17	Don’t allow the actions of evil men
PRO.23.17	to cause you to burn with anger.
PRO.23.17	Instead, burn with unrelenting passion
PRO.23.17	as you worship God in holy awe.
PRO.23.18	Your future is bright and filled with a living hope
PRO.23.18	that will never fade away.
PRO.23.19	As you listen to me, my beloved child,
PRO.23.19	you will grow in wisdom and your heart
PRO.23.19	will be drawn into understanding,
PRO.23.19	which will empower you to make right decisions.
PRO.23.20	Don’t live in the excesses of drunkenness or gluttony,
PRO.23.20	or waste your life away by partying all the time,
PRO.23.21	because drunkards and gluttons sleep their lives away
PRO.23.21	and end up broke!
PRO.23.22	Give respect to your father and mother,
PRO.23.22	for without them you wouldn’t even be here.
PRO.23.22	And don’t neglect them when they grow old.
PRO.23.23	Embrace the truth and hold it close.
PRO.23.23	Don’t let go of wisdom, instruction, and life-giving understanding.
PRO.23.24	When a father observes his child living in godliness,
PRO.23.24	he is ecstatic with joy—nothing makes him prouder!
PRO.23.25	So may your father’s heart burst with joy
PRO.23.25	and your mother’s soul be filled with gladness because of you.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me your heart
PRO.23.26	and embrace fully what I’m about to tell you.
PRO.23.27	Stay far away from prostitutes
PRO.23.27	and you’ll stay far away from the pit of destruction.
PRO.23.27	For sleeping with a promiscuous woman is like falling into a trap
PRO.23.27	that you’ll never be able to escape!
PRO.23.28	Like a robber hiding in the shadows
PRO.23.28	she’s waiting to claim another victim—
PRO.23.28	another husband unfaithful to his wife.
PRO.23.29	Who has anguish? Who has bitter sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who constantly complains and argues?
PRO.23.29	Who stumbles and falls and hurts himself?
PRO.23.29	Who’s the one with bloodshot eyes?
PRO.23.30	It’s the one who drinks too much
PRO.23.30	and is always looking for a brew.
PRO.23.30	Make sure it’s never you!
PRO.23.31	And don’t be drunk with wine
PRO.23.31	but be known as one who enjoys the company
PRO.23.31	of the lovers of God,
PRO.23.32	For drunkenness brings the sting of a serpent,
PRO.23.32	like the fangs of a viper spreading poison into your soul.
PRO.23.33	It will make you hallucinate, mumble,
PRO.23.33	and speak words that are perverse.
PRO.23.34	You’ll be like a seasick sailor being tossed to and fro,
PRO.23.34	dizzy and out of your mind.
PRO.23.35	You’ll awake only to say, “What hit me?
PRO.23.35	I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck!”
PRO.23.35	Yet off you’ll go, looking for another drink!
PRO.24.1	Don’t envy the wealth of the wicked or crave their company.
PRO.24.2	For they’re obsessed with causing trouble
PRO.24.2	and their conversations are corrupt.
PRO.24.3	Wise people are builders—
PRO.24.3	they build families, businesses, communities.
PRO.24.3	And through intelligence and insight
PRO.24.3	their enterprises are established and endure.
PRO.24.4	Because of their skilled leadership
PRO.24.4	the hearts of people are filled with the treasures of wisdom
PRO.24.4	and the pleasures of spiritual wealth.
PRO.24.5	Wisdom can make anyone into a mighty warrior,
PRO.24.5	and revelation-knowledge increases strength.
PRO.24.6	Wise strategy is necessary to wage war,
PRO.24.6	and with many astute advisers
PRO.24.6	you’ll see the path to victory more clearly.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is a treasure too lofty for a quarreling fool—
PRO.24.7	he’ll have nothing to say when leaders gather together.
PRO.24.8	There is one who makes plans to do evil—
PRO.24.8	Master Schemer is his name.
PRO.24.9	If you plan to do evil, it’s as wrong as doing it.
PRO.24.9	And everyone detests a troublemaker.
PRO.24.10	If you faint when under pressure,
PRO.24.10	you have need of courage.
PRO.24.11	Go and rescue the perishing! Be their savior!
PRO.24.11	Why would you stand back and watch them stagger to their death?
PRO.24.12	And why would you say, “But it’s none of my business”?
PRO.24.12	The one who knows you completely and judges your every motive
PRO.24.12	is also the keeper of souls—and not just yours!
PRO.24.12	He sees through your excuses and holds you responsible
PRO.24.12	for failing to help those whose lives are threatened.
PRO.24.13	Revelation-knowledge is a delicacy,
PRO.24.13	sweet like flowing honey that melts in your mouth.
PRO.24.13	Eat as much of it as you can, my friend!
PRO.24.14	For then you will perceive what is true wisdom,
PRO.24.14	your future will be bright,
PRO.24.14	and this hope living within will never disappoint you.
PRO.24.15	Listen up, you wicked, irreverent ones—
PRO.24.15	don’t harass the lovers of God
PRO.24.15	and don’t invade their resting place.
PRO.24.16	For the lovers of God may suffer adversity
PRO.24.16	and stumble seven times,
PRO.24.16	but they will continue to rise over and over again.
PRO.24.16	But the unrighteous are brought down by just one calamity
PRO.24.16	.
PRO.24.17	Never gloat when your enemy meets disaster
PRO.24.17	and don’t be quick to rejoice if he falls.
PRO.24.18	For the Lord, who sees your heart,
PRO.24.18	will be displeased with you and will pity your foe.
PRO.24.19	Don’t be angrily offended over evildoers or be agitated by them.
PRO.24.20	For the wicked have no life and no future—
PRO.24.20	their light of life will die out.
PRO.24.21	My child, stand in awe of the Lord Jehovah!
PRO.24.21	Give counsel to others,
PRO.24.21	but don’t mingle with those who are rebellious.
PRO.24.22	For sudden destruction will fall upon them
PRO.24.22	and their lives will be ruined in a moment.
PRO.24.22	And who knows what retribution they will face!
PRO.24.23	Those enlightened with wisdom have spoken these proverbs:
PRO.24.23	Judgment must be impartial,
PRO.24.23	for it is always wrong to be swayed by a person’s status.
PRO.24.24	If you say to the guilty, “You are innocent,”
PRO.24.24	the nation will curse you and the people will revile you.
PRO.24.25	But when you convict the guilty,
PRO.24.25	the people will thank you and reward you with favor.
PRO.24.26	Speaking honestly is a sign of true friendship.
PRO.24.27	Go ahead, build your career and give yourself to your work.
PRO.24.27	But if you put me first, you’ll see your family built up!
PRO.24.28	Why would you be a false accuser and slander with your words?
PRO.24.29	Don’t ever spitefully say, “I’ll get even with him!
PRO.24.29	I’ll do to him what he did to me!”
PRO.24.30+PRO.24.31	One day I passed by the field of a lazy man
PRO.24.30+PRO.24.31	and I noticed the vineyards of a slacker.
PRO.24.30+PRO.24.31	I observed nothing but thorns, weeds, and broken-down walls.
PRO.24.32	So I considered their lack of wisdom,
PRO.24.32	and I pondered the lessons I could learn from this:
PRO.24.33+PRO.24.34	Professional work habits prevent poverty from becoming
PRO.24.33+PRO.24.34	your permanent business partner. And:
PRO.24.33+PRO.24.34	If you put off until tomorrow the work you could do today,
PRO.24.33+PRO.24.34	tomorrow never seems to come.
PRO.25.1	Solomon’s proverbs, published by the scribes of King Hezekiah:
PRO.25.2	God conceals the revelation of his word
PRO.25.2	in the hiding place of his glory.
PRO.25.2	But the honor of kings is revealed
PRO.25.2	by how they thoroughly search out
PRO.25.2	the deeper meaning of all that God says.
PRO.25.3	The heart of a king is full of understanding,
PRO.25.3	like the heavens are high and the ocean is deep.
PRO.25.4	If you burn away the impurities from silver,
PRO.25.4	a sterling vessel will emerge from the fire.
PRO.25.5	And if you purge corruption from the kingdom,
PRO.25.5	a king’s reign will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Don’t boast in the presence of a king
PRO.25.6	or promote yourself by taking a seat at the head table
PRO.25.6	and pretend that you’re someone important.
PRO.25.7	For it is better for the king to say to you,
PRO.25.7	“Come, you should sit at the head table,”
PRO.25.7	than for him to say in front of everyone,
PRO.25.7	“Please get up and move—
PRO.25.7	you’re sitting in the place of the prince.”
PRO.25.8	Don’t be hasty to file a lawsuit.
PRO.25.8	By starting something you wish you hadn’t,
PRO.25.8	you could be humiliated when you lose your case.
PRO.25.9	Don’t reveal another person’s secret
PRO.25.9	just to prove a point in an argument,
PRO.25.9	or you could be accused of being a gossip
PRO.25.10	and gain a reputation for being one
PRO.25.10	who betrays the confidence of a friend.
PRO.25.11	Winsome words spoken at just the right time
PRO.25.11	are as appealing as apples gilded in gold
PRO.25.11	and surrounded with silver.
PRO.25.12	To humbly receive wise correction
PRO.25.12	adorns your life with beauty
PRO.25.12	and makes you a better person.
PRO.25.13	A reliable, trustworthy messenger
PRO.25.13	refreshes the heart of his master,
PRO.25.13	like a gentle breeze blowing at harvest time—
PRO.25.13	cooling the sweat from his brow.
PRO.25.14	Clouds that carry no water
PRO.25.14	and a wind that brings no refreshing rain—
PRO.25.14	that’s what you’re like when you boast
PRO.25.14	of a gift that you don’t have.
PRO.25.15	Use patience and kindness when you want to persuade leaders
PRO.25.15	and watch them change their minds right in front of you.
PRO.25.15	For your gentle wisdom will quell the strongest resistance.
PRO.25.16	When you discover something sweet,
PRO.25.16	don’t overindulge and eat more than you need,
PRO.25.16	for excess in anything can make you sick of even a good thing.
PRO.25.17	Don’t wear out your welcome
PRO.25.17	by staying too long at the home of your friends,
PRO.25.17	or they may get fed up with always having you there
PRO.25.17	and wish you hadn’t come.
PRO.25.18	Lying about and slandering people
PRO.25.18	are as bad as hitting them with a club,
PRO.25.18	or wounding them with an arrow,
PRO.25.18	or stabbing them with a sword.
PRO.25.19	You can’t depend on an unreliable person
PRO.25.19	when you really need help.
PRO.25.19	It can be compared to biting down on an abscessed tooth
PRO.25.19	or walking with a sprained ankle.
PRO.25.20	When you sing a song of joy to someone suffering
PRO.25.20	in the deepest grief and heartache,
PRO.25.20	it can be compared to disrobing in the middle of a blizzard
PRO.25.20	or rubbing salt in a wound.
PRO.25.21	Is your enemy hungry? Buy him lunch.
PRO.25.21	Win him over with your kindness.
PRO.25.22	Your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience
PRO.25.22	and God will reward you with favor.
PRO.25.23	As the north wind brings a storm,
PRO.25.23	saying things you shouldn’t brings a storm to any relationship.
PRO.25.24	It’s better to live all alone in a rundown shack
PRO.25.24	than to share a castle with a crabby spouse!
PRO.25.25	Like a drink of cool water to a weary, thirsty soul,
PRO.25.25	so hearing good news revives the spirit.
PRO.25.26	When a lover of God gives in and compromises with wickedness,
PRO.25.26	it can be compared to contaminating a stream with sewage
PRO.25.26	or polluting a fountain.
PRO.25.27	It’s good to eat sweet things,
PRO.25.27	but you can take too much.
PRO.25.27	It’s good to be honored,
PRO.25.27	but to seek words of praise is not honor at all.
PRO.25.28	If you live without restraint
PRO.25.28	and are unable to control your temper,
PRO.25.28	you’re as helpless as a city with broken-down defenses,
PRO.25.28	open to attack.
PRO.26.1	It is totally out of place to promote and honor a fool,
PRO.26.1	just like it’s out of place to have snow in the summer
PRO.26.1	and rain at harvest time.
PRO.26.2	An undeserved curse will be powerless to harm you.
PRO.26.2	It may flutter over you like a bird,
PRO.26.2	but it will find no place to land.
PRO.26.3	Guide a horse with a whip,
PRO.26.3	direct a donkey with a bridle,
PRO.26.3	and lead a rebellious fool with a beating on his backside!
PRO.26.4	Don’t respond to the words of a fool with more foolish words,
PRO.26.4	or you will become as foolish as he is!
PRO.26.5	Instead, if you’re asked a silly question,
PRO.26.5	answer it with words of wisdom
PRO.26.5	so the fool doesn’t think he’s so clever.
PRO.26.6	If you choose a fool to represent you,
PRO.26.6	you’re asking for trouble.
PRO.26.6	It will be as bad for you as cutting off your own feet!
PRO.26.7	You can never trust the words of a fool,
PRO.26.7	just like a crippled man can’t trust his legs to support him.
PRO.26.8	Give honor to a fool and watch it backfire—
PRO.26.8	like a stone tied to a slingshot.
PRO.26.9	The statements of a fool will hurt others
PRO.26.9	like a thorn bush brandished by a drunk.
PRO.26.10	Like a reckless archer shooting arrows at random
PRO.26.10	is the impatient employer
PRO.26.10	who hires just any fool who comes along—
PRO.26.10	someone’s going to get hurt!
PRO.26.11	Fools are famous for repeating their errors,
PRO.26.11	like dogs are known to return to their vomit.
PRO.26.12	There’s only one thing worse than a fool,
PRO.26.12	and that’s the smug, conceited man
PRO.26.12	always in love with his own opinions.
PRO.26.13	The lazy loafer says,
PRO.26.13	“I can’t go out and look for a job—
PRO.26.13	there may be a lion out there roaming wild in the streets!”
PRO.26.14	As a door is hinged to the wall,
PRO.26.14	so the lazy man keeps turning over, hinged to his bed!
PRO.26.15	There are some people so lazy
PRO.26.15	they won’t even work to feed themselves.
PRO.26.16	A self-righteous person is convinced he’s smarter
PRO.26.16	than seven wise counselors who tell him the truth.
PRO.26.17	It’s better to grab a mad dog by its ears
PRO.26.17	than to meddle and interfere in a quarrel
PRO.26.17	that’s none of your business.
PRO.26.18+PRO.26.19	The one who is caught lying to his friend
PRO.26.18+PRO.26.19	and says, “I didn’t mean it, I was only joking,”
PRO.26.18+PRO.26.19	can be compared to a madman
PRO.26.18+PRO.26.19	randomly shooting off deadly weapons.
PRO.26.20	It takes fuel to have a fire—
PRO.26.20	a fire dies down when you run out of fuel.
PRO.26.20	So quarrels disappear when the gossip ends.
PRO.26.21	Add fuel to the fire and the blaze goes on.
PRO.26.21	So add an argumentative man to the mix
PRO.26.21	and you’ll keep strife alive.
PRO.26.22	Gossip is so delicious, and how we love to swallow it!
PRO.26.22	For slander is easily absorbed into our innermost being.
PRO.26.23	Smooth talk can hide a corrupt heart
PRO.26.23	just like a pretty glaze covers a cheap clay pot.
PRO.26.24	Kind words can be a cover to conceal hatred of others,
PRO.26.24	for hypocrisy loves to hide behind flattery.
PRO.26.25	So don’t be drawn in by the hypocrite,
PRO.26.25	for his gracious speech is a charade,
PRO.26.25	nothing but a masquerade covering his hatred and evil on parade.
PRO.26.26	Don’t worry—he can’t keep the mask on for long.
PRO.26.26	One day his hypocrisy will be exposed before all the world.
PRO.26.27	Go ahead, set a trap for others—
PRO.26.27	and then watch as it snaps back on you!
PRO.26.27	Start a landslide and you’ll be the one who gets crushed.
PRO.26.28	Hatred is the root of slander
PRO.26.28	and insecurity the root of flattery.
PRO.27.1	Never brag about the plans you have for tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	for you don’t have a clue what tomorrow may bring to you.
PRO.27.2	Let someone else honor you for your accomplishments,
PRO.27.2	for self-praise is never appropriate.
PRO.27.3	It’s easier to carry a heavy boulder and a ton of sand
PRO.27.3	than to be provoked by a fool and have to carry that burden!
PRO.27.4	The rage and anger of others can be overwhelming,
PRO.27.4	but it’s nothing compared to jealousy’s fire.
PRO.27.5	It’s better to be corrected openly
PRO.27.5	if it stems from hidden love.
PRO.27.6	You can trust a friend who wounds you with his honesty,
PRO.27.6	but your enemy’s pretended flattery comes from insincerity.
PRO.27.7	When your soul is full, you turn down even the sweetest honey.
PRO.27.7	But when your soul is starving,
PRO.27.7	every bitter thing becomes sweet.
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that has fallen from its nest
PRO.27.8	is the one who is dislodged from his home.
PRO.27.9	Sweet friendships refresh the soul and awaken our hearts with joy,
PRO.27.9	for good friends are like the anointing oil
PRO.27.9	that yields the fragrant incense 
PRO.27.10	So never give up on a friend or abandon a friend of your father—
PRO.27.10	for in the day of your brokenness
PRO.27.10	you won’t have to run to a relative for help.
PRO.27.10	A friend nearby is better than a relative far away.
PRO.27.11	My son, when you walk in wisdom,
PRO.27.11	my heart is filled with gladness,
PRO.27.11	for the way you live is proof
PRO.27.11	that I’ve not taught you in vain.
PRO.27.12	A wise, shrewd person discerns the danger ahead
PRO.27.12	and prepares himself,
PRO.27.12	but the naïve simpleton never looks ahead
PRO.27.12	and suffers the consequences.
PRO.27.13	Cosign for one you barely know and you will pay a great price!
PRO.27.13	Anyone stupid enough to guarantee the loan of another
PRO.27.13	deserves to have his property seized in payment.
PRO.27.14	Do you think you’re blessing your neighbors
PRO.27.14	when you sing at the top of your lungs early in the morning?
PRO.27.14	Don’t be fooled—
PRO.27.14	they’ll curse you for doing it!
PRO.27.15	An endless drip, drip, drip, from a leaky faucet
PRO.27.15	and the words of a cranky, nagging wife have the same effect.
PRO.27.16	Can you stop the north wind from blowing
PRO.27.16	or grasp a handful of oil?
PRO.27.16	That’s easier than to stop her from complaining.
PRO.27.17	It takes a grinding wheel to sharpen a blade,
PRO.27.17	and so one person sharpens the character of another.
PRO.27.18	Tend an orchard and you’ll have fruit to eat.
PRO.27.18	Serve the Master’s interests
PRO.27.18	and you’ll receive honor that’s sweet.
PRO.27.19	Just as no two faces are exactly alike,
PRO.27.19	so every heart is different.
PRO.27.20	Death and destruction are never filled,
PRO.27.20	and the desires of men’s hearts are insatiable.
PRO.27.21	Fire is the way to test the purity of silver and gold,
PRO.27.21	but the character of a man is tested
PRO.27.21	by giving him a measure of fame.
PRO.27.22	You can beat a fool half to death
PRO.27.22	and still never beat the foolishness out of him.
PRO.27.23	A shepherd should pay close attention to the faces of his flock
PRO.27.23	and hold close to his heart the condition of those he cares for.
PRO.27.24	A man’s strength, power, and riches will one day fade away;
PRO.27.24	not even nations endure forever.
PRO.27.25+PRO.27.26+PRO.27.27	Take care of your responsibilities
PRO.27.25+PRO.27.26+PRO.27.27	and be diligent in your business
PRO.27.25+PRO.27.26+PRO.27.27	and you will have more than enough—
PRO.27.25+PRO.27.26+PRO.27.27	an abundance of food, clothing, and plenty for your household.
PRO.28.1	Guilty criminals experience paranoia
PRO.28.1	even though no one threatens them.
PRO.28.1	But the innocent lovers of God,
PRO.28.1	because of righteousness,
PRO.28.1	will have the boldness of a young, ferocious lion!
PRO.28.2	A rebellious nation is thrown into chaos,
PRO.28.2	but leaders anointed with wisdom will restore law and order.
PRO.28.3	When a pauper oppresses the destitute,
PRO.28.3	it’s like a flash flood that sweeps away their last hope.
PRO.28.4	Those who turn their backs on what they know is right
PRO.28.4	will no longer be able to tell right from wrong.
PRO.28.4	But those who love the truth strengthen their souls.
PRO.28.5	Justice never makes sense to men devoted to darkness,
PRO.28.5	but those tenderly devoted to the Lord
PRO.28.5	can understand justice perfectly.
PRO.28.6	It’s more respectable to be poor and pure than rich and perverse.
PRO.28.7	To be obedient to what you’ve been taught
PRO.28.7	proves you’re an honorable child,
PRO.28.7	but to socialize with the lawless brings shame to your parents.
PRO.28.8	Go ahead and get rich on the backs of the poor,
PRO.28.8	but all the wealth you gather will one day be given
PRO.28.8	to those who are kind to the needy.
PRO.28.9	If you close your heart and refuse to listen to God’s instruction,
PRO.28.9	even your prayer will be despised.
PRO.28.10	Those who tempt the lovers of God with an evil scheme
PRO.28.10	will fall into their own trap.
PRO.28.10	But the innocent who resist temptation will experience reward.
PRO.28.11	The wealthy in their conceit presume to be wise,
PRO.28.11	but a poor person with discernment can see right through them.
PRO.28.12	The triumphant joy of God’s lovers releases great glory.
PRO.28.12	But when the wicked rise to power, everyone goes into hiding.
PRO.28.13	If you cover up your sin you’ll never do well.
PRO.28.13	But if you confess your sins and forsake them,
PRO.28.13	you will be kissed by mercy.
PRO.28.14	Overjoyed is the one who with tender heart trembles before God,
PRO.28.14	but the stubborn, unyielding heart will experience even greater evil.
PRO.28.15	Ruthless rulers can only be compared
PRO.28.15	to raging lions and roaming bears.
PRO.28.16	Abusive leaders fail to employ wisdom,
PRO.28.16	but leaders who despise corruption
PRO.28.16	will enjoy a long and full life.
PRO.28.17	A murderer’s conscience will torment him—
PRO.28.17	a fugitive haunted by guilt all the way to the grave
PRO.28.17	with no one to support him.
PRO.28.18	The pure will be rescued from failure,
PRO.28.18	but the perverse will suddenly fall into ruin.
PRO.28.19	Work hard and you’ll have all you desire,
PRO.28.19	but chase a fantasy and you could end up with nothing.
PRO.28.20	Life’s blessings drench the honest and faithful person,
PRO.28.20	but punishment rains down upon the greedy and dishonest.
PRO.28.21	Giving favoritism to the rich and powerful is disgusting,
PRO.28.21	and this is the type of judge who would betray a man for a bribe.
PRO.28.22	A greedy man is in a race to get rich,
PRO.28.22	but he forgets that he could lose what’s most important
PRO.28.22	and end up with nothing.
PRO.28.23	If you correct someone with constructive criticism,
PRO.28.23	in the end he will appreciate it more than flattery.
PRO.28.24	A person who would reject his own parents and say,
PRO.28.24	“What’s wrong with that?” is as bad as a murderer.
PRO.28.25	To make rash, hasty decisions
PRO.28.25	shows that you are not trusting the Lord.
PRO.28.25	But when you rely totally on God,
PRO.28.25	you will still act carefully and prudently.
PRO.28.26	Self-confident know-it-alls will prove to be fools.
PRO.28.26	But when you lean on the wisdom from above,
PRO.28.26	you will have a way to escape the troubles of your own making.
PRO.28.27	You will never go without if you give to the poor.
PRO.28.27	But if you’re heartless, stingy, and selfish,
PRO.28.27	you invite curses upon yourself.
PRO.28.28	When wicked leaders rise to power,
PRO.28.28	good people go into hiding.
PRO.28.28	But when they fall from power,
PRO.28.28	the godly take their place.
PRO.29.1	Stubborn people who repeatedly refuse to accept correction
PRO.29.1	will suddenly be broken and never recover.
PRO.29.2	Everyone rejoices when the lovers of God flourish,
PRO.29.2	but the people groan when the wicked rise to power.
PRO.29.3	When you love wisdom, your father is overjoyed.
PRO.29.3	But when you associate with prostitutes,
PRO.29.3	you waste your wealth in exchange for disgrace.
PRO.29.4	A godly leader who values justice
PRO.29.4	is a great strength and example to the people.
PRO.29.4	But the one who sells his influence for money
PRO.29.4	tears down what is right.
PRO.29.5	Flattery can often be used as a trap to hide ulterior motives
PRO.29.5	and take advantage of you.
PRO.29.6	The wicked always have a trap laid for others,
PRO.29.6	but the lovers of God escape as they sing and shout
PRO.29.6	in joyous triumph!
PRO.29.7	God’s righteous people will pour themselves out for the poor,
PRO.29.7	but the ungodly make no attempt to understand or help the needy.
PRO.29.8	Arrogant cynics love to pick fights,
PRO.29.8	but the humble and wise love to pursue peace.
PRO.29.9	There’s no use arguing with a fool,
PRO.29.9	for his ranting and raving prevent you from making a case
PRO.29.9	and settling the argument in a calm way.
PRO.29.10	Violent men hate those with integrity,
PRO.29.10	but the lovers of God esteem those who are holy.
PRO.29.11	You can recognize fools by the way
PRO.29.11	they give full vent to their rage
PRO.29.11	and let their words fly!
PRO.29.11	But the wise bite their tongue and hold back all they could say.
PRO.29.12	When leaders listen to false accusations,
PRO.29.12	their associates become scoundrels.
PRO.29.13	Poor people and their oppressors
PRO.29.13	have only one thing in common—
PRO.29.13	God made them both.
PRO.29.14	The best insurance for a leader’s longevity
PRO.29.14	is to demonstrate justice for the poor.
PRO.29.15	Experiencing many corrections and rebukes will make you wise.
PRO.29.15	But if left to your own ways, you’ll bring disgrace to your parents.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are in power, lawlessness abounds.
PRO.29.16	But the patient lovers of God will one day watch in triumph
PRO.29.16	as their stronghold topples!
PRO.29.17	Correct your child and one day you’ll find he has changed
PRO.29.17	and will bring you great delight.
PRO.29.18	When there is no clear prophetic vision,
PRO.29.18	people quickly wander astray.
PRO.29.18	But when you follow the revelation of the word,
PRO.29.18	heaven’s bliss fills your soul.
PRO.29.19	A stubborn servant can’t be corrected by words alone.
PRO.29.19	For even if he understands, he pays no attention to you.
PRO.29.20	There’s only one kind of person who is worse than a fool:
PRO.29.20	the impetuous one who speaks without thinking first.
PRO.29.21	If you pamper your servants,
PRO.29.21	don’t be surprised when they expect to be treated as sons.
PRO.29.22	The source of strife is found in an angry heart,
PRO.29.22	for sin surrounds the life of a furious man.
PRO.29.23	Lift yourself up with pride and you will soon be brought low,
PRO.29.23	but a meek and humble spirit will add to your honor.
PRO.29.24	You are your own worst enemy when you partner with a thief,
PRO.29.24	for a curse of guilt will come upon you
PRO.29.24	when you fail to report a crime.
PRO.29.25	Fear and intimidation is a trap that holds you back.
PRO.29.25	But when you place your confidence in the Lord,
PRO.29.25	you will be seated in the high place.
PRO.29.26	Everyone curries favor with leaders.
PRO.29.26	But God is the judge, and justice comes from him.
PRO.29.27	The wicked hate those who live a godly life,
PRO.29.27	but the righteous hate injustice wherever it’s found.
PRO.30.1	These are the collected sayings of the prophet Agur, Jakeh’s son—
PRO.30.1	the amazing revelation he imparted to Ithiel and Ukal.
PRO.30.2	God, I’m so weary and worn out,
PRO.30.2	I feel more like a beast than a man.
PRO.30.2	I was made in your image,
PRO.30.2	but I lack understanding.
PRO.30.3	I’ve yet to learn the wisdom
PRO.30.3	that comes from the full and intimate knowledge of you,
PRO.30.3	the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who is it that travels back and forth
PRO.30.4	from the heavenly realm to the earth?
PRO.30.4	Who controls the wind as it blows and holds it in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who tucks the rain into the cloak of his clouds?
PRO.30.4	Who stretches out the skyline from one vista to the other?
PRO.30.4	What is his name?
PRO.30.4	And what is the name of his Son?
PRO.30.4	Who can tell me?
PRO.30.5	Every promise from the faithful God
PRO.30.5	is pure and proves to be true.
PRO.30.5	He is a wrap-around shield of protection for all his lovers
PRO.30.5	who run to hide in him.
PRO.30.6	Never add to his words,
PRO.30.6	or he will have to rebuke you and prove that you’re a liar.
PRO.30.7	God, there are two things I’m asking you for before I die, only two:
PRO.30.8	Empty out of my heart everything that is false—
PRO.30.8	every lie, and every crooked thing.
PRO.30.8	And give me neither undue poverty nor undue wealth—
PRO.30.8	but rather, feed my soul with the measure of prosperity
PRO.30.8	that pleases you.
PRO.30.9	May my satisfaction be found in you.
PRO.30.9	Don’t let me be so rich that I don’t need you
PRO.30.9	or so poor that I have to resort to dishonesty
PRO.30.9	just to make ends meet.
PRO.30.9	Then my life will never detract from bringing glory to your name.
PRO.30.10	Never defame a servant before his master,
PRO.30.10	for you will be the guilty one
PRO.30.10	and a curse will come upon you.
PRO.30.11	There is a generation rising that curses their fathers
PRO.30.11	and speaks evil of their mothers.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation rising that considers themselves
PRO.30.12	to be pure in their own eyes,
PRO.30.12	yet they are morally filthy, unwashed, and unclean.
PRO.30.13	There is a generation rising that is so filled with pride
PRO.30.13	they think they are superior and look down on others.
PRO.30.14	There is a generation rising that uses their words like swords
PRO.30.14	to cut and slash those who are different.
PRO.30.14	They would devour the poor, the needy, and the afflicted
PRO.30.14	from off the face of the earth!
PRO.30.15	There are three words to describe the greedy:
PRO.30.15	“Give me more!”
PRO.30.15	There are some things that are never satisfied.
PRO.30.15	Forever craving more, they’re unable to say, “That’s enough!”
PRO.30.15	Here are four:
PRO.30.16	The grave, yawning for another victim,
PRO.30.16	the barren womb, ever wanting a child,
PRO.30.16	thirsty soil, ever longing for rain,
PRO.30.16	and a raging fire, devouring its fuel.
PRO.30.16	They’re all insatiable.
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks his father and dishonors his elderly mother
PRO.30.17	deserves to be plucked out by the ravens of the valley
PRO.30.17	and fed to the young vultures!
PRO.30.18	There are four marvelous mysteries
PRO.30.18	that are too amazing to unravel—
PRO.30.18	who could fully explain them?
PRO.30.19	The way an eagle flies in the sky,
PRO.30.19	the way a snake glides on a boulder,
PRO.30.19	the path of a ship as it passes through the sea,
PRO.30.19	and the way a bridegroom falls in love with his bride.
PRO.30.20	Here is the deceptive way of the adulterous woman:
PRO.30.20	she takes what she wants and then says,
PRO.30.20	“I’ve done nothing wrong.”
PRO.30.21	There are four intolerable events
PRO.30.21	that are simply unbearable to observe:
PRO.30.22	when an unfaithful servant becomes a ruler,
PRO.30.22	when a scoundrel comes into great wealth,
PRO.30.23	when an unfaithful woman marries a good man,
PRO.30.23	and when a mistress replaces a faithful wife.
PRO.30.24	The earth has four creatures that are very small but very wise:
PRO.30.25	The feeble ant has little strength,
PRO.30.25	yet look how it diligently gathers its food in the summer
PRO.30.25	to last throughout the winter.
PRO.30.26	The delicate rock-badger isn’t all that strong,
PRO.30.26	yet look how it makes a secure home, nestled in the rocks.
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king to lead them,
PRO.30.27	yet they cooperate as they move forward by bands.
PRO.30.28	And the small lizard is easy to catch
PRO.30.28	as it clings to the walls with its hands,
PRO.30.28	yet it can be found inside a king’s palace.
PRO.30.29	There are four stately monarchs
PRO.30.29	who are impressive to watch as they go forth:
PRO.30.30	the lion, the king of the jungle, who is afraid of no one,
PRO.30.31	the rooster strutting boldly among the hens,
PRO.30.31	the male goat out in front leading the herd,
PRO.30.31	and a king leading his regal procession.
PRO.30.32	If you’ve acted foolishly by drawing attention to yourself,
PRO.30.32	or if you’ve thought about saying something stupid,
PRO.30.32	you’d better shut your mouth.
PRO.30.33	For such stupidity may give you a bloody nose!
PRO.30.33	Stirring up an argument only leads to an angry confrontation.
PRO.31.1	King Lemuel’s royal words of wisdom:
PRO.31.1	These are the inspired words my mother taught me.
PRO.31.2	Listen, my dear son, son of my womb.
PRO.31.2	You are the answer to my prayers, my son.
PRO.31.3	So keep yourself sexually pure
PRO.31.3	from the promiscuous, wayward woman.
PRO.31.3	Don’t waste the strength of your anointing
PRO.31.3	on those who ruin kings—
PRO.31.3	you’ll live to regret it!
PRO.31.4	For you are a king, Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	and it’s never fitting for a king to be drunk on wine
PRO.31.4	or for rulers to crave alcohol.
PRO.31.5	For when they drink they forget justice
PRO.31.5	and ignore the rights of those in need,
PRO.31.5	.
PRO.31.6+PRO.31.7	Strong drink is given to the terminally ill,
PRO.31.6+PRO.31.7	who are suffering at the brink of death.
PRO.31.6+PRO.31.7	Wine is for those in depression
PRO.31.6+PRO.31.7	in order to drown their sorrows.
PRO.31.6+PRO.31.7	Let them drink and forget their poverty and misery.
PRO.31.8	But you are to be a king who speaks up on behalf
PRO.31.8	of the disenfranchised
PRO.31.8	and pleads for the legal rights of the defenseless
PRO.31.8	and those who are dying.
PRO.31.9	Be a righteous king, judging on behalf of the poor
PRO.31.9	and interceding for those most in need.
PRO.31.10	Who could ever find a wife like this one—
PRO.31.10	she is a woman of strength and mighty valor!
PRO.31.10	She’s full of wealth and wisdom.
PRO.31.10	The price paid for her was greater than many jewels.
PRO.31.11	Her husband has entrusted his heart to her,
PRO.31.11	for she brings him the rich spoils of victory.
PRO.31.12	All throughout her life she brings him what is good and not evil.
PRO.31.13	She searches out continually to possess
PRO.31.13	that which is pure and righteous.
PRO.31.13	She delights in the work of her hands.
PRO.31.14	She gives out revelation-truth to feed others.
PRO.31.14	She is like a trading ship bringing divine supplies
PRO.31.14	from the merchant.
PRO.31.15	Even in the night season she arises and sets food on the table
PRO.31.15	for hungry ones in her house and for others.
PRO.31.16	She sets her heart upon a nation and takes it as her own,
PRO.31.16	carrying it within her.
PRO.31.16	She labors there to plant the living vines.
PRO.31.17	She wraps herself in strength, might, and power in all her works.
PRO.31.18	She tastes and experiences a better substance,
PRO.31.18	and her shining light will not be extinguished,
PRO.31.18	no matter how dark the night.
PRO.31.19	She stretches out her hands to help the needy
PRO.31.19	and she lays hold of the wheels of government.
PRO.31.20	She is known by her extravagant generosity to the poor,
PRO.31.20	for she always reaches out her hands to those in need.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of tribulation,
PRO.31.21	for all her household is covered in the dual garments
PRO.31.21	of righteousness and grace.
PRO.31.22	Her clothing is beautifully knit together—
PRO.31.22	a purple gown of exquisite linen.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is famous and admired by all,
PRO.31.23	sitting as the venerable judge of his people.
PRO.31.24	Even her works of righteousness
PRO.31.24	she does for the benefit of her enemies.
PRO.31.25	Bold power and glorious majesty are wrapped around her
PRO.31.25	as she laughs with joy over the latter days.
PRO.31.26	Her teachings are filled with wisdom and kindness
PRO.31.26	as loving instruction pours from her lips.
PRO.31.27	She watches over the ways of her household
PRO.31.27	and meets every need they have.
PRO.31.28	Her sons and daughters arise in one accord to extol her virtues,
PRO.31.28	and her husband arises to speak of her in glowing terms.
PRO.31.29	“There are many valiant and noble ones,
PRO.31.29	but you have ascended above them all!”
PRO.31.30	Charm can be misleading,
PRO.31.30	and beauty is vain and so quickly fades,
PRO.31.30	but this virtuous woman lives in the wonder, awe,
PRO.31.30	and fear of the Lord.
PRO.31.30	She will be praised 
PRO.31.31	So go ahead and give her the credit that is due,
PRO.31.31	for she has become a radiant woman,
PRO.31.31	and all her loving works of righteousness deserve to be admired
PRO.31.31	at the gateways of every city!
SNG.1.1	The most amazing song of all, by King Solomon.
SNG.1.2	Let him smother me with kisses—his Spirit-kiss divine.
SNG.1.2	So kind are your caresses,
SNG.1.2	I drink them in like the sweetest wine!
SNG.1.3	Your presence releases a fragrance so pleasing—
SNG.1.3	over and over poured out.
SNG.1.3	For your lovely name is “Flowing Oil.”
SNG.1.3	No wonder the brides-to-be adore you.
SNG.1.4	Draw me into your heart.
SNG.1.4	We will run away together into the king’s cloud-filled chamber.
SNG.1.4	We will remember your love, rejoicing and delighting in you,
SNG.1.4	celebrating your every kiss as better than wine.
SNG.1.4	No wonder righteousness adores you!
SNG.1.5	Jerusalem maidens, in this twilight darkness
SNG.1.5	I know I am so unworthy—so in need.
SNG.1.5	I feel as dark and dry as the desert tents
SNG.1.5	of the wandering nomads.
SNG.1.6	Please don’t stare in scorn
SNG.1.6	because of my dark and sinful ways.
SNG.1.6	My angry brothers quarreled with me
SNG.1.6	and appointed me guardian of their ministry vineyards,
SNG.1.6	yet I’ve not tended my vineyard within.
SNG.1.7	Won’t you tell me, lover of my soul,
SNG.1.7	where do you feed your flock?
SNG.1.7	Where do you lead your beloved ones
SNG.1.7	to rest in the heat of the day?
SNG.1.7	For I wish to be wrapped all around you
SNG.1.7	as I wander among the flocks of your shepherds.
SNG.1.7	It is you I long for, with no veil between us!
SNG.1.12	As the king surrounded me at his table,
SNG.1.12	the sweet fragrance of my praise perfume
SNG.1.12	awakened the night.
SNG.1.13	A sachet of myrrh is my lover,
SNG.1.13	like a tied-up bundle of myrrh resting over my heart.
SNG.1.14	He is like a bouquet of henna blossoms—
SNG.1.14	henna plucked near the vines at the fountain of the Lamb.
SNG.1.14	I will hold him and never let him part.
SNG.1.16	My beloved one,
SNG.1.16	both handsome and winsome,
SNG.1.16	you are pleasing beyond words.
SNG.1.16	Our resting place is anointed and flourishing,
SNG.1.16	like a green forest meadow bathed in light.
SNG.1.17	Rafters of cedar branches are over our heads
SNG.1.17	and balconies of pleasant-smelling pines.
SNG.2.1	I am truly his rose,
SNG.2.1	the very theme of his song.
SNG.2.1	I’m overshadowed by his love,
SNG.2.1	growing in the valley!
SNG.2.3	My beloved is to me
SNG.2.3	the most fragrant apple tree—
SNG.2.3	he stands above the sons of men.
SNG.2.3	Sitting under his grace-shadow,
SNG.2.3	I blossom in his shade,
SNG.2.3	enjoying the sweet taste of his pleasant, delicious fruit,
SNG.2.3	resting with delight where his glory never fades.
SNG.2.4	Suddenly, he transported me into his house of wine—
SNG.2.4	he looked upon me with his unrelenting love divine.
SNG.2.5	Revive me with your raisin cakes.
SNG.2.5	Refresh me again with your apples.
SNG.2.5	Help me and hold me, for I am lovesick!
SNG.2.5	I am longing for more—
SNG.2.5	?
SNG.2.6	His left hand cradles my head
SNG.2.6	while his right hand holds me close.
SNG.2.6	I am at rest in this love.
SNG.2.8	Listen! I hear my lover’s voice.
SNG.2.8	I know it’s him coming to me—
SNG.2.8	leaping with joy over mountains,
SNG.2.8	skipping in love over the hills 
SNG.2.8	to come to me.
SNG.2.9	Let me describe him:
SNG.2.9	he is graceful as a gazelle,
SNG.2.9	swift as a wild stag.
SNG.2.9	Now he comes closer,
SNG.2.9	even to the places where I hide.
SNG.2.9	He gazes into my soul,
SNG.2.9	peering through the portal
SNG.2.9	as he blossoms within my heart.
SNG.2.10	The one I love calls to me:
SNG.2.16	I know my lover is mine and I have everything in you,
SNG.2.16	for we delight ourselves in each other.
SNG.2.17	But until the day springs to life
SNG.2.17	and the shifting shadows of fear disappear,
SNG.2.17	turn around, my lover, and ascend
SNG.2.17	to the holy mountains of separation without me.
SNG.2.17	Until the new day fully dawns,
SNG.2.17	run on ahead like the graceful gazelle
SNG.2.17	and skip like the young stag
SNG.2.17	over the mountains of separation.
SNG.2.17	Go on ahead to the mountain of spices—
SNG.2.17	.
SNG.3.1	Night after night I’m tossing and turning on my bed of travail.
SNG.3.1	Why did I let him go from me?
SNG.3.1	How my heart now aches for him,
SNG.3.1	but he is nowhere to be found!
SNG.3.2	So I must rise in search of him,
SNG.3.2	looking throughout the city,
SNG.3.2	seeking until I find him.
SNG.3.2	Even if I have to roam through every street,
SNG.3.2	nothing will keep me from my search.
SNG.3.2	Where is he—my soul’s true love?
SNG.3.2	He is nowhere to be found.
SNG.3.3	Then I encountered the overseers as they encircled the city.
SNG.3.3	So I asked them, “Have you found him—
SNG.3.3	my heart’s true love?”
SNG.3.4	Just as I moved past them, I encountered him.
SNG.3.4	I found the one I adore!
SNG.3.4	I caught him and fastened myself to him,
SNG.3.4	refusing to be feeble in my heart again.
SNG.3.4	Now I’ll bring him back to the temple within
SNG.3.4	where I was given new birth—
SNG.3.4	into my innermost parts, the place of my conceiving.
SNG.4.6	I’ve made up my mind.
SNG.4.6	Until the darkness disappears and the dawn has fully come,
SNG.4.6	in spite of shadows and fears,
SNG.4.6	I will go to the mountaintop with you—
SNG.4.6	the mountain of suffering love
SNG.4.6	and the hill of burning incense.
SNG.4.6	.
SNG.4.16	Then may your awakening breath
SNG.4.16	blow upon my life until I am fully yours.
SNG.4.16	Breathe upon me with your Spirit wind.
SNG.4.16	Stir up the sweet spice of your life within me.
SNG.4.16	Spare nothing as you make me your fruitful garden.
SNG.4.16	Hold nothing back until I release your fragrance.
SNG.4.16	Come walk with me as you walked
SNG.4.16	with Adam in your paradise garden.
SNG.4.16	Come taste the fruits of your life in me.
SNG.4.16	Come walk with me until I am fully yours.
SNG.4.16	Come taste the fruits of your life in me.
SNG.5.2	After this I let my devotion slumber,
SNG.5.2	but my heart for him stayed awake.
SNG.5.2	I had a dream.
SNG.5.2	I dreamed of my beloved—
SNG.5.2	he was coming to me in the darkness of night.
SNG.5.2	The melody of the man I love awakened me.
SNG.5.2	I heard his knock at my heart’s door
SNG.5.2	as he pleaded with me:
SNG.5.3	I have already laid aside my own garments for you.
SNG.5.3	How could I take them up again
SNG.5.3	since I’ve yielded my righteousness to yours?
SNG.5.3	You have cleansed my life and taken me so far.
SNG.5.3	Isn’t that enough?
SNG.5.4	My beloved reached into me to unlock my heart.
SNG.5.4	The core of my very being trembled at his touch.
SNG.5.4	How my soul melted when he spoke to me!
SNG.5.5	My spirit arose to open for more of his touch.
SNG.5.5	As I surrendered to him, I began to sense his fragrance—
SNG.5.5	the fragrance of his suffering love!
SNG.5.5	It was the sense of myrrh flowing all through me!
SNG.5.6	I opened my soul to my beloved, but suddenly he was gone!
SNG.5.6	And my heart was torn out in longing for him.
SNG.5.6	I sought his presence, his fragrance,
SNG.5.6	but could not find him anywhere.
SNG.5.6	I called out for him, yet he did not answer me.
SNG.5.6	I will arise and search for him until I find him.
SNG.5.7	As I walked throughout the city in search of him,
SNG.5.7	the overseers stopped me as they made their rounds.
SNG.5.7	They beat me and bruised me until I could take no more.
SNG.5.7	They wounded me deeply
SNG.5.7	and removed their covering from me.
SNG.5.8	Nevertheless, make me this promise, you brides-to-be:
SNG.5.8	if you find my beloved one,
SNG.5.8	please tell him I endured all travails for him.
SNG.5.8	I’ve been pierced through by love,
SNG.5.8	and I will not be turned aside!
SNG.5.9	What love is this?
SNG.5.9	How could you continue to care so deeply for him?
SNG.5.9	Isn’t there another who could steal away your heart?
SNG.5.9	We see now your beauty, more beautiful than all the others.
SNG.5.9	What makes your beloved better than any other?
SNG.5.9	What is it about him
SNG.5.9	that makes you ask us to promise you this?
SNG.5.10	He alone is my beloved.
SNG.5.10	He shines in dazzling splendor yet is still so approachable—
SNG.5.10	without equal as he stands above all others,
SNG.5.10	outstanding among ten thousand!
SNG.5.11	The way he leads me is divine.
SNG.5.11	His leadership—so pure and dignified
SNG.5.11	as he wears his crown of gold.
SNG.5.11	Upon this crown are letters of black written
SNG.5.11	on a background of glory.
SNG.5.12	He sees everything with pure understanding.
SNG.5.12	How beautiful his insights—without distortion.
SNG.5.12	His eyes rest upon the fullness of the river of revelation,
SNG.5.12	flowing so clean and pure.
SNG.5.13	Looking at his gentle face I see such fullness of emotion.
SNG.5.13	Like a lovely garden where fragrant spices grow—
SNG.5.13	what a man!
SNG.5.13	No one speaks words so anointed as this one—
SNG.5.13	words that both pierce and heal,
SNG.5.13	words like lilies dripping with myrrh.
SNG.5.14	See how his hands hold unlimited power!
SNG.5.14	But he never uses it in anger,
SNG.5.14	for he is always holy, displaying his glory.
SNG.5.14	His innermost place is a work of art—
SNG.5.14	so beautiful and bright.
SNG.5.14	How magnificent and noble is this one—
SNG.5.14	covered in majesty!
SNG.5.15	He’s steadfast in all he does.
SNG.5.15	His ways are the ways of righteousness,
SNG.5.15	based on truth and holiness.
SNG.5.15	None can rival him,
SNG.5.15	but all will be amazed by him.
SNG.5.16	Most sweet are his kisses, even his whispers of love.
SNG.5.16	He is delightful in every way
SNG.5.16	and perfect from every viewpoint.
SNG.5.16	If you ask me why I love him so, O brides-to-be,
SNG.5.16	it’s because there is none like him to me.
SNG.5.16	Everything about him fills me with holy desire!
SNG.5.16	And now he is my beloved—my friend forever.
SNG.6.1	O rarest of beauty,
SNG.6.1	where then has your lover gone?
SNG.6.1	We long to see him too.
SNG.6.1	Where may we find him?
SNG.6.1	We will follow you as you seek after him.
SNG.6.2	My lover has gone down
SNG.6.2	into his garden of delight,
SNG.6.2	the place where his spices grow,
SNG.6.2	to feast with those pure in heart.
SNG.6.2	I know we shall find him there.
SNG.6.3	He is within me—I am his garden of delight.
SNG.6.3	I have him fully and now he fully has me!
SNG.6.11	I decided to go down to the valley streams
SNG.6.11	where the orchards of the king grow and mature.
SNG.6.11	I longed to know if hearts were opening.
SNG.6.11	Are the budding vines blooming with new growth?
SNG.6.11	Has their springtime of passionate love arrived?
SNG.6.12	Then suddenly my longings transported me.
SNG.6.12	My divine desire brought me next to my beloved prince,
SNG.6.12	sitting with him in his royal chariot.
SNG.6.12	We were lifted up together!
SNG.6.13	Come back! Return to us, O maiden of his majesty.
SNG.6.13	Dance for us as we gaze upon your beauty.
SNG.6.13	Why would you seek a mere Shulamite like me?
SNG.6.13	Why would you want to see my dance of love?
SNG.7.10	Now I know that I am filled with my beloved
SNG.7.10	and all his desires are fulfilled in me.
SNG.7.11	Come away, my lover.
SNG.7.11	Come with me to the faraway fields.
SNG.7.11	We will run away together to the forgotten places
SNG.7.11	and show them redeeming love.
SNG.7.12	Let us arise and run to the vineyards of your people
SNG.7.12	and see if the budding vines of love are now in full bloom.
SNG.7.12	We will discover if their passion is awakened.
SNG.7.12	There I will display my love for you.
SNG.7.13	The love apples are in bloom,
SNG.7.13	sending forth their fragrance of spring.
SNG.7.13	The rarest of fruits are found at our doors—
SNG.7.13	the new as well as the old.
SNG.7.13	I have stored them for you, my lover-friend!
SNG.8.1	If only I could show everyone
SNG.8.1	this passionate desire I have for you.
SNG.8.1	If only I could express it fully,
SNG.8.1	no matter who was watching me,
SNG.8.1	without shame or embarrassment.
SNG.8.2	I long to bring you to my innermost chamber—
SNG.8.2	this holy sanctuary you have formed within me.
SNG.8.2	O that I might carry you within me.
SNG.8.2	I would give you the spiced wine of my love,
SNG.8.2	this full cup of bliss that we share.
SNG.8.2	We would drink our fill until . . .
SNG.8.3	His left hand cradles my head
SNG.8.3	while his right hand holds me close.
SNG.8.3	We are at rest in this love.
SNG.8.4	Promise me, brides-to-be,
SNG.8.4	by the gentle gazelles and delicate deer,
SNG.8.4	that you’ll not disturb my love until he is ready to arise.
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	My brothers said to me when I was young,
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	But now I have grown and become a bride,
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	and my love for him has made me
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	a tower of passion and contentment for my beloved.
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	I am now a firm wall of protection for others,
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	guarding them from harm.
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	This is how he sees me—I am the one who brings him bliss,
SNG.8.8+SNG.8.9+SNG.8.10	finding favor in his eyes.
SNG.8.11	My bridegroom-king has a vineyard of love
SNG.8.11	made from a multitude of followers.
SNG.8.11	His caretakers of this vineyard
SNG.8.11	have given my beloved their best.
SNG.8.12	But as for my own vineyard of love,
SNG.8.12	I give it all to you forever.
SNG.8.12	And I will give double honor
SNG.8.12	to those who serve my beloved
SNG.8.12	and have watched over my soul.
SNG.8.13	My beloved, one with me in my garden,
SNG.8.13	how marvelous that my friends, the brides-to-be,
SNG.8.13	now hear your voice and song.
SNG.8.13	Let me now hear it again.
SNG.8.14	Come quickly, my beloved.
SNG.8.14	Come be like a dancing deer with me.
SNG.8.14	yes, on the mountains of fragrant spice.
MAT.1.1	This is the scroll of the lineage and birth of Jesus, the Anointed One, the son of David and descendant of Abraham.
MAT.1.2	Abraham had a son named Isaac, who had a son named Jacob, who had a son named Judah 
MAT.1.3	Judah and Tamar had twin sons, Perez and Zerah. Perez had a son named Hezron, who had a son named Ram, 
MAT.1.4	who had a son named Amminadab, who had a son named Nashon, 
MAT.1.5	who had a son named Salmon, who, along with Rahab, had a son named Boaz. Boaz and Ruth had a son named Obed, who was the father of Jesse, 
MAT.1.6	and Jesse had a son named David, 
MAT.1.7	Then David and Bathsheba had a son named Solomon, who had a son named Rehoboam, who had a son named Abijah, who had a son named Asa, 
MAT.1.8	who had a son named Jehoshaphat, who had a son named Joram, who had a son named Uzziah, 
MAT.1.9	who had a son named Jotham, who had a son named Ahaz, who had a son named Hezekiah, 
MAT.1.10	who had a son named Manasseh, who had a son named Amos, who had a son named Josiah, 
MAT.1.11	who was the father of Jeconiah.
MAT.1.11	It was during the days of Jeconiah and his brothers that Israel was taken captive and deported to Babylon. 
MAT.1.12	About the time of their captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah had a son named Shealtiel, who had a son named Zerubbabel, 
MAT.1.13	who had a son named Abiud, who had a son named Eliakim, 
MAT.1.14	who had a son named Azor, who had a son named Zadok, who had a son named Achim, who had a son named Eliud, 
MAT.1.15	who had a son named Eleazar, who had a son named Matthan, who had a son named Jacob, 
MAT.1.16	who was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of Jesus, who is called “the Anointed One.”
MAT.1.17	So from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian captivity, fourteen generation, and from the Babylonian captivity to Christ, fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	This was how Jesus, God’s Anointed One, was born.
MAT.1.18	His mother, Mary, had promised Joseph to be his wife, 
MAT.1.19	Her fiancé, Joseph, was a righteous man full of integrity and he didn’t want to disgrace her, but when he learned of her pregnancy he secretly planned to break the engagement. 
MAT.1.20	While he was still debating with himself about what to do, he fell asleep and had a supernatural dream. An angel from the Lord appeared to him in clear light and said, “Joseph, descendant of David, don’t hesitate to take Mary into your home as your wife, because the power of the Holy Spirit has conceived a child in her womb. 
MAT.1.21	She will give birth to a son and you are to name him ‘Savior,’ for he is destined to give his life to save his people from their sins.”
MAT.1.22	This happened so that what the Lord spoke through his prophet would come true:
MAT.1.23	Listen! A virgin will be pregnant,
MAT.1.23	she will give birth to a Son,
MAT.1.23	and he will be known as “Emmanuel,”
MAT.1.23	which means in Hebrew,
MAT.1.23	“God became one of us.”
MAT.1.24	When Joseph awoke from his dream, he did all that the angel of the Lord instructed him to do. He took Mary to be his wife, 
MAT.1.25	but they refrained from having sex until she gave birth to her son, whom they named “Jesus.”
MAT.2.1	Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus’ birth a group of spiritual priests from the East came to Jerusalem 
MAT.2.2	and inquired of the people, “Where is the child who is born king of the Jewish people? We observed his star rising in the sky and we’ve come to bow before him in worship.”
MAT.2.3	King Herod was shaken to the core when he heard this, and not only him, but all of Jerusalem was disturbed when they heard this news. 
MAT.2.4	So he called a meeting of the Jewish ruling priests and religious scholars, demanding that they tell him where the promised Messiah was prophesied to be born.
MAT.2.5	“He will be born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,” they told him. “Because the prophecy states:
MAT.2.6	And you, little Bethlehem,
MAT.2.6	are not insignificant among the clans of Judah,
MAT.2.6	for out of you will emerge
MAT.2.6	the Shepherd-King of my people Israel!”
MAT.2.7	Then Herod secretly summoned the spiritual priests from the East to ascertain the exact time the star first appeared. 
MAT.2.8	And he told them, “Now go to Bethlehem and carefully look there for the child, and when you’ve found him, report to me so that I can go and bow down and worship him too.”
MAT.2.9	And so they left, and on their way to Bethlehem, suddenly the same star they had seen in the East reappeared! Amazed, they watched as it went ahead of them and stopped directly over the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	And when they saw the star, they were so ecstatic that they shouted and celebrated with unrestrained joy. 
MAT.2.11	When they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, they were overcome. Falling to the ground at his feet they worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure boxes full of gifts and presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	Afterward they returned to their own country by another route because God had warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod.
MAT.2.13	After they had gone, Joseph had another dream. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, “Get up now and flee to Egypt. Take Mary and the little child and stay there until I tell you to leave, for Herod intends to search for the child to kill him.”
MAT.2.14	So that very night he got up and took Jesus and his mother and made their escape to Egypt 
MAT.2.15	and remained there until Herod died. All of this fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through his prophet:
MAT.2.15	I summon my Son out of Egypt.
MAT.2.16	When Herod realized that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated. So he sent soldiers with orders to slaughter every baby boy two years old and younger in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding countryside, based on the time frame he was given from interrogating the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	This fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah:
MAT.2.18	I hear the screams of anguish,
MAT.2.18	weeping, and wailing in Ramah.
MAT.2.18	Rachel is weeping uncontrollably for her children.
MAT.2.18	And she refuses to be comforted,
MAT.2.18	because they are dead and gone.
MAT.2.19	After Herod died, the angel of the Lord appeared again to Joseph in a dream while he was still in Egypt, 
MAT.2.20	saying, “Go back to the land of Israel and take the child and his mother with you, for those who sought to kill the child are dead.”
MAT.2.21	So he awoke and took Jesus and Mary and returned to the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus, Herod’s son, had succeeded him as ruler over all of the territory of Judah, he was afraid to go back. Then he had another dream from God, warning him to avoid that region and instructing him instead to go to the province of Galilee. 
MAT.2.23	So he settled his family in the village of Nazareth, fulfilling the prophecy that he would be known as the “Branch.”
MAT.3.1	It was at this time that John the Baptizer began to preach in the desert of Judah. His message was this: 
MAT.3.2	“The realm of heaven’s kingdom is about to appear—so you’d better keep turning away from evil and turn back to God!”
MAT.3.3	Isaiah was referring to John when he prophesied:
MAT.3.3	A thunderous voice! One will be crying out in the wilderness,
MAT.3.3	“Prepare yourself for the Lord’s coming
MAT.3.3	and level a straight path inside your hearts for him.”
MAT.3.4	Now, John wore clothing made from camel’s hair, tied at his waist with a leather strap, and his food consisted of dried locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	A steady stream of people from Jerusalem, all the surrounding countryside, and the region near the Jordan came out to the wilderness to be baptized by him. 
MAT.3.6	And while they were publicly confessing their sins, he would immerse them in the Jordan River.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many coming from among the wealthy elite of Jewish society and many of the religious leaders known as Pharisees coming to witness the baptism, he began to denounce them, saying, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you 
MAT.3.8	You must prove your repentance by a changed life. 
MAT.3.9	And don’t presume you can get away with merely saying to yourselves, ‘But we’re Abraham’s descendants!’ For I tell you, God can awaken these stones to become sons of Abraham! 
MAT.3.10	The axe is now ready to cut down the trees at their very roots. Every fruitless, rotten tree will be chopped down and thrown into the fire. 
MAT.3.11	Those who repent I baptize with water, but there is coming a Man after me who is more powerful than I am. In fact, I’m not even worthy enough to pick up his sandals. He will submerge you into union with the Spirit of Holiness and with a raging fire! 
MAT.3.12	He comes with a winnowing fork in his hands and comes to his threshing floor to sift what is worthless from what is pure. And he is ready to sweep out his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his granary, but the straw he will burn up with a fire that can’t be extinguished!”
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus left Galilee to come to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 
MAT.3.14	But when he waded into the water, John resisted him, saying, “Why are you doing this? I’m the one who needs to be baptized by you, and yet you come to be baptized by me?”
MAT.3.15	Jesus replied, 
MAT.3.16	And as Jesus rose up out of the water, the heavenly realm opened up over him and he saw the Holy Spirit descend out of the heavens and rest upon him in the form of a dove. 
MAT.3.17	Then suddenly the voice of the Father shouted from the sky, saying, “This is the Son I love, and my greatest delight is in him.”
MAT.4.1	Afterward, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the lonely wilderness in order to reveal his strength against the accuser by going through the ordeal of testing. 
MAT.4.2	And after fasting for forty days, Jesus was extremely weak and famished. 
MAT.4.3	Then the tempter came to entice him to provide food by doing a miracle. So he said to Jesus, “How can you possibly be the Son of God and go hungry? Just order these stones to be turned into loaves of bread.”
MAT.4.4	He answered, 
MAT.4.5	Then the accuser transported Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and perched him at the highest point of the temple 
MAT.4.6	and said to him, “If you’re really God’s Son, jump, and the angels will catch you. For it is written in the Scriptures:
MAT.4.6	He will command his angels to protect you
MAT.4.6	and they will lift you up
MAT.4.6	so that you won’t even bruise your foot on a rock.”
MAT.4.7	Once again Jesus said to him, 
MAT.4.8	And the third time the accuser lifted Jesus up into a very high mountain range and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all the splendor that goes with it.
MAT.4.9	“All of these kingdoms I will give to you,” the accuser said, “if only you will kneel down before me and worship me.”
MAT.4.10	But Jesus said, 
MAT.4.11	At once the accuser left him, and angels suddenly gathered around Jesus to minister to his needs.
MAT.4.12	When Jesus heard that John the Baptizer had been thrown into prison, he went back into Galilee. 
MAT.4.13	Jesus moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum, which is by Lake Galilee in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
MAT.4.14	He did this to make the prophecy of Isaiah come true:
MAT.4.15	Listen, you who live in the land of Zebulun
MAT.4.15	and the land of Naphtali,
MAT.4.15	along the road to the sea
MAT.4.15	and on the other side of the Jordan,
MAT.4.15	and Galilee—the land of non-Jewish peoples!
MAT.4.16	You who spend your days shrouded in darkness
MAT.4.16	can now say, “We have seen a brilliant Light.”
MAT.4.16	And those who live in the dark shadow land of death
MAT.4.16	can now say, “The Dawning Light arises on us.”
MAT.4.17	From that time on Jesus began to proclaim his message with these words: 
MAT.4.18	As he was walking by the shore of Lake Galilee, Jesus noticed two fishermen who were brothers. One was nicknamed Keefa (later called Peter), and the other was Andrew, his brother. Watching as they were casting their nets into the water, 
MAT.4.19	Jesus called out to them and said, 
MAT.4.20	Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.
MAT.4.21	Leaving there, Jesus found three other men sitting in a boat, mending their nets. Two were brothers, Jacob and John, and they were with their father, Zebedee. Jesus called Jacob and John to his side 
MAT.4.22	And at once they left their boat and their father, and began to follow Jesus.
MAT.4.23	Jesus ministered from place to place throughout all of the province of Galilee. He taught in the synagogues, preaching the hope of the kingdom realm and healing every kind of sickness and disease among the people. 
MAT.4.24	His fame spread everywhere! Many people who were in pain and suffering with every kind of illness were brought to Jesus for their healing—epileptics, paralytics, and those tormented by demonic powers were all set free. Everyone who was brought to Jesus was healed!
MAT.4.25	This resulted in massive crowds of people following him, including people from Galilee, Jerusalem, the land of Judah, the region of the Ten Cities known as the Decapolis, and beyond the Jordan River.
MAT.5.1	One day Jesus saw a vast crowd of people gathering to hear him, so he went up the slope of a hill and sat down. With his followers and disciples spread over the hillside, 
MAT.5.2	Jesus began to teach them:
MAT.6.28	“
MAT.7.1	“
MAT.7.28	By the time Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were dazed and overwhelmed by his teaching, 
MAT.7.29	because his words carried such great authority, quite unlike their religious scholars.
MAT.8.1	After he came down from teaching on the hillside, massive crowds began following him. 
MAT.8.2	Suddenly, a leper walked up to Jesus and threw himself down before him in worship and said, “Lord, you have the power to heal me . . . if you really want to.”
MAT.8.3	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the leper and said, 
MAT.8.4	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.5	When Jesus entered the village of Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army approached him, asking for a miracle. 
MAT.8.6	“Lord,” he said, “I have a son who is lying in my home, paralyzed and suffering terribly.”
MAT.8.7	Jesus responded, 
MAT.8.8+MAT.8.9	But the Roman officer interjected, “Lord, who am I to have you come into my house? 
MAT.8.10	Jesus was astonished when he heard this and said to those who were following him, 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus turned to the Roman officer and said, 
MAT.8.14	Then Jesus went into Peter’s home and found Peter’s mother-in-law bedridden, severely ill with a fever. 
MAT.8.15	The moment Jesus touched her hand she was healed! Immediately she got up and began to make dinner for them.
MAT.8.16	That evening the people brought to him many who were demonized. And by Jesus only speaking a word of healing over them, they were totally set free from their torment, and everyone who was sick received their healing! 
MAT.8.17	In doing this, Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:
MAT.8.17	He put upon himself our weaknesses,
MAT.8.17	and he carried away our diseases and made us well.
MAT.8.18	At the sight of large crowds gathering around him, Jesus gave orders to his disciples to get ready to sail back over to the other side of the lake. 
MAT.8.19	Just then, a religious scholar approached him and said, “Teacher, I’ll follow you wherever you go!”
MAT.8.20	Jesus replied, 
MAT.8.21	Then another man spoke up and said, “Lord, I’ll follow you, but first I must take care of my aged father and bury him when he dies.”
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.23	They all got into a boat and began to cross over to the other side of the lake. 
MAT.8.24	Suddenly a violent storm developed, with waves so high the boat was about to be swamped. Yet Jesus continued to sleep soundly. 
MAT.8.25	The disciples woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We’re going to die!”
MAT.8.26	But Jesus reprimanded them. 
MAT.8.27	The disciples were astonished by this miracle and said to one another, “Who is this Man? Even the wind and waves obey his Word.”
MAT.8.28	When they arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes, two demonized men confronted Jesus. They lived among the tombs of a cemetery and were considered so extremely violent that no one felt safe passing through that area. 
MAT.8.29	The demons screamed at Jesus, shouting, “Son of God, what do you want with us? Leave us alone! Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?”
MAT.8.30	There was a large herd of pigs feeding nearby, 
MAT.8.31	so the demons pleaded, “If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs.” 
MAT.8.32	Jesus commanded, 
MAT.8.33	The men who were herding the pigs fled to the nearby town and informed the people of all that had happened to the demonized men. 
MAT.8.34	Then everyone from the town went out to confront Jesus and urged him to go away and leave them alone.
MAT.9.1	Jesus got into the boat and returned to what was considered his hometown, 
MAT.9.2	Just then some people brought a paraplegic man to him, lying on a sleeping mat. When Jesus perceived the strong faith within their hearts, he said to the paralyzed man, 
MAT.9.3	These words prompted some of the religious scholars who were present to think, “Why, that’s nothing but blasphemy!”
MAT.9.4	Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts, and said to them, 
MAT.9.7	Immediately the man sprang to his feet and left for home.
MAT.9.8	When the crowds witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God because he had given such authority to human beings.
MAT.9.9	As Jesus left Capernaum he came upon a tax-collecting station, where a traitorous Jew was busy at his work, collecting taxes for the Romans. His name was Matthew. 
MAT.9.10	Later, Jesus went to Matthew’s house and made himself at home. Many other tax collectors and outcasts of society were invited to eat with Jesus and his disciples.
MAT.9.11	When those known as the Pharisees saw what was happening, they were indignant, and they kept asking Jesus’ disciples, “Why would your Master dine with such lowlifes?”
MAT.9.12	When Jesus overheard this, he spoke up and said, 
MAT.9.13	Then he added, 
MAT.9.14	The disciples of John the Baptizer approached Jesus with this question: “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast regularly, but not your disciples?”
MAT.9.15	Jesus replied, 
MAT.9.18	While Jesus was still speaking, an influential Jewish leader approached and knelt before him, saying, “Help me! My daughter has just died. Please come and place your hand upon her so that she will live again.” 
MAT.9.19	So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him.
MAT.9.20	Suddenly, a woman came from behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his prayer shawl 
MAT.9.21	For she kept saying to herself, “If I could only touch his prayer shawl I would be healed.”
MAT.9.22	Just then Jesus turned around and looked at her and said, 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus finally entered the home of the Jewish leader, he saw a noisy crowd of mourners, wailing and playing a funeral dirge on their flutes. 
MAT.9.24	He told them, 
MAT.9.25	After he made the crowd go outside, he went into the girl’s room and gently took hold of her hand. She immediately stood to her feet! 
MAT.9.26	And the news of this incredible miracle spread everywhere.
MAT.9.27	As Jesus left the house, two blind men began following him, shouting out over and over, “Son of David, show us mercy and heal us!” 
MAT.9.28	And they followed him right into the house where Jesus was staying. So Jesus asked them, 
MAT.9.28	They replied, “Yes Lord, we believe!”
MAT.9.29	Then Jesus put his hands over their eyes and said, 
MAT.9.30	And instantly their eyes opened—they could see! Then Jesus warned them sternly, 
MAT.9.31	But unable to contain themselves, they went out and spread the news everywhere!
MAT.9.32	While they were leaving, some people brought before Jesus a man with a demon spirit who couldn’t speak. 
MAT.9.33	Jesus cast the demon out of him, and immediately the man began to speak 
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees kept saying, “The chief of demons is helping him drive out demons.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus walked throughout the region with the joyful message of God’s kingdom realm. He taught in their meeting houses, and wherever he went he demonstrated God’s power by healing every kind of disease and illness.
MAT.9.36	When he saw the vast crowds of people, Jesus’ heart was deeply moved with compassion, because they seemed weary and helpless, like wandering sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	He turned to his disciples and said, 
MAT.10.1	Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them authority to cast out demons and to heal every sickness and every disease.
MAT.10.2	Now, these are the names of the first twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is nicknamed Peter, and Andrew, his brother. And then Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee. 
MAT.10.3	Next were Phillip and Bartholomew; then Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus; 
MAT.10.4	Simon, the former member of the Zealot party, and Judas the locksmith, who eventually betrayed Jesus.
MAT.10.5	Jesus commissioned these twelve to go out 
MAT.10.32	“
MAT.11.1	After Jesus finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he went on to minister in different villages throughout the region.
MAT.11.2	Now, while John the Baptizer was in prison, he heard about what Christ was doing among the people, so he sent his disciples to ask him this question: 
MAT.11.3	“Are you really the one prophesied would come, or should we still wait for another?”
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.11.5	‘
MAT.11.7	As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. 
MAT.11.20	Then Jesus began to openly denounce the cities where he had done most of his mighty miracles, because the people failed to turn away from sin and return to God. 
MAT.11.21	He said, 
MAT.11.25	Then Jesus exclaimed, 
MAT.12.1	One Saturday, on the day of rest, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain and rubbed them in their hands to eat. 
MAT.12.2	But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples shouldn’t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!”
MAT.12.3	Jesus responded, 
MAT.12.9	Then Jesus left them and went into the synagogue where 
MAT.12.10	he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand. The fault-finding Pharisees asked Jesus, “Is it permissible to perform a work of healing on the Sabbath, 
MAT.12.11	He answered them, 
MAT.12.13	Then he turned to the man and said, “Hold out your hand!” And as he stretched it out, it was restored, exactly like the other.
MAT.12.14	Immediately the Pharisees went out and started to scheme about how they would do away with him. 
MAT.12.15	Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he left by another way. Massive crowds followed him from there, and he healed all who were sick. 
MAT.12.16	However, he sternly warned them not to tell others or disclose his real identity, 
MAT.12.17	in order to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah:
MAT.12.18	Take a careful look at my servant, my chosen one.
MAT.12.18	I love him dearly
MAT.12.18	and I find all my delight in him.
MAT.12.18	I will breathe my Spirit upon him
MAT.12.18	and he will decree justice to the nations.
MAT.12.19	He will not quarrel or be found yelling in public.
MAT.12.20	He won’t brush aside the bruised and broken.
MAT.12.20	He will be gentle with the weak and feeble,
MAT.12.20	until his victory releases justice.
MAT.12.21	And the fame of his name
MAT.12.21	will birth hope among the people.
MAT.12.22	Then a man was brought before Jesus who had a demon spirit that made him both blind and unable to speak. Jesus healed him instantly, and he could see and talk again! 
MAT.12.23	The crowds went wild with amazement as they witnessed this miracle. And they kept saying to one another, “Could this man be the Messiah?”
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees overheard what the people were saying about the miracle, they said, “He casts out demons by the power of Satan, the prince of demons!”
MAT.12.25	Now, Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and motives, so he confronted them by telling them this parable:
MAT.12.38	Then a few Jewish scholars and Pharisees spoke up and said, “Teacher, why don’t you perform a miraculous sign for us.”
MAT.12.39	Jesus replied, 
MAT.12.46	While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking for him to come out and speak with them. 
MAT.12.47	Then someone said, “Look, your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to have a word with you.” 
MAT.12.48	But Jesus just looked at him and said, 
MAT.12.49	Then gesturing to the disciples gathered around him, he said, 
MAT.13.1	Later that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeshore to teach the people. 
MAT.13.2	Soon, there were so many people surrounding him that he had to teach sitting in a boat while the large crowd stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	He taught them many things by using stories, parables that would illustrate spiritual truths, saying:
MAT.13.10	Then his disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Why do you always speak to people in these hard-to-understand parables?”
MAT.13.11	He explained, 
MAT.13.24	Then Jesus taught them another parable:
MAT.13.31	Then Jesus taught them another parable:
MAT.13.33	Then he taught them another parable:
MAT.13.34	Whenever Jesus addressed the crowds, he always spoke in allegories. He never spoke without using parables. 
MAT.13.35	He did this in order to fulfill the prophecy:
MAT.13.35	I will speak to you in allegories.
MAT.13.35	I will reveal secrets that have been concealed
MAT.13.35	since before the foundation of the world.
MAT.13.36	Jesus left the crowds and went inside the house 
MAT.13.37	He answered, 
MAT.13.51	“Yes,” they replied.
MAT.13.52	He responded, 
MAT.13.53	Right after Jesus taught this series of parables, he left from there.
MAT.13.54	When Jesus arrived in his hometown 
MAT.13.55	Isn’t he just the wood-worker’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary, and his four brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah? 
MAT.13.56	And don’t his sisters all live here in Nazareth? How did he get all this revelation and power?” 
MAT.13.57	And the people became offended and began to turn against him.
MAT.13.57	Jesus said, 
MAT.13.58	And their great unbelief kept him from doing any mighty miracles 
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod, the Roman ruler over Galilee, heard reports about Jesus. 
MAT.14.2	He told his officials, “This man has to be John the Baptizer who has come back from the dead. That’s why he has this power to work miracles.”
MAT.14.3	For Herod had earlier arrested John for confronting him over taking the wife of his brother Philip. He had John thrown in prison and placed in chains 
MAT.14.4	because John had repeatedly said to him, “It’s not legal or proper for you to be married to Herodias, your sister-in-law!” 
MAT.14.5	So Herod wanted John dead, but he was afraid of the crowds who flocked to John because they considered him to be a prophet.
MAT.14.6	During Herod’s birthday celebration, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and all his distinguished guests, which greatly pleased the king. 
MAT.14.7	So he said to her in front of them all, “I give you my oath, ask of me anything you wish and it will be yours!”
MAT.14.8	Because she had been instructed by her mother, she said, “I want the head of John the Baptizer here on a platter!”
MAT.14.9	This grieved the king, but because of his oath in front of all of his guests, 
MAT.14.10	he had John beheaded in prison. 
MAT.14.11	They brought in his head and displayed it to her on a platter, and she then had it shown to her mother.
MAT.14.12	John’s disciples went into the prison and carried his body away and buried it. Then they left to find Jesus and tell him what had happened.
MAT.14.13	On hearing this, Jesus slipped away privately by boat to be alone. But when the crowds discovered he had sailed away, they emerged from all the nearby towns and followed him on foot. 
MAT.14.14	So when Jesus landed he had a huge crowd waiting for him. Seeing so many people, his heart was deeply moved with compassion toward them, so he healed all the sick who were in the crowd.
MAT.14.15	Later that afternoon the disciples came to Jesus and said, “It’s going to be dark soon and the people are hungry, but there’s nothing to eat here in this desolate place. You should send the crowds away to the nearby villages to buy themselves some food.”
MAT.14.16	 Jesus responded. 
MAT.14.17	They answered, “But all we have is five barley loaves and two fish.”
MAT.14.18	 Jesus replied. 
MAT.14.19	Then he had everyone sit down on the grass as he took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up into heaven, gave thanks to God, and broke the bread into pieces. He then gave it to his disciples, who in turn gave it to the crowds. 
MAT.14.20	And everyone ate until they were satisfied, 
MAT.14.21	There were about five thousand men who were fed, in addition to many women and children!
MAT.14.22	As soon as the people were fed, Jesus told his disciples to get into their boat and to go to the other side of the lake while he stayed behind to dismiss the people. 
MAT.14.23	After the crowds dispersed, Jesus went up into the hills to pray. And as night fell he was there praying alone with God.
MAT.14.24	But the disciples, who were now in the middle of the lake, ran into trouble, for their boat was tossed about by the high winds and heavy seas.
MAT.14.25	At about four o’clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the waves! 
MAT.14.26	When the disciples saw him walking on top of the water, they were terrified and screamed, “A ghost!”
MAT.14.27	Then Jesus said, 
MAT.14.28	Peter shouted out, “Lord, if it’s really you, then have me join you on the water!”
MAT.14.29	 Jesus replied.
MAT.14.29	So Peter stepped out onto the water and began to walk toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he realized how high the waves were, he became frightened and started to sink. “Save me, Lord!” he cried out.
MAT.14.31	Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and lifted him up and said, 
MAT.14.32	And the very moment they both stepped into the boat, the raging wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	Then all the disciples crouched down before him and worshiped Jesus. They said in adoration, “You are truly the Son of God!”
MAT.14.34	After they crossed over and landed at Gennesaret, 
MAT.14.35	the people living there quickly recognized who he was. They were quick to spread the news throughout the surrounding region that Jesus had come to them. 
MAT.14.36	So they brought him all their sick, begging him to let them touch the fringe of his robe. And everyone who touched it was instantly healed!
MAT.15.1	Then the Pharisees and religious scholars came from Jerusalem and approached Jesus with this question: 
MAT.15.2	“Why do your disciples ignore the traditions of our elders? For example, they don’t ceremonially wash their hands before they eat bread.”
MAT.15.3	Jesus answered, 
MAT.15.10	Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said, 
MAT.15.12	Then his disciples approached him and said, “Don’t you know that what you just said offended the Pharisees?”
MAT.15.13	Jesus replied, 
MAT.15.15	Peter spoke up and said, “Will you explain to us what you mean by your parable?”
MAT.15.16	Jesus said, 
MAT.15.21	Then Jesus left and went north into the non-Jewish region of Lebanon. 
MAT.15.22	He encountered there a Canaanite woman who screamed out to him, “Lord, Son of David, show mercy to me! My daughter is horribly afflicted by a demon that torments her.” 
MAT.15.23	But Jesus never answered her. So his disciples said to him, “Why do you ignore this woman who is crying out to us?”
MAT.15.24	Jesus said, 
MAT.15.25	But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!”
MAT.15.26	Jesus responded, 
MAT.15.27	“You’re right, Lord,” she replied. “But even puppies get to eat the crumbs that fall from the prince’s table.”
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered her, 
MAT.15.29	After leaving Lebanon, Jesus went to Lake Galilee and climbed a hill nearby and sat down. 
MAT.15.30	Then huge crowds of people streamed up the hill, bringing with them the lame, blind, deformed, mute, and many others in need of healing. They laid them at Jesus’ feet and he healed them all.
MAT.15.31	And the crowds marveled with rapture and amazement, astounded over the things they were witnessing with their own eyes! The lame were walking, the mute were speaking, the crippled were made well, and the blind could see. 
MAT.15.32	Jesus called his disciples to himself and said, 
MAT.15.33	So the disciples said to him, “Where in the world are we going to find enough food in this desolate place to feed this crowd?”
MAT.15.34	 Jesus asked.
MAT.15.34	“Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”
MAT.15.35	So he gave the order, 
MAT.15.36	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, who then distributed the food to the crowds. 
MAT.15.37	When everyone was full and satisfied, they gathered up the leftovers. And from what was once seven loaves and a few fish, they filled seven baskets! 
MAT.15.38	There were four thousand men who ate the food Jesus multiplied, and even more including the women and children!
MAT.15.39	After dismissing the crowd, Jesus got into the boat and crossed over to the region of Magdala.
MAT.16.1	One day some of the Pharisees and those of the Jewish sect known as the Sadducees approached Jesus, insisting that he prove to them that he was the Messiah. “Show us a supernatural sign from heaven,” they demanded.
MAT.16.2	Jesus answered, 
MAT.16.4	 Then he turned away and left them.
MAT.16.5	Later, as Jesus and his disciples crossed over to the other side of Lake Galilee, the disciples realized they had forgotten to bring any loaves of bread. 
MAT.16.6	Jesus spoke up and said, 
MAT.16.7	Thinking Jesus was scolding them over not bringing bread, they whispered among themselves. 
MAT.16.8	Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.16.12	Then finally they realized he wasn’t talking about yeast found in bread, but the error of the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples this question: 
MAT.16.14	They answered, “Some are convinced you are John the Baptizer, others say you are Elijah reincarnated, or Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”
MAT.16.15	 Jesus asked.
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter spoke up and said, “You are the Anointed One, the Son of the living God!”
MAT.16.17	Jesus replied, 
MAT.16.20	He then gave his disciples strict orders not to tell anyone that he was God’s Anointed One.
MAT.16.21	From then on Jesus began to clearly reveal to his disciples that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer injustice from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.
MAT.16.22	Peter took him aside to correct him privately. He reprimanded Jesus over and over, saying to him, “God forbid, Master! Spare yourself. You must never let this happen to you!”
MAT.16.23	Jesus turned to Peter and said, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.17.1	Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone. 
MAT.17.2	Then Jesus’ appearance was dramatically altered. A radiant light as bright as the sun poured from his face. And his clothing became luminescent—dazzling like lightning. He was transfigured before their very eyes. 
MAT.17.3	Then suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared, and they spoke with Jesus.
MAT.17.4	Peter blurted out, “Lord, it’s so wonderful that we are all here together! If you want, I’ll construct three shrines, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
MAT.17.5	But while Peter was still speaking, a radiant cloud composed of light spread over them, enveloping them all. And God’s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, “This is my dearly loved Son, the constant focus of my delight. Listen to him!”
MAT.17.6	The three disciples were dazed and terrified by this phenomenon, and they fell facedown to the ground. 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus walked over and touched them, saying, 
MAT.17.8	When they finally opened their eyes and looked around, they saw no one else there but Jesus.
MAT.17.9	As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them, 
MAT.17.10	His disciples asked him, “Why do all the religious scholars insist that Elijah must first appear before the Anointed One comes?”
MAT.17.11	He answered them, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples realized that Jesus was referring to John the Baptizer all along.
MAT.17.14	They came to where a large crowd had gathered 
MAT.17.15	and said, “Lord, please show your tender mercy toward my son. 
MAT.17.16	I brought him to your followers, but they weren’t able to heal him.”
MAT.17.17	Jesus replied, 
MAT.17.18	Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was instantly healed!
MAT.17.19	Later the disciples came to him privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we cast out the demon?”
MAT.17.20	He told them, 
MAT.17.22	When they all gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.17.23	 When the disciples heard these words they were devastated.
MAT.17.24	After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, “Does your teacher pay the tax for the upkeep of the temple, like the rest of us?”
MAT.17.25	“Of course he does,” Peter answered.
MAT.17.25	When Peter walked into the house, and before he had a chance to speak, Jesus spoke up and said, 
MAT.17.26	“From his subjects,” Peter answered.
MAT.17.26	Jesus replied, 
MAT.18.1	At that time the disciples came to ask Jesus, “Who is considered to be the greatest in heaven’s kingdom realm?”
MAT.18.2	Jesus called a little one to his side and said to them, 
MAT.18.21	Later Peter approached Jesus and said, “How many times do I have to forgive my fellow believer who keeps offending me? Seven times?”
MAT.18.22	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.1	After Jesus finished teaching them, he left Galilee and made his way toward the district of Judea, east of the Jordan River. 
MAT.19.2	Massive crowds followed him and he healed all who were sick. 
MAT.19.3	The Pharisees were intent on putting Jesus to the test with difficult questions, so they approached him and asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
MAT.19.4	 Jesus replied. 
MAT.19.7	They responded, “So then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and it would be lawful?”
MAT.19.8	Jesus said, 
MAT.19.10	His disciples spoke up and said, “If this is the standard, then it seems better to never get married.”
MAT.19.13	Then they brought little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them, bless them, and pray for them. But the disciples scolded those who brought the children, saying, “Don’t bother him with this now!”
MAT.19.14	Jesus overheard them and said, 
MAT.19.15	Then he laid his hands on each of them and went on his way.
MAT.19.16	 approached Jesus and bowed before him, saying, “Wonderful teacher—is there a good work I have to do to obtain eternal life?”
MAT.19.17	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.18	“Which ones?” he asked.
MAT.19.18	Jesus said, 
MAT.19.20	“But I’ve always obeyed every one of them without fail,” the young man replied. “What else do I lack?”
MAT.19.21	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.19.22	When the young man heard these words, he walked away angry, for he was extremely wealthy.
MAT.19.23	Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, 
MAT.19.25	Stunned and bewildered, his disciples asked, “Then who in the world can possibly be saved?”
MAT.19.26	Looking straight into their eyes, Jesus replied, 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter blurted out, “Here we are. We’ve given up everything to follow you. What reward will there be for us?”
MAT.19.28	Jesus responded, 
MAT.20.17	Jesus was about to go to Jerusalem, so he took his twelve disciples aside privately and said to them, 
MAT.20.20	The wife of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons, Jacob and John. She knelt before him and asked him for a favor.
MAT.20.21	He said to her, 
MAT.20.21	She answered, “Make the decree that these, my sons, will rule with you in your kingdom—one sitting on your right hand, one on your left.”
MAT.20.22	Jesus replied, 
MAT.20.22	They answered him, “Yes, we are able.”
MAT.20.23	 Jesus told them. 
MAT.20.24	The other ten disciples were listening to all of this, and a jealous anger arose among them against the two brothers. 
MAT.20.25	Jesus, knowing their thoughts, called them to his side and said, 
MAT.20.29	As Jesus approached Jericho an immense crowd gathered and followed him. 
MAT.20.30	And there were two blind men sitting on the roadside. When they heard that it was Jesus passing by, they shouted, “Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!” 
MAT.20.31	Those in the crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet. But the blind men screamed out even louder, “Jesus, Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!”
MAT.20.32	So Jesus stopped and had them brought to him. He asked them, 
MAT.20.33	They said, “Lord, we want to see! Heal us!”
MAT.20.34	Jesus was deeply moved with compassion toward them. So he touched their eyes, and instantly they could see! Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.1	Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem they arrived at the place of the stables near the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead, saying, 
MAT.21.2	“As soon as you enter the village, you will find a donkey tethered along with her young colt. Untie them both and bring them to me. 
MAT.21.3	And if anyone stops you and asks, ‘What are you doing?’ just tell them, ‘The Lord of All needs them,’ and he will let you take them.”
MAT.21.4	All of this happened to fulfill the prophecy:
MAT.21.5	Tell Zion’s daughter:
MAT.21.5	“Look, your King arrives!
MAT.21.5	He’s coming to you full of gentleness,
MAT.21.5	sitting on a donkey, riding on a donkey’s colt.”
MAT.21.6	So the two disciples went on ahead and did as Jesus had instructed them. 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and her colt to him and placed their cloaks and prayer shawls on the colt, and Jesus rode on it.
MAT.21.8	Then an exceptionally large crowd gathered and carpeted the road before him with their cloaks and prayer shawls. Others cut down branches from trees to spread in his path. 
MAT.21.9	Jesus rode in the center of the procession—crowds going before him and crowds coming behind him, and they all shouted, “Bring the victory, Lord, Son of David! He comes with the blessings of being sent from the Lord Yahweh! We celebrate with praises to God in the highest!”
MAT.21.10	As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the people went wild with excitement—the entire city was thrown into an uproar! 
MAT.21.11	Some asked, “Who is this man?” And the crowds shouted back, “This is Jesus! He’s the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee!”
MAT.21.12	Upon entering Jerusalem Jesus went directly into the temple area and drove away all the merchants who were buying and selling their goods. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the stands of those selling doves. 
MAT.21.13	And he said to them, 
MAT.21.14	Then the blind and the crippled came into the temple courts, and Jesus healed them all. And the children circled around him shouting out, “Blessings and praises to the Son of David!”
MAT.21.15	But when the chief priests and religious scholars heard the children shouting and saw all the wonderful miracles of healing, they were furious. 
MAT.21.16	They said to Jesus, “Don’t you hear what these children are saying? This is not right!”
MAT.21.16	Jesus answered, 
MAT.21.17	Jesus then left at once for the nearby village of Bethany, where he spent the night.
MAT.21.18	While walking back into the city the next morning, he got hungry. 
MAT.21.19	He noticed a lone fig tree by the side of the path and walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none—he found only leaves. So he spoke to the fig tree and said, 
MAT.21.20	Astonished, his disciples asked, “How did you make this fig tree instantly wither and die?”
MAT.21.21	Jesus replied, 
MAT.21.23	After this Jesus went into the temple courts and taught the people. The leading priests and Jewish elders approached him and interrupted him and asked, “By what power do you do these things, and who granted you the authority to teach here?”
MAT.21.24	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.21.26	They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, “How should we answer this? If we say from heaven, he will say to us, ‘Then why didn’t you respond to John and believe what he said?’ But if we deny that God gave him his authority, we’ll be mobbed by the people, for they’re convinced that John was God’s prophet.”
MAT.21.27	So they finally answered, “We don’t know.”
MAT.21.27	 he replied.
MAT.21.28	Jesus said to his critics, 
MAT.21.31	They answered him, “The first one.”
MAT.21.31	Jesus said, 
MAT.21.33	 Jesus said. 
MAT.21.41	They answered, “He will bring a horrible death to those who did this evil and he will completely destroy them. Then he’ll lease his vineyard to different tenants who will be faithful to give him the portion he deserves.”
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.45	When the leading priests and the Pharisees realized that the parable was referring to them, they were 
MAT.21.46	outraged and wanted to arrest him at once. But they were afraid of the reaction of the crowds, because the people considered him to be a prophet.
MAT.22.1	As was his custom, Jesus continued to teach the people by using allegories. 
MAT.22.2	He illustrated the reality of heaven’s kingdom realm by saying, 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees came together to make a plan to entrap Jesus with his own words. 
MAT.22.16	So they sent some of their disciples together with some staunch supporters of Herod. They said to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that you’re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God’s ways. We can clearly see that you’re not one who speaks only to win the people’s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences. 
MAT.22.17	So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us Jews to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
MAT.22.18	Jesus knew the malice that was hidden behind their cunning ploy and said, 
MAT.22.19	 So they brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax. 
MAT.22.21	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MAT.22.21	Jesus said, 
MAT.22.22	The imposters were baffled in the presence of all the people and were unable to trap Jesus with his words. So they left, stunned by Jesus’ words.
MAT.22.23	Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question: 
MAT.22.24	“Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother’s family line. 
MAT.22.25	Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, leaving his widow for his brother. 
MAT.22.26	The second brother married and also died, and the third also. This was repeated down to the seventh brother, 
MAT.22.27	when finally the woman also died. So here’s our dilemma: 
MAT.22.28	Which of the seven brothers will be the woman’s husband when she’s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?”
MAT.22.29	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.22.33	When the crowds heard this they were dazed, stunned over such wisdom!
MAT.22.34	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they called a meeting to discuss how to trap Jesus. 
MAT.22.35	Then one of them, a religious scholar, posed this question to test him: 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”
MAT.22.37	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.22.41	While all the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus took the opportunity to pose a question of his own: 
MAT.22.42	“The son of David,” they replied.
MAT.22.43	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.22.46	No one could come up with an answer. And from that day on none of the Pharisees had the courage to question Jesus any longer.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus addressed both the crowds and his disciples and said, 
MAT.24.1	As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, his disciples came to him and pointed out the beautiful aspects of the architecture of the temple structures. 
MAT.24.2	And Jesus turned to them and said, 
MAT.24.3	Later, when they arrived at the Mount of Olives, his disciples came privately to where he was sitting and said, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what supernatural sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?”
MAT.24.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.24.15	 [let the reader learn], 
MAT.26.1	After Jesus had completed his teachings, he said to his disciples, 
MAT.26.3	Meanwhile, the prominent priests and religious leaders of the nation were gathered in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas. 
MAT.26.4	That’s when they made their decision to secretly have Jesus captured and killed. 
MAT.26.5	But they all agreed, “We can’t do this during the Passover celebrations or we could have a riot on our hands.”
MAT.26.6+MAT.26.7	Then Jesus went to Bethany, to the home of Simon, a man Jesus had healed of leprosy. A woman came into the house, holding an alabaster flask filled with fragrant and expensive oil. 
MAT.26.8	When the disciples saw this, they were offended. “What a total waste!” they grumbled. 
MAT.26.9	“We could have sold it for a great deal of money and given it to the poor.”
MAT.26.10	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, 
MAT.26.14	One of the twelve apostles, Judas the locksmith, went to the leading priests 
MAT.26.15	and said, “How much are you willing to pay me to betray Jesus into your hands?” They agreed to pay him thirty silver coins. 
MAT.26.16	Immediately Judas began to scheme and look for an opportunity to betray him.
MAT.26.17	On the first day of Passover, the day when any bread made with yeast was removed from every Jewish home, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where should we prepare the Passover meal for you?”
MAT.26.18	He answered them, 
MAT.26.19	The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover meal. 
MAT.26.20	When evening came he took his place at the table and dined with the Twelve. 
MAT.26.21	While they were eating, Jesus spoke up and said, 
MAT.26.22	Feeling deeply hurt by these words, one after another asked him, “You don’t mean me, do you?”
MAT.26.23	He answered, 
MAT.26.25	Then finally, Judas the traitor spoke up and asked him, “Teacher, perhaps it is I?”
MAT.26.25	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.26	As they ate, Jesus took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to his disciples. He said to them, 
MAT.26.27	Then taking the cup of wine and giving praises to the Father, he entered into covenant with them, saying, 
MAT.26.30	Then they sang a psalm and left for the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Along the way Jesus said to them, 
MAT.26.33	Then Peter spoke up and said, “Even if all the rest lose their faith and fall away, I will still be beside you, Jesus!”
MAT.26.34	 Jesus said. 
MAT.26.35	Peter replied, “I absolutely will never deny you, even if I have to die with you!” And all the others said the same thing.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called “The Oil Press.” He told them, 
MAT.26.37	He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him. However, an intense feeling of great sorrow plunged his soul into deep sorrow and agony. 
MAT.26.38	And he said to them, 
MAT.26.39	Then he walked a short distance away, and overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground and prayed, 
MAT.26.40	Later, he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him, 
MAT.26.42	Then he left them for a second time to pray in solitude. 
MAT.26.43	He came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open. 
MAT.26.44	So he left them and went away to pray the same prayer for the third time.
MAT.26.45	When he returned again to his disciples, he awoke them, saying, 
MAT.26.47	At that moment Judas, his once-trusted disciple, appeared, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests and Jewish religious leaders. 
MAT.26.48	Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, “Jesus is the one whom I will kiss. So grab him!”
MAT.26.49	Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, “Shalom, Rabbi,” and he kissed him 
MAT.26.50	 Jesus said, 
MAT.26.50	Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him. 
MAT.26.51	But one of the disciples pulled out a dagger and swung it at the servant of the high priest, slashing off his ear. 
MAT.26.52	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.55	Then Jesus turned to the mob and said, 
MAT.26.56	At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.
MAT.26.57	Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the chief priest, and to a meeting where the religious scholars and the supreme Jewish council were already assembled. 
MAT.26.58	Now, Peter had followed the mob from a distance all the way to the chief priest’s courtyard. And after entering, he sat with the servants of the chief priest who had gathered there, waiting to see how things would unfold. 
MAT.26.59	The chief priests and the entire supreme Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to find false charges that they could bring against Jesus, because they were looking for a reason to put him to death.
MAT.26.60	Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated. Finally two men came forward 
MAT.26.61	and declared, “This man said, ‘I can destroy God’s temple and build it again in three days!’ ”
MAT.26.62	Then the chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they’re saying about you true?” 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus remained silent before them. So the chief priest said to him, “I charge you under oath—in the name of the living God, tell us once and for all if you are the anointed Messiah, the Son of God!”
MAT.26.64	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.26.65	This infuriated the chief priest, and as an act of outrage, he tore his robe and shouted, “What blasphemy! No more witnesses are needed, for you heard this grievous blasphemy.” 
MAT.26.66	Turning to the council he said, “Now, what is your verdict?”
MAT.26.66	“He’s guilty and deserves the death penalty!” they answered. 
MAT.26.67	Then they spat on his face and slapped him. Others struck him over and over with their fists. 
MAT.26.68	Then they taunted him by saying, “Oh, Anointed One, prophesy to us! Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next?”
MAT.26.69	Meanwhile, Peter was still sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, “I recognize you. You were with Jesus the Galilean.”
MAT.26.70	In front of everyone Peter denied it and said, “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.”
MAT.26.71	Later, as he stood near the gateway of the courtyard, another servant girl noticed him and said, “I know this man is a follower of Jesus the Nazarene!”
MAT.26.72	Once again, Peter denied it, and with an oath he said, “I tell you, I don’t know the man!”
MAT.26.73	A short time later, those standing nearby approached Peter and said, “We know you’re one of his disciples—we can tell by your speech. Your Galilean accent gives you away!”
MAT.26.74	Peter denied it, and using profanity he said, “I don’t know the man!” At that very moment the sound of a crowing rooster pierced the night. 
MAT.26.75	Then Peter remembered the prophecy of Jesus, “Before the rooster crows you will have denied me three times.” With a shattered heart, Peter went out of the courtyard, sobbing with bitter tears.
MAT.27.1	Before dawn that morning, all the chief priests and religious leaders resolved to take action against Jesus and decided that he should be executed. 
MAT.27.2	So they bound him with chains and led him away to Pilate, the Roman governor.
MAT.27.3	Now, when Judas, the betrayer, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to death, remorse filled his heart. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and religious leaders, 
MAT.27.4	saying, “I have sinned because I have betrayed an innocent man.”
MAT.27.4	They replied, “Why are you bothering us? That’s your problem.”
MAT.27.5	Then Judas flung the silver coins inside the temple and went out and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, “We can’t keep this, for it’s unlawful to put blood money into the temple treasury.” 
MAT.27.7	So after some deliberation, they decided to purchase the potter’s field 
MAT.27.8	That’s why that land has been called “The Field of Blood.” 
MAT.27.9	This fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah:
MAT.27.9	They took the thirty pieces of silver,
MAT.27.9	the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel,
MAT.27.9	the price of a precious man,
MAT.27.10	And with the silver they bought the potter’s field,
MAT.27.10	as the Lord directed.
MAT.27.11	As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor, Pilate asked him, “So, you are really the king of the Jews?”
MAT.27.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.27.12	Then he was slandered and accused by the chief priests and religious leaders, but he remained silent.
MAT.27.13	Pilate said, “Don’t you hear these allegations?” 
MAT.27.14	But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the great astonishment of Pilate.
MAT.27.15	Now, every year at Passover it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people—anyone they wanted. 
MAT.27.16	And at that time, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Jesus Barabbas. 
MAT.27.17	So as the crowds of people assembled outside of Pilate’s residence, he went out and offered them a choice. He asked them, “Who would you want me to release to you today, Jesus who is called Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Anointed One?” 
MAT.27.18	(Now, Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of their bitter jealousy.)
MAT.27.19	Just then, as Pilate was presiding over the tribunal, his wife sent him an urgent message: “Don’t harm that holy man, for I suffered a horrible nightmare last night about him!”
MAT.27.20	Meanwhile, the chief priest and the religious leaders were inciting the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and to have Jesus killed. 
MAT.27.21	So Pilate asked them again, “Which of the two men would you like me to release for you?”
MAT.27.21	They shouted, “Barabbas.”
MAT.27.22	Pilate asked them, “Then what would you have me to do with Jesus who is called the Anointed One?”
MAT.27.22	They all shouted back, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.23	“Why?” Pilate asked. “What has he done wrong?”
MAT.27.23	But they kept shouting out, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.24	When Pilate realized that a riot was about to break out and that it was useless to try to reason with the crowd, he sent for a basin of water. After washing his hands in front of the people, he said, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. The responsibility for his death is now yours!”
MAT.27.25	And the crowd replied, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”
MAT.27.26	So he released Barabbas to the people. He ordered that Jesus be beaten with a whip made of leather straps embedded with metal, and afterward be crucified. 
MAT.27.27	Then the guards took him into their military compound, where a detachment of nearly six hundred soldiers surrounded him.
MAT.27.28	They stripped off his clothing and placed a scarlet robe on him to make fun of him. 
MAT.27.29	Then they braided a crown of thorns and set it on his head. After placing a reed staff in his right hand, they knelt down before him and irreverently mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	Then they spat in his face and took the reed staff from his hand and hit him repeatedly on his head, 
MAT.27.31	When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the scarlet robe and put his own clothes back on him and led him away to be crucified. 
MAT.27.32	And as they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, from Libya, and compelled him to carry the cross for Jesus.
MAT.27.33	They brought Jesus to Golgotha, which means “Skull Hill.” 
MAT.27.34	And there the soldiers offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
MAT.27.35	Then they crucified Jesus, nailing his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them. 
MAT.27.36	And the soldiers stood there to watch what would happen and to keep guard over him. 
MAT.27.37	Above his head they placed a sign that read, “This is Jesus of Nazareth, King of Israel.”
MAT.27.38	Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him. 
MAT.27.39	And those who passed by shook their heads and spitefully ridiculed him, 
MAT.27.40	saying, “We heard you boast that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days! Why don’t you save yourself now? If you’re really God’s Son, come down from the cross!”
MAT.27.41	Even the ruling priests, with the Jewish scholars and religious leaders, joined in the mockery 
MAT.27.42	and kept on saying, “He saved others, but he can’t even save himself! Israel’s king, is he? He should pull out the nails and come down from the cross right now; then we’ll believe in him! 
MAT.27.43	He says he puts all his trust in God, so let’s see if it’s true, and see if God really wants to rescue his ‘favorite son’!”
MAT.27.44	Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling their insults on him.
MAT.27.45	For three hours, beginning at noon, darkness came over the earth. 
MAT.27.46	And at three o’clock Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic, 
MAT.27.47	Some who were standing near the cross misunderstood and said, “He’s calling for Elijah.” 
MAT.27.48	One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink. 
MAT.27.49	But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.”
MAT.27.50	Jesus passionately cried out, 
MAT.27.51	At that moment the veil in the Holy of Holies was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth shook violently, rocks were split apart, 
MAT.27.52	and graves were opened. Then many of the holy ones who had died were brought back to life and came out of their graves. 
MAT.27.53	And after Jesus’ resurrection, they were plainly seen by many people walking in Jerusalem.
MAT.27.54	Now, when the Roman military officer and his soldiers witnessed what was happening and felt the powerful earthquake, they were extremely terrified. They said, “There is no doubt, this man was the Son of God!”
MAT.27.55	Watching from a distance were many of the women who had followed him from Galilee and given him support. 
MAT.27.56	Among them were Mary Magdalene; Mary, the mother of Jacob and Joseph; and the mother of Jacob and John.
MAT.27.57	At the end of the day, a wealthy man named Joseph, a follower of Jesus from the village of Ramah, 
MAT.27.58	approached Pilate and asked to have custody of the body of Jesus. So Pilate consented and ordered that the body be given to him. 
MAT.27.59	Then Joseph wrapped the body in a shroud of fine linen and placed it in his own unused tomb, which had only recently been cut into the rock. 
MAT.27.60	They rolled a large stone to seal the entrance of the tomb and left.
MAT.27.61	Sitting across from the tomb were Mary Magdalene and the other Marys, watching all that took place.
MAT.27.62	The next day, the day after Preparation Day for Passover, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate. 
MAT.27.63	They said to him, “Our master, we remember that this imposter claimed that he would rise from the dead after three days. 
MAT.27.64	So please, order the tomb to be sealed until after the third day. Seal it so that his disciples can’t come and steal the corpse and tell people he rose from the dead. Then the last deception would be worse than the first!”
MAT.27.65	“I will send soldiers to guard the tomb,” Pilate replied. “Go with them and make the tomb as secure as possible.” 
MAT.27.66	So they left and sealed the stone, and Pilate’s soldiers secured the tomb.
MAT.28.1	After the Sabbath ended, at the first light of dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb. 
MAT.28.2+MAT.28.3+MAT.28.4	Suddenly, the earth shook violently beneath their feet as the angel of the Lord Jehovah descended from heaven. Lightning flashed around him and his robe was dazzling white! The guards were stunned and terrified—lying motionless like dead men. Then the angel walked up to the tomb, rolled away the stone, and sat on top of it!
MAT.28.5	The women were breathless and terrified, until the angel said to them, “There’s no reason to be afraid. I know you’re here looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He isn’t here—he has risen victoriously, just as he said! Come inside the tomb and see the place where our Lord was lying. 
MAT.28.7	Then run and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead! I give you his message: “I am going ahead of you in Galilee and you will see me there.”
MAT.28.8	They rushed quickly to tell his disciples, and their hearts were deep in wonder and filled with great joy.
MAT.28.9	Along the way, Jesus suddenly appeared in front of them and said, 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.28.11	After the women left the tomb, a few of the guards went into Jerusalem and told the chief priests everything they had seen and heard. 
MAT.28.12	So the chief priests called a meeting with all the religious leaders and came up with a plan. They bribed the guards with a large sum of money 
MAT.28.13	and told them, “Tell everyone, ‘While we were asleep, his disciples came at night and stole his body!’ 
MAT.28.14	If Pilate finds out about this, don’t worry. We’ll make sure you don’t get blamed.” 
MAT.28.15	So they took the money and did as they were told. (That is why the story of the guards is still circulated among the Jews to this day.)
MAT.28.16	Meanwhile, the eleven disciples heard the wonderful news from the women and left for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them. 
MAT.28.17	The moment they saw him, they worshiped him, but some still had lingering doubts.
MAT.28.18	Then Jesus came close to them and said, 
MRK.1.1	This is the beginning of the wonderful news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
MRK.1.2	It starts with Isaiah the prophet, who wrote:
MRK.1.2	Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you
MRK.1.2	and he will prepare your way!
MRK.1.3	He is a thunderous voice of one
MRK.1.3	who shouts in the wilderness:
MRK.1.3	“Prepare your hearts
MRK.1.3	for the coming of the Lord Yahweh,
MRK.1.3	and clear a straight path
MRK.1.3	inside your hearts for him!”
MRK.1.4	John the Baptizer was the messenger who appeared in an uninhabited region, preaching a baptism of repentance for the complete cancellation of sins. 
MRK.1.5	A steady stream of people came to be dipped in the Jordan River as they publicly confessed their sins. They came from all over southern Israel, including nearly all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
MRK.1.6	John wore a rough garment made from camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and honey of the wilderness. 
MRK.1.7	And this is the message he kept preaching: “There is a man coming after me who is greater and a lot more powerful than I am. I’m not even worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals. 
MRK.1.8	I’ve baptized you into water, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of Holiness!”
MRK.1.9	One day, Jesus came from the Galilean village of Nazareth and had John immerse him in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.10	The moment Jesus rose up out of the water, John saw the heavenly realm split open, and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove and rested upon him. 
MRK.1.11	At the same time, a voice spoke from heaven, saying:
MRK.1.11	“You are my Son, my cherished one,
MRK.1.11	and my greatest delight is in you!”
MRK.1.12	Immediately after this he was compelled by the Holy Spirit to go into an uninhabited desert region. 
MRK.1.13	He remained there in the wilderness for forty days, enduring the ordeals of Satan’s tests. He encountered wild animals, but also angels who appeared and ministered to his needs.
MRK.1.14	Later on, after John the Baptizer was arrested, Jesus went back into the region of Galilee and preached the wonderful gospel of God’s kingdom realm. 
MRK.1.15	His message was this: 
MRK.1.16	As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he noticed two brothers fishing: Simon and Andrew. He watched them as they were casting their nets into the sea 
MRK.1.17	and said to them, 
MRK.1.18	Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus. 
MRK.1.19	Walking a little farther, Jesus found two other brothers sitting in a boat, along with their father, mending their nets. Their names were Jacob and John, and their father Zebedee. 
MRK.1.20	Jesus immediately walked up to them and invited the two brothers to become his followers. At once, Jacob and John dropped their nets, stood up, left their father in the boat with the hired men, and followed Jesus.
MRK.1.21	Then Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum, and he immediately started teaching on the Sabbath day in the synagogue. 
MRK.1.22	The people were awestruck and overwhelmed by his teaching, because he taught in a way that demonstrated 
MRK.1.23	Suddenly, during the meeting, a demon-possessed man screamed out, 
MRK.1.24	“Hey! Leave us alone! Jesus the victorious, I know who you are. You’re God’s Holy One and you have come to destroy us!”
MRK.1.25	Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
MRK.1.26	The man’s body shook violently in spasms, and the demon hurled him to the floor until it finally came out of him with a deafening shriek! 
MRK.1.27	The crowd was awestruck and unable to stop saying among themselves, “What is this new teaching that comes with such authority? With merely a word he commands demons to come out and they obey him!”
MRK.1.28	So the reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in the region of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	Now, as soon as they left the meeting, they went straight to Simon and Andrew’s house, along with Jacob and John. 
MRK.1.30	Simon’s mother-in-law was bedridden, sick with a high fever, so the first thing they did was to tell Jesus about her. 
MRK.1.31	He walked up to her bedside, gently took her hand, and raised her up! Her fever disappeared and she began to serve them.
MRK.1.32	Later in the day, 
MRK.1.33	until the whole village was crowded around the house. 
MRK.1.34	Jesus cured many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who he really was.
MRK.1.35	The next morning, Jesus got up long before daylight, left the house while it was dark, and made his way to a secluded place to give himself to prayer. 
MRK.1.36	Later, Simon and his friends searched for him, 
MRK.1.37	and when they finally tracked him down, they told him, “Everyone is looking for you—they want you!”
MRK.1.38	Jesus replied, 
MRK.1.39	So he went throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the Jewish synagogues and casting out demons.
MRK.1.40	On one occasion, a leper came and threw himself down in front of Jesus, pleading for his healing, saying, “You have the power to heal me right now if only you really want to!” 
MRK.1.41	Being deeply moved with tender compassion, Jesus reached out and touched the skin of the leper and told him, 
MRK.1.42	Instantly his leprous sores completely disappeared and his skin became smooth! 
MRK.1.43	Jesus sent him away with a very stern warning, 
MRK.1.44	saying, 
MRK.1.45	But no sooner did the man leave than he began to proclaim his healing publicly and spread the story everywhere 
MRK.1.45	Jesus’ growing fame prevented him from entering the villages openly, which forced him to remain in isolated places. Even so, a steady stream of people flocked to him from everywhere.
MRK.2.1	Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news quickly spread that he was back in town. 
MRK.2.2	Soon there were so many people crowded inside the house to hear him that there was no more room, even outside the door.
MRK.2.2	While Jesus was preaching the word of God, 
MRK.2.3	four men arrived, carrying a paralyzed man. 
MRK.2.4	But when they realized that they couldn’t even get near him because of the crowd, they went up on top of the house and tore away the roof above Jesus’ head. And when they had broken through, they lowered the paralyzed man on a stretcher 
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw the extent of their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.6	This offended some of the religious scholars who were present, and they reasoned among themselves, 
MRK.2.7	“Who does he think he is to speak this way? This is blasphemy for sure! Only God himself can forgive sins!”
MRK.2.8	Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and said to them, 
MRK.2.12	Immediately the man sprang to his feet in front of everyone and left for home.
MRK.2.12	When the crowds witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God and said, “We’ve never seen anything like this before!”
MRK.2.13	Jesus went out to walk near Lake Galilee, and a massive crowed gathered, so he taught them. 
MRK.2.14	As he walked along, he found Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth, collecting taxes. He approached him and said, 
MRK.2.15	Later, Jesus and his disciples went to have a meal with Levi. Among the guests in Levi’s home were many tax collectors and notable sinners sharing a meal with Jesus, for there were many kinds of people who followed him. 
MRK.2.16	But when the religious scholars and the Pharisees found out that Jesus was keeping company and dining with sinners and tax collectors, they were indignant. So they approached Jesus’ disciples and said to them, “Why is it that someone like Jesus 
MRK.2.17	But when Jesus overheard their complaint, he said to them, 
MRK.2.18	One time, the disciples of John the Baptizer and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that John’s disciples and disciples of the Pharisees are fasting but your disciples are not?”
MRK.2.19	Jesus answered, 
MRK.2.23	One Saturday, on the day of rest, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain to eat. 
MRK.2.24	But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples shouldn’t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!”
MRK.2.25	Jesus responded, 
MRK.2.27	Then he said to them, 
MRK.3.1	Then Jesus left them and went again into the synagogue, where he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand. 
MRK.3.2	Everyone was watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, giving them a reason to accuse him 
MRK.3.3	Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, 
MRK.3.4	Then he turned to all those gathered there and said, 
MRK.3.5	Then looking around at everyone, Jesus was moved with indignation and grieved by the hardness of their hearts and said to the man, 
MRK.3.6	After this happened, the Pharisees left abruptly and began to plot together with the friends and supporters of Herod Antipas on how they would kill Jesus.
MRK.3.7	Once again Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, but a massive crowd of people followed him from all around the provinces of Galilee and southern Israel. 
MRK.3.8	Vast crowds came from Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and from Lebanon. Large numbers of people swarmed in from everywhere when they heard of him and his wonderful works.
MRK.3.9	The crowd pressed so closely to Jesus that he instructed his disciples to bring him a small boat to get into and keep from being crushed by the crowd. 
MRK.3.10	For he had healed so many that the sick kept pushing forward just so they could touch Jesus. 
MRK.3.11	And whenever a demon saw him, it would throw the person down at Jesus’ feet, screaming out, “You are the Son of God!” 
MRK.3.12	But Jesus would silence the demons and sternly order them not to reveal who he was.
MRK.3.13	Afterward, Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to himself the men he wanted to be his close companions, so they went up the mountainside to join him. 
MRK.3.14	He appointed the Twelve, whom he named apostles. He wanted them to be continually at his side as his friends, and so that he could send them out to preach 
MRK.3.15	and have authority to heal the sick and to cast out demons.
MRK.3.16	He appointed his Twelve and gave Simon the nickname Peter the Rock. 
MRK.3.17	And he gave the brothers, Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, the nickname 
MRK.3.18	The others were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Nationalist, 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
MRK.3.20	Then Jesus went home, but once again a large crowd gathered around him, which prevented him from even eating a meal. 
MRK.3.21	When his own family heard that he was there, they went out to seize him, for they said, “He’s insane!”
MRK.3.22	The religious scholars who arrived from Jerusalem were saying, “Satan has possessed him! He casts out demons by the authority of the prince of demons!” 
MRK.3.23	Jesus called them to himself and spoke to them using parables. 
MRK.3.27	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.3.30	(This is because they said he was empowered by a demon spirit.)
MRK.3.31	Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came and stood outside and sent a message to him, asking that he come out and speak with them. 
MRK.3.32	When the crowd sitting around Jesus heard this, they spoke up, and said to him, “Jesus, your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.”
MRK.3.33	He answered them saying, 
MRK.3.34	Then looking in the eyes of those who were sitting in a circle around him, he said, 
MRK.4.1	Once again Jesus went to teach the people on the shore of Lake Galilee and a massive crowd surrounded him. The crowd was so huge that he had to get into a boat and teach the people from there. 
MRK.4.2	He taught them many things by using parables to illustrate spiritual truths, saying:
MRK.4.10	Afterwards, Jesus, his disciples and those close to him remained behind to ask Jesus about his parables. 
MRK.4.11	He said to them, 
MRK.4.13	Then he said to them, 
MRK.4.21	He also gave them this parable: 
MRK.4.24	Then he said to them, 
MRK.4.26	Jesus also told them this parable: 
MRK.4.30	And he told them this parable: 
MRK.4.33	Jesus used many parables such as these as he taught the people, and they learned according to their ability to understand. 
MRK.4.34	He never spoke to them without using parables, but would wait until they were alone before he explained their meanings to his disciples.
MRK.4.35	Later that day, after it grew dark, Jesus said to his disciples, 
MRK.4.36	After they had sent the crowd away, they shoved off from shore with him, as he had been teaching from the boat, and there were other boats that sailed with them. 
MRK.4.37	Suddenly, as they were crossing the lake, a ferocious tempest arose, with violent winds and waves that were crashing into the boat until it was all but swamped. 
MRK.4.38	But Jesus was calmly sleeping in the stern, resting on a cushion. 
MRK.4.39	So they shook him awake, saying, “Teacher, don’t you even care that we are all about to die!” Fully awake, he rebuked the storm and shouted to the sea, 
MRK.4.40	Then he turned to his disciples and said to them, 
MRK.4.41	But they were overwhelmed with fear and awe and said to one another, “Who is this man who has such authority that even the wind and waves obey him?”
MRK.5.1	They arrived at the other side of the lake, at the region of the Gerasenes. 
MRK.5.2	As Jesus stepped ashore, a demon-possessed madman came out of the graveyard and confronted him. 
MRK.5.3	The man had been living there among the tombs of the dead, and no one was able to restrain him, not even with chains. 
MRK.5.4	For every time they attempted to chain his hands and feet with shackles, he would snap the chains and break the shackles in pieces. He was so strong that no one had the power to subdue him. 
MRK.5.5	Day and night he could be found lurking in the cemetery or in the vicinity, shrieking and mangling himself with stones!
MRK.5.6	When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran to him and threw himself down before him, 
MRK.5.7	screaming out at the top of his lungs, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! Swear in God’s name that you won’t torture me!” 
MRK.5.8	(For Jesus had already said to him, 
MRK.5.9	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.5.9	“Mob,” he answered. “They call me Mob because there are thousands of us in his body!” 
MRK.5.10	He begged Jesus repeatedly not to expel them out of the region.
MRK.5.11	Nearby there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside. 
MRK.5.12	The demons begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them!”
MRK.5.13	So Jesus gave them permission, and the demon horde immediately came out of the man and went into the pigs! This caused the herd to rush madly down the steep slope and fall into the lake, drowning about two thousand pigs!
MRK.5.14	Now, the herdsmen fled to the nearby villages, telling everyone what they saw as they ran through the countryside, and everyone came out to see what had happened. 
MRK.5.15	When they found Jesus, they saw the demonized man sitting there, properly clothed and in his right mind. Seeing what had happened to the man who had thousands of demons, the people were terrified. 
MRK.5.16	Those who had witnessed 
MRK.5.17	Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.
MRK.5.18	And as Jesus began to get into the boat to depart, the man who had been set free from demons asked him, “Could I go with you?” 
MRK.5.19	Jesus answered, 
MRK.5.20	So the man left and went into the region of Jordan and parts of Syria to tell everyone he met about what Jesus had done for him, and all the people marveled!
MRK.5.21	After Jesus returned from across the lake, a huge crowd of people quickly gathered around him on the shoreline. 
MRK.5.22	Just then, a man saw that it was Jesus, so he pushed through the crowd and threw himself down at his feet. His name was Jairus, a Jewish official who was in charge of the synagogue. 
MRK.5.23	He pleaded with Jesus, saying over and over, “Please come with me! My little daughter is at the point of death, 
MRK.5.24	Immediately Jesus went with him, and the huge crowd followed, pressing in on him from all sides.
MRK.5.25	Now, in the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered horribly from continual bleeding for twelve years. 
MRK.5.26	She had endured a great deal under the care of various doctors, yet in spite of spending all she had on their treatments, she was not getting better, but worse. 
MRK.5.27	When she heard about Jesus’ 
MRK.5.28	For she kept saying to herself, “If only I could touch his clothes, I know I will be healed.” 
MRK.5.29	As soon as her hand touched him, her bleeding immediately stopped! She knew it, for she could feel her body instantly being healed of her disease!
MRK.5.30	Jesus knew at once that someone had touched him, for he felt the power that always surged around him had passed through him for someone to be healed. He turned and spoke to the crowd, saying, 
MRK.5.31	His disciples answered, “What do you mean, who touched you? Look at this huge crowd—they’re all pressing up against you.” 
MRK.5.32	But Jesus’ eyes swept across the crowd, looking for the one who had touched him for healing.
MRK.5.33	When the woman who experienced this miracle realized what had happened to her, she came before him, trembling with fear, and threw herself down at his feet, 
MRK.5.34	Then Jesus said to her, 
MRK.5.35	And before he had finished speaking, people arrived from Jairus’ house 
MRK.5.36	But Jesus refused to listen to what they were told and said to the Jewish official, 
MRK.5.37	, but Jesus didn’t allow anyone to go with them except Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John.
MRK.5.38	When they arrived at the home of the synagogue ruler, they encountered a noisy uproar among the people, for they were all weeping and wailing. 
MRK.5.39	Upon entering the home, Jesus said to them, 
MRK.5.40	Then everyone began to ridicule and make fun of him. But he threw them all outside.
MRK.5.40	Then he took the child’s father and mother and his three disciples and went into the room where the girl was lying. 
MRK.5.41	He tenderly clasped the child’s hand in his and said to her in Aramaic, 
MRK.5.42	Instantly the twelve-year-old girl sat up, stood to her feet, and started walking around the room! Everyone was overcome with astonishment in seeing this miracle! 
MRK.5.43	Jesus had them bring her something to eat. And he repeatedly cautioned them that they were to tell no one about what had happened.
MRK.6.1	Afterward, Jesus left Capernaum and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown. 
MRK.6.2	On the Sabbath, he went to teach in the synagogue. Everyone who heard his teaching was overwhelmed with astonishment. They said among themselves, “What incredible wisdom has been given to him! Where did he receive such profound insights? And what mighty miracles flow through his hands! 
MRK.6.3	Isn’t this Mary’s son, the carpenter, the brother of Jacob, Joseph, Judah, and Simon? And don’t his sisters all live here in Nazareth?” And they took offense at him.
MRK.6.4	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	He was unable to do any great miracle in Nazareth, except to heal a few sick people by laying his hands upon them. 
MRK.6.6	He was amazed at the depth of their unbelief!
MRK.6.6	Then Jesus went out into the different villages and taught the people.
MRK.6.7	Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them his authority to cast out demons. Then he sent them out in pairs with these instructions: 
MRK.6.12	So they went out and preached publicly that everyone should repent. 
MRK.6.13	They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
MRK.6.14	King Herod soon heard about Jesus, for the name of Jesus was on everyone’s lips. Some were even saying about him, “John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and that’s why miraculous powers flow from him!” 
MRK.6.15	Others said, “No, he’s Elijah!” While others said, “He’s a prophet, like one of the prophets of old!”
MRK.6.16	When Herod heard what the people were saying, he concluded, “I beheaded John, and now he’s raised from the dead!” 
MRK.6.17+MRK.6.18	For Herod had John arrested and thrown into prison for repeatedly rebuking him in public, saying, “You have no right to marry Herodias, the wife of your brother Philip! You are violating the law of God!”
MRK.6.19	This infuriated Herodias, and she held a bitter grudge against him and wanted John executed. 
MRK.6.20	But Herod both feared and stood in awe of John and kept him safely in custody, because he was convinced that he was a righteous and holy man. Every time Herod heard John speak, it disturbed his soul, but he was drawn to him and enjoyed listening to his words.
MRK.6.21	But Herodias found her opportunity to have John killed—it was on the king’s birthday! Herod prepared a great banquet and invited all his officials, military commanders, and the leaders of the province of Galilee to celebrate with him on his birthday. 
MRK.6.22	On the day of the feast, his stepdaughter, the daughter of Herodias, came to honor the king with a beautiful dance, and she flattered him. Her dancing greatly pleased the king and his guests, so he said to the girl, “You can ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you!” 
MRK.6.23	And he repeated it in front of everyone, with a vow to complete his promise to her: “Anything you desire and it will be yours! I’ll even share my kingdom with you!”
MRK.6.24	She immediately left the room and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptizer on a platter!” 
MRK.6.25	So she hurried back to the king and made her request: “I want you to bring me the head of John the Baptizer on a platter—and I want it right now!”
MRK.6.26	Deeply grieved, the king regretted his promise to her, but since he had made his vow in front of all his honored guests, he couldn’t deny her request. 
MRK.6.27	So without delay the king ordered an executioner to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison. 
MRK.6.28	He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl brought it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When John’s followers heard what had happened, they came and removed his body and laid it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	The apostles 
MRK.6.31	There was such a swirl of activity around Jesus, with so many people coming and going, that they were unable to even eat a meal. So Jesus said to his disciples, 
MRK.6.32	They slipped away and left by sailboat for a deserted spot. 
MRK.6.33	But many of the people saw them leaving and realized where they were headed, so they took off running along the shore. Then people from the surrounding towns joined them in the chase, and a large crowd got there ahead of them.
MRK.6.34	By the time Jesus came ashore, a massive crowd was waiting. At the sight of them, his heart was filled with compassion, because they seemed like wandering sheep who had no shepherd. So he taught them many things.
MRK.6.35	Late that afternoon, his disciples said, “It’s getting really late and we’re here in this remote place with nothing to eat. 
MRK.6.36	You should send the crowds away so they can go into the surrounding villages and buy food for themselves.”
MRK.6.37	But he answered them, 
MRK.6.37	“Are you sure?” they replied. “You really want us to go buy them supper? It would cost a small fortune to feed all these thousands of hungry people.”
MRK.6.38	 he asked. 
MRK.6.39	Then he instructed them to organize the crowd and have them sit down in groups on the grass. 
MRK.6.40	So they had them sit down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 
MRK.6.41	Then Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, gazed into heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and the two fish and distributed them to his disciples to serve the people—
MRK.6.42	Everyone had plenty to eat and was fully satisfied. 
MRK.6.43	Then the twelve disciples picked up what remained, and each of them ended up with a basket full of leftovers! 
MRK.6.44	Altogether, five thousand families were fed that day!
MRK.6.45	After everyone had their meal, Jesus instructed his disciples to get back into the boat and go on ahead of him and sail to the other side to Bethsaida. 
MRK.6.46	So he dispersed the crowd, said good-bye to his disciples, then slipped away to pray on the mountain.
MRK.6.47	As night fell, the boat was in the middle of the lake and Jesus was alone on land. 
MRK.6.48	The wind was against the disciples and he could see that they were straining at the oars, trying to make headway.
MRK.6.48	When it was almost morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the surface of the water, and he started to pass by them. 
MRK.6.49+MRK.6.50	When they all saw him walking on the waves, they thought he was a ghost and screamed out in terror. But he said to them at once, 
MRK.6.51	Then he came closer and climbed into the boat with them, and immediately the stormy wind became still. They were completely and utterly overwhelmed with astonishment 
MRK.6.52	because they failed to learn the lesson of the 
MRK.6.53	They made landfall at Gennesaret and anchored there. 
MRK.6.54	The moment they got out of the boat, everyone recognized that it was Jesus, 
MRK.6.55	So they ran throughout the region, telling the people, “Bring all the sick—even those too sick to walk and bring them on mats!” 
MRK.6.56	Wherever he went, in the countryside, villages, or towns, they placed the sick on mats in the streets or in public places and begged him, saying, “Just let us touch the tassel of your prayer shawl!” And all who touched him were instantly healed!
MRK.7.1	One day, those known as the Pharisees and certain religious scholars came from Jerusalem and gathered around Jesus. 
MRK.7.2	They were shocked to find that some of Jesus’ disciples ate bread without first observing the prescribed Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating their meal. 
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees, like all other Jews, will not eat without first performing a ritual of pouring water over their cupped hands to keep the tradition of the elders. 
MRK.7.4	Similarly, when returning from the marketplace, they ceremonially wash themselves before eating. They also observed many other traditions, such as ceremonially washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.)
MRK.7.5	So the Pharisees and religious scholars asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the age-old traditions passed down by our elders? They should first ceremonially wash their hands before eating.”
MRK.7.6	Jesus replied, 
MRK.7.9	Then he added, 
MRK.7.14	Then Jesus called the crowd together again, saying, 
MRK.7.17	When Jesus went back home and away from the crowd, his disciples 
MRK.7.18	He answered them, 
MRK.7.19	 (This means all foods are clean.) 
MRK.7.20	He added, 
MRK.7.24	Jesus set out from there to go into the non-Jewish region of Tyre. He intended to slip into a house unnoticed, but people found out that he was there. 
MRK.7.25	But when a woman whose daughter had a demon spirit heard he was there, she came and threw herself down at his feet. 
MRK.7.26	She was not Jewish, but a foreigner, born in the part of Syria known as Phoenicia. She begged him repeatedly to cast the demon out of her daughter. 
MRK.7.27	Finally he said to her, 
MRK.7.28	She answered, “How true that is, Lord. But even puppies under the family table are allowed to eat the little children’s crumbs.”
MRK.7.29	Then Jesus said to her, 
MRK.7.30	And when she returned home, she found her daughter resting quietly on the couch, completely set free from the demon!
MRK.7.31	After this, Jesus left the coastland of Tyre and came through Sidon on his way to Lake Galilee and over into regions of Syria. 
MRK.7.32	Some people brought to him a deaf man with a severe speech impediment. They pleaded with Jesus to place his hands on him and heal him.
MRK.7.33	So Jesus led him away from the crowd to a private spot. Then he stuck his fingers into the man’s ears and placed some of his saliva on the man’s tongue. 
MRK.7.34	Then he gazed into heaven, sighed deeply, and spoke to the man’s ears and tongue, 
MRK.7.35	At once the man’s ears opened and he could hear perfectly, and his tongue was untied and he began to speak normally. 
MRK.7.36	Jesus ordered everyone to keep this miracle a secret, but the more he told them not to, the more the news spread! 
MRK.7.37	The people were absolutely beside themselves and astonished beyond measure. And they began to declare, “Everything he does is wonderful! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!”
MRK.8.1	During those days, another massive crowd gathered to hear Jesus, and again, there was no food and the people were hungry. So Jesus called his disciples to come near him and said to them, 
MRK.8.4	His disciples replied, “But could anyone possibly get enough food to satisfy a crowd this size out here in this isolated place?”
MRK.8.5	He asked them, 
MRK.8.5	“Seven,” they replied.
MRK.8.6	Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the grass. After he took the seven loaves, he gave thanks to God, broke them, and started handing them to his disciples. They kept distributing the bread until they had served the entire crowd.
MRK.8.7	They also had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for these, Jesus had his disciples serve them to the crowd. 
MRK.8.8	Everyone ate until they were satisfied. Then the disciples gathered up the broken pieces and filled seven large baskets with the leftovers. 
MRK.8.9	About four thousand people ate the food that had been multiplied! Then he dismissed the crowd.
MRK.8.10	Afterward, Jesus got into a boat and sailed to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	As soon as Jesus landed, he was confronted by the Pharisees, who argued with Jesus and tested him. They demanded that he give them a miraculous sign from heaven.
MRK.8.12	And with a deep sigh from his spirit, he said, 
MRK.8.13	Then he turned and left them, got back into the boat, and crossed over to the opposite shore.
MRK.8.14	Now, the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them, except for one loaf of flatbread. 
MRK.8.15	, Jesus repeatedly warned them, 
MRK.8.16	But the disciples had no clue what Jesus was talking about, so they began to discuss it among themselves, saying, “Is he saying this because we forgot to bring bread?”
MRK.8.17	Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus said to them, 
MRK.8.19	“Twelve,” they replied.
MRK.8.20	“Seven,” they replied.
MRK.8.22	When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, begging him to touch him and heal him. 
MRK.8.23	So Jesus led him, as his sighted guide, outside the village. He placed his saliva on the man’s eyes and covered them with his hands. Then he asked him, 
MRK.8.24	“Yes,” he said. “My sight is coming back! I’m beginning to see people, but they look like trees—walking trees.”
MRK.8.25	Jesus put his hands over the man’s eyes a second time and made him look up. The man opened his eyes wide and he could see everything perfectly. His eyesight was completely restored! 
MRK.8.26	Then Jesus sent him home with these instructions: 
MRK.8.27	Then Jesus and his disciples walked to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he posed this question to his disciples: 
MRK.8.28	They replied, “Some say John the Baptizer, others say Elijah the prophet, and still others say you must be one of the prophets.”
MRK.8.29	He asked them, 
MRK.8.29	Peter spoke up, saying, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God!”
MRK.8.30	Then he warned them not to breathe a word of this to anyone.
MRK.8.31	From then on, Jesus began to tell his disciples that he, the Son of Man, was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer great injustice from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again. 
MRK.8.32	Jesus opened his heart and spoke freely with his disciples, explaining all these things to them.
MRK.8.32	Then Peter took him aside and rebuked him. 
MRK.8.33	But Jesus turned around, and glancing at all of the other disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, 
MRK.8.34	Jesus summoned the crowd, along with his disciples, and had them gather around. And he said to them: 
MRK.9.1	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.9.2	After six days, Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone. And Jesus’ appearance was dramatically altered, for he was transfigured before their very eyes! 
MRK.9.3	His clothing sparkled and became glistening white—whiter than any bleach in the world could make them. 
MRK.9.4	Then suddenly, right in front of them, Moses and Elijah appeared, and they spoke with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	Peter blurted out, “Beautiful Teacher, 
MRK.9.6	(For all of the disciples were in total fear, and Peter didn’t have a clue what to say.) 
MRK.9.7	Just then, a radiant cloud began to spread over them, enveloping them all. And God’s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, “This is my most dearly loved Son—always listen to him!”
MRK.9.8	Suddenly, when they looked around, the disciples saw only Jesus, for Moses and Elijah had faded away.
MRK.9.9	As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them, 
MRK.9.10	So they kept it to themselves, puzzled over what Jesus meant about rising from the dead.
MRK.9.11	Then they asked him, “Why do the religious scholars insist that Elijah must come before the Messiah?”
MRK.9.12	He answered them, 
MRK.9.14	Now when they came down the mountain to the other nine disciples, they noticed a large crowd of people gathered around them, with the religious scholars arguing with them. 
MRK.9.15	The crowd was astonished to see Jesus himself walking toward them, so they immediately ran to welcome him.
MRK.9.16	 he asked them.
MRK.9.17	A man spoke up out of the crowd. “Teacher,” he said, “I have a son possessed by a demon that makes him mute. I brought him here to you, Jesus. 
MRK.9.18	Whenever the demon takes control of him, it knocks him down, and he foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth, and his body becomes stiff as a board. I brought him to your disciples, hoping they could deliver him, but they were not strong enough.”
MRK.9.19	Jesus said to the crowd, 
MRK.9.20	So they brought him to Jesus. As soon as the demon saw him, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground, rolling around and foaming at the mouth. 
MRK.9.21	Jesus turned to the father and asked, 
MRK.9.21	“Since childhood,” he replied. 
MRK.9.22	“It tries over and over to kill him by throwing him into fire or water. But please, if you’re able to do something, anything—have compassion on us and help us!”
MRK.9.23	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.9.24	When he heard this, the boy’s father cried out with tears, saying, “I do believe, Lord; help my little faith!”
MRK.9.25	Now when Jesus saw that the crowd was quickly growing larger, he commanded the demon, saying, 
MRK.9.26	The demon shrieked and threw the boy into terrible seizures and finally came out of him! As the boy lay there, looking like a corpse, everyone thought he was dead. 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus stooped down, gently took his hand, and raised him up to his feet, and he stood there completely set free!
MRK.9.28	Afterwards, when Jesus arrived at the house, his disciples asked him in private, “Why couldn’t we cast out the demon?”
MRK.9.29	He answered them, 
MRK.9.30	They went on from there and walked through the region of Galilee. Jesus didn’t want the people to know he was there, because he wanted to teach his disciples in private. 
MRK.9.31	He said to them, 
MRK.9.32	But the disciples didn’t have a clue what he meant and were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.
MRK.9.33	Then they came to Capernaum. And as soon as Jesus was inside the house, he asked his disciples, 
MRK.9.34	No one said a word, because they had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest. 
MRK.9.35	Jesus sat down, called the twelve disciples to come around him, and said to them, 
MRK.9.36	Then he had a child come and stand among them. He wrapped the child in his arms and said to them, 
MRK.9.38	John spoke up and said, “Teacher, we noticed someone was using your name to cast out demons, so we tried to stop him because he wasn’t one of our group.”
MRK.9.39	 Jesus replied. 
MRK.10.1	Then Jesus left the region and went into the district of Judea, across from the Jordan River, and again, massive crowds flocked to him, and Jesus, as was his custom, began to teach the people. 
MRK.10.2	At one point, some of the Pharisees came, seeking to entrap him with a question. “Tell us,” they asked, “is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
MRK.10.3	He answered them, 
MRK.10.4	They replied, “Moses permitted us to write a certificate of separation that would be valid to complete a divorce.”
MRK.10.5	Jesus said, 
MRK.10.10	Once indoors, his disciples asked him to explain it to them again. 
MRK.10.11	So he said to them, 
MRK.10.13	The parents kept bringing their little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them 
MRK.10.14	When Jesus saw what was happening, he became indignant with his disciples and said to them, 
MRK.10.16	Then he embraced each child, and laying his hands on them, he lovingly blessed each one.
MRK.10.17	As Jesus started on his way, a man came running up to him. Kneeling down in front of him, he cried out, “Good Teacher, what one thing am I required to do to gain eternal life?”
MRK.10.18	Jesus responded, 
MRK.10.20	The man said to Jesus, “Teacher, I have carefully obeyed these laws since my youth.”
MRK.10.21	Jesus fixed his gaze upon the man, with tender love, and said to him, 
MRK.10.22	Completely shocked by Jesus’ answer, he turned and walked away very sad, for he was extremely rich.
MRK.10.23	Jesus looked at the faces of his disciples and said, 
MRK.10.24	The disciples were startled when they heard this. But Jesus again said to them, 
MRK.10.26	But this left them all the more astonished, and they whispered to one another, “Then who could ever be saved?”
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them and replied, 
MRK.10.28	Then Peter spoke up and said, “Can’t you see that we’ve left everything we had to cling to you?”
MRK.10.29	 Jesus said. 
MRK.10.32	Jesus and his disciples were on the road that went up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them forward. The disciples were filled with wonder and amazement at his bravery, but those following along with them were very afraid. As they approached the city, he took the Twelve aside privately and told them what was going to happen. 
MRK.10.35	Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus and said, “Teacher, will you do a favor for us?”
MRK.10.36	 he asked.
MRK.10.37	“We want to sit next to you when you come into your glory,” they said, “one at your right hand and the other at your left.”
MRK.10.38	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.39	They replied, “Yes, we are able.”
MRK.10.39	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.41	Now the other ten disciples overheard this, and they became angry and began to criticize Jacob and John. 
MRK.10.42	Jesus gathered them all together and said to them, 
MRK.10.46	When Jesus and his disciples had passed through Jericho, a large crowd joined them. Upon leaving the village, they met a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road named Timai, the son of Timai. 
MRK.10.47	When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout “Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me now in my affliction. 
MRK.10.48	Those in the crowd were indignant and scolded him for making so much of a disturbance, but he kept shouting with all his might, “Son of David, have mercy on me now 
MRK.10.49	Jesus stopped and said, 
MRK.10.50	So he threw off his beggars’ cloak, jumped up, and made his way to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.10.51	The man replied, “My Master, please, let me see again!”
MRK.10.52	Jesus responded, 
MRK.11.1	Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem, they arrived at the place of the stables near Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead 
MRK.11.2	and said to them, 
MRK.11.4	So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied to a gate. When they started to untie it, 
MRK.11.5	some people standing there said to them, “Why are untying that colt?”
MRK.11.6	They answered just as Jesus had told them: 
MRK.11.7	The disciples brought the colt to Jesus and piled their cloaks 
MRK.11.8	Many people carpeted the road in front of him with their cloaks 
MRK.11.9	Jesus rode 
MRK.11.10	Blessings rest on this kingdom he ushers in right now—the kingdom of our father David! Bring us the victory in the highest realms 
MRK.11.11	Jesus rode through the gates of Jerusalem and up to the temple. After looking around at everything, he left for Bethany with the Twelve to spend the night, for it was already late in the day.
MRK.11.12	The next day, as he left Bethany, Jesus was feeling hungry. 
MRK.11.13	He noticed a leafy fig tree in the distance, so he walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none—only leaves (for it wasn’t yet the season for bearing figs). 
MRK.11.14	Jesus spoke to the fig tree, saying, 
MRK.11.15	When they came into Jerusalem, Jesus went directly into the temple area and overturned all the tables and benches of the merchants who were doing business there. One by one he drove them all out of the temple courts, and they scattered away, including the money changers and those selling doves. 
MRK.11.16	And he would not allow them to use the temple courts as a thoroughfare for carrying their merchandise and their furniture.
MRK.11.17	Then he began to teach the people, saying, 
MRK.11.18	When the chief priests and religious scholars heard this, they began to hatch a plot as to how they could eliminate Jesus. But they feared him and his influence, because the entire crowd was carried away with astonishment by his teaching. 
MRK.11.19	So he and his disciples spent the nights outside the city.
MRK.11.20	In the morning, they passed by the fig tree that Jesus spoke to and it was completely withered from the roots up. 
MRK.11.21	Peter remembered and said to him, “Teacher, look! That’s the fig tree you cursed. It’s now all shriveled up and dead.”
MRK.11.22	Jesus replied, 
MRK.11.27	They came again into Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the Jewish rulers—the chief priest, certain religious scholars, and the elders—approached him. They came up to him 
MRK.11.28	and asked, “What right do you have to say and do these things? Who gave you the authority to do all this?”
MRK.11.29	Jesus replied, 
MRK.11.31	They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, “How should we answer this? If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Then why didn’t you respond to John and believe what he said?’ 
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘from the people,’ we fear the crowds, for they’re convinced that John was God’s prophet.”
MRK.11.33	So they finally answered, “We don’t know.”
MRK.11.33	 Jesus replied.
MRK.12.1	Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables: 
MRK.12.12	Now, the chief priests, religious scholars, and leaders realized that Jesus’ parable was aimed at them. They had hoped to arrest him then and there, but they feared the reaction of the crowd, so they left him alone and went away.
MRK.12.13	Then they sent a delegation of Pharisees, together with some staunch supporters of Herod, to entrap Jesus with his own words. 
MRK.12.14	So they approached him and said, “Teacher, we know that you’re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God’s ways. We can clearly see that you’re not one who speaks only to win the people’s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences. So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
MRK.12.15	Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said to them, 
MRK.12.16	They brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax.
MRK.12.16	 Jesus said, 
MRK.12.16	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MRK.12.17	Jesus said, 
MRK.12.18	Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question: 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother’s family line. 
MRK.12.20	Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, and he had no children. 
MRK.12.21	The second brother married his oldest brother’s widow, and he also died without any children, and the third also. 
MRK.12.22	This repeated down to the seventh brother, none of whom had children. Finally, the woman died. 
MRK.12.23	So here’s our dilemma: Which of the seven brothers will be the woman’s husband when she’s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?”
MRK.12.24	Jesus answered them, 
MRK.12.28	Now a certain religious scholar overheard them debating. When he saw how beautifully Jesus answered all their questions, he posed one of his own, and asked him, “Teacher, which commandment is the greatest of all?”
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered him, 
MRK.12.32	The religious scholar replied, “Yes, that’s true, Teacher. You spoke beautifully when you said that God is one, and there is no one else besides him. 
MRK.12.33	And there is something more important to God than all the sacrifices and burnt offerings: it’s the commandment to constantly love God with every passion of your heart, with your every thought, and with all your strength—and to love your neighbor in the same way as you love yourself.”
MRK.12.34	When Jesus noticed how thoughtfully and sincerely the man answered, he said to him, 
MRK.12.35	While Jesus was teaching in the courts of the temple, he posed a question to those listening: 
MRK.12.37	The large crowd that had gathered around Jesus took delight in hearing his words.
MRK.12.38	Jesus also taught the people, 
MRK.12.41	Then he sat down near the offering box, watching all the people dropping in their coins. Many of the rich would put in very large sums, 
MRK.12.42	but a destitute widow walked up and dropped in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny. 
MRK.12.43	Jesus called his disciples to gather around and then said to them, 
MRK.13.1	As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, one of his disciples came to him and said, “Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! And what tremendous stones were used to build all this!”
MRK.13.2	Jesus turned to them and said, 
MRK.13.3	Later, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the temple, his disciples, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew, came to him privately where he was sitting and said, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what supernatural sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?”
MRK.13.5	Jesus answered, 
MRK.13.14	 [Let the reader learn what it means], 
MRK.14.1	Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the leading priests and religious scholars were committed to finding a way to secretly arrest Jesus and have him executed. 
MRK.14.2	But they all agreed that their plot could not succeed if they carried it out during the days of the feast, for they said, “There could be a riot among the people.”
MRK.14.3	Now Jesus was in Bethany, in the home of Simon, a man Jesus had healed of leprosy. And as he was reclining at the table, a woman came into the house, holding an alabaster flask. It was filled with the highest quality of fragrant and expensive oil. 
MRK.14.4	But some were highly indignant when they saw this, and they complained to one another, saying, “What a total waste! 
MRK.14.5	It could have been sold for a great sum, and the money could have benefited the poor.” So they scolded her harshly.
MRK.14.6	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.10	One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to the leading priests to inform them of his willingness to betray Jesus into their hands. 
MRK.14.11	They were delighted to hear this and agreed to pay him for it. So immediately Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray him.
MRK.14.12	On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover Lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where would you like us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
MRK.14.13	So he sent two of his disciples ahead into Jerusalem with these instructions: 
MRK.14.16	So they went into the city and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared for him the Passover meal. 
MRK.14.17	And when evening came, he entered the house and went upstairs with his twelve disciples. 
MRK.14.18	Over dinner, while they were reclining around the table, Jesus said, 
MRK.14.19	Feeling deeply troubled by these words, one after another asked him, “You don’t mean me, do you?”
MRK.14.20	He answered, 
MRK.14.22	As they ate, Jesus took the bread and blessed it, tore it, and gave it to his disciples. He said to them, 
MRK.14.23	Then taking the cup of wine and giving praises to the Father, he declared the new covenant with them. And as each one drank from the cup, 
MRK.14.24	he said to them, 
MRK.14.26	Then they sang a psalm and afterwards left for the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.29	Then Peter spoke up and said, “Even if all the rest lose their faith and fall away, I will still be beside you, Jesus!”
MRK.14.30	Jesus said, 
MRK.14.31	But Peter was insistent and replied emphatically, “I will absolutely not! Under no circumstances will I ever deny you—even if I have to die with you!” And all the others repeated the same thing.
MRK.14.32	Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called “The Oil Press.” He told them, 
MRK.14.33	He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him. An intense feeling of great horror plunged his soul into deep sorrow and agony. 
MRK.14.34	And he said to them, 
MRK.14.35	He walked a short distance away, and being overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground. He prayed that if it were possible, he would not have to experience this hour 
MRK.14.36	He prayed, 
MRK.14.37	Then he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him, 
MRK.14.39	Then he left them a second time and went to pray the same thing. 
MRK.14.40	Afterward, he came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open and they didn’t know what to say to him.
MRK.14.41	After praying for the third time, he returned to his disciples and awoke them again, saying, 
MRK.14.43	At that moment Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests, the religious scholars, and the Jewish leaders. 
MRK.14.44	Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, “Jesus is the man I will kiss. So grab him and take him safely away.” 
MRK.14.45	Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi, my Teacher!” and he kissed him affectionately on both cheeks.
MRK.14.46	Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him. 
MRK.14.47	One of the disciples pulled out a sword and swung it at the servant of 
MRK.14.48	Jesus said to the mob, 
MRK.14.50	At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.
MRK.14.51	There was a young man there following Jesus, wearing only a linen sheet wrapped around him. 
MRK.14.52	They tried to arrest him also, but he slipped from their grasp and ran off naked, leaving his linen cloth in their hands.
MRK.14.53	Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, to a meeting where the religious scholars and Jewish leaders were assembled. 
MRK.14.54	Now, Peter had followed him from a distance all the way to the chief priest’s courtyard. He sat with the guards and was warming himself by the fire.
MRK.14.55	The chief priests and the entire supreme Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to find false charges that they could bring against Jesus and condemn him to death, but they could not find any. 
MRK.14.56	Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated. 
MRK.14.57	Some came forward and testified against him, saying, 
MRK.14.58	“We heard him say, ‘I can destroy this temple made with hands and then build another one again in three days not made with hands!’ ” 
MRK.14.59	Yet even on this point the witnesses did not agree.
MRK.14.60	Finally, the chief priest stood up in the middle of them and said to Jesus, “Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they’re saying about you true?”
MRK.14.61	But Jesus remained silent before them and did not answer. So the chief priest said to him, “Are you the anointed Messiah, the Son of the Blessed God?”
MRK.14.62	Jesus answered him, 
MRK.14.63	Then, 
MRK.14.64	for you’ve heard this grievous blasphemy.” 
MRK.14.64	“He’s guilty and deserves the death penalty!” they all answered.
MRK.14.65	Then they spat on his face and blindfolded him. Others struck him over and over with their fists and taunted him by saying, “Prophesy to us! 
MRK.14.66	Meanwhile, Peter was sitting below in the courtyard when a girl, a servant of the high priest, came near the fire. 
MRK.14.67	When she saw Peter there warming himself, she said to him, “I recognize you. You were with that Nazarene, Jesus.”
MRK.14.68	But Peter denied it, saying, “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.” Then he went out to the gateway of the courtyard and the rooster crowed.
MRK.14.69	When the servant girl noticed him, she said to all the bystanders, “I know this man is one of his followers!”
MRK.14.70	Once again, Peter denied it. A short time later, the bystanders said to him, “You must be one of them. You’re a Galilean, like he is, for your accent proves it!”
MRK.14.71	Peter cursed and said, “I tell you, I don’t know this man you’re talking about!”
MRK.14.72	At the same moment Peter spoke those words, the sound of a rooster crowing pierced the night for the second time. And Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him earlier: 
MRK.15.1	Before dawn that morning, all the ruling priests, elders, religious scholars, and the entire Jewish council set in motion their plan against Jesus. They bound him in chains, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate.
MRK.15.2	, Pilate asked him, “So, are you really the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.2	Jesus answered, 
MRK.15.3	Then the ruling priests, over and over, made bitter accusations against him, but he remained silent.
MRK.15.4	So Pilate questioned him again. “Have you nothing to say? Don’t you hear these many allegations they’re making against you?” 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the great astonishment of Pilate.
MRK.15.6	Every year at Passover, it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people—anyone they wanted. 
MRK.15.7	Now, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Barabbas, one of the assassins who had committed murder in an uprising. 
MRK.15.8	The crowds gathered in front of Pilate’s judgment bench and asked him to release a prisoner to them, as was his custom.
MRK.15.9	So he asked them, “Do you want me to release to you today the king of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	(Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of sheer spite and envy.)
MRK.15.11	But the ruling priests stirred up the crowd to incite them to ask for Barabbas instead.
MRK.15.12	So Pilate asked them, “Then what do you want me to do with this one you call the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.13	They all shouted back, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.14	“Why?” Pilate asked. “What evil thing has he done wrong?” But they kept shouting out with an deafening roar, “Crucify him at once!”
MRK.15.15	Because he wanted to please the people, Pilate released Barabbas to them. After he had Jesus severely beaten with a whip made of leather straps 
MRK.15.16	The soldiers took Jesus into the headquarters of the governor’s compound and summoned a military unit of nearly six hundred men. 
MRK.15.17	They placed a purple robe on him 
MRK.15.18	And with a mock salute they repeatedly cried out, “Hail, your majesty, king of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	They kept on spitting in his face and hit him repeatedly on his head with a reed staff, driving the crown of thorns deep into his brow. They knelt down before him in mockery, pretending to pay him homage. 
MRK.15.20	When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to be crucified.
MRK.15.21	As they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, a native of Libya. He was passing by, just coming in from the countryside with his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him to carry the heavy crossbeam for Jesus. 
MRK.15.22	They brought Jesus to the execution site called Golgotha, which means “Skull Hill.” 
MRK.15.23	There they offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall, but he refused to drink it.
MRK.15.24	They nailed his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them. 
MRK.15.25	It was nine o’clock in the morning when they finally crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	Above his head they placed a sign with the inscription of the charge against him, which read, “This is the King of the Jews.”
MRK.15.27	Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him. 
MRK.15.28	This fulfilled the Scripture that says:
MRK.15.28	He was considered to be a criminal.
MRK.15.29	Those who passed by shook their heads and spitefully ridiculed him, saying, “Aha! You boasted that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days. 
MRK.15.30	Why don’t you save yourself now? Just come down from the cross!”
MRK.15.31	Even the ruling priests and the religious scholars joined in the mockery and kept laughing among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but he can’t even save himself! Israel’s king, is he? 
MRK.15.32	Let the ‘Messiah,’ the ‘king of Israel,’ 
MRK.15.33	For three hours, beginning at noon, darkness came over the earth. 
MRK.15.34	About three o’clock, Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic, 
MRK.15.35	Some who were standing near the cross 
MRK.15.36	One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink. But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.” 
MRK.15.37	Just then Jesus passionately cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last. 
MRK.15.38	At that moment the veil 
MRK.15.39	When the Roman military officer who was standing right in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, “There is no doubt this man was the Son of God!
MRK.15.40+MRK.15.41	Watching from a distance, 
MRK.15.42	Evening was fast approaching, and it was a preparation day before a Sabbath. 
MRK.15.43	So a prominent Jewish leader named Joseph, from the village of Ramah, courageously went to see Pilate and asked to have custody of the body of Jesus. Joseph was a highly regarded member of the Jewish council and a follower of Jesus who had focused his hope on God’s kingdom realm. 
MRK.15.44	Pilate was amazed to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the Roman officer, who confirmed it. 
MRK.15.45	After it was confirmed, Pilate consented to give the corpse to Joseph.
MRK.15.46	Joseph purchased a shroud of fine linen and took the body down from the cross. Then he wrapped it in the linen shroud and placed it in a tomb quarried from out of the rock. Then they rolled a large stone over the entrance to seal the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were there and saw exactly where they laid the body of Jesus.
MRK.16.1+MRK.16.2	On the first day of the week, as the Sabbath was ending, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob, and Salome made their way to the tomb. It was very early in the morning as the first streaks of light were beginning to be seen in the sky. They had purchased aromatic embalming spices so that they might anoint his body. 
MRK.16.3	And they had been asking one another, “Who can roll away the heavy stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	But when they arrived, they discovered that the very large stone that had sealed the tomb was already rolled away! 
MRK.16.5	And as they stepped into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, dressed in a long white robe. The women were startled and amazed. 
MRK.16.6	But the angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid. I know that you’re here looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn’t here—he has risen victoriously! Look! See the place where they laid him. 
MRK.16.7	Run and tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is risen. He has gone ahead of you into Galilee and you will see him there, just like he told you.”
MRK.16.8	They staggered out of the tomb, awestruck, with their minds swirling. They ran to tell the disciples, but they were so afraid and deep in wonder, they said nothing to anyone.
MRK.16.9	Early on the first day of the week, after rising from the dead, Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. 
MRK.16.10	After she had seen Jesus, she ran to tell his disciples, who were all emotionally devastated and weeping. 
MRK.16.11	Excitedly, Mary told them, “He’s alive and I’ve seen him!” But even after hearing this, they didn’t believe her.
MRK.16.12	After this, Jesus appeared to two of the disciples, who were on their way to another village, appearing in a form they did not recognize. 
MRK.16.13	They went back 
MRK.16.14	Then Jesus appeared before the eleven apostles as they were eating a meal. He corrected them for having such hard, unbelieving hearts because they did not believe those who saw him after his resurrection.
MRK.16.15	And he said to them, 
MRK.16.19	After saying these things, Jesus was lifted up into heaven and sat down 
MRK.16.20	And the apostles went out announcing the good news everywhere, as the Lord himself consistently worked with them, validating the message they preached with miracle-signs that accompanied them!
LUK.1.1+LUK.1.2+LUK.1.3+LUK.1.4	Dear friend,
LUK.1.1+LUK.1.2+LUK.1.3+LUK.1.4	I am writing for you, mighty lover of God, an orderly account of what Jesus, the Anointed One, accomplished and fulfilled among us. Several eyewitness biographies have already been written, using as their source material the good news preached among us by his early disciples, who became loving servants of the Living Expression. But now I am passing on to you this accurate compilation of my own meticulous investigation based on numerous eyewitness interviews and thorough research of the story of his life. It is appropriate for me to write this, for he also appeared to me so that I would reassure you beyond any shadow of a doubt the reliability of all you have been taught of him.
LUK.1.5	During the reign of King Herod the Great over Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah who served in the temple as part of the priestly order of Abijah. His wife, Elizabeth, was also from a family of priests, being a direct descendant of Aaron. 
LUK.1.6	They were both lovers of God, living virtuously and following the commandments of the Lord fully. 
LUK.1.7	But they were childless since Elizabeth was barren, and now they both were quite old.
LUK.1.8+LUK.1.9	One day, while Zechariah’s priestly order was on duty and he was serving as priest, it happened by the casting of lots (according to the custom of the priesthood) that the honor fell upon Zechariah to enter into the Holy Place and burn incense before the Lord. 
LUK.1.10	A large crowd of worshipers had gathered to pray outside the temple at the hour when incense was being offered. 
LUK.1.11	All at once an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing just to the right of the altar of incense.
LUK.1.12	Zechariah was startled and overwhelmed with fear. 
LUK.1.13	But the angel reassured him, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! 
LUK.1.14	His birth will bring you much joy and gladness. Many will rejoice because of him. 
LUK.1.15	He will be one of the great ones in the sight of God. He will drink no wine or strong drink, but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even while still in his mother’s womb. 
LUK.1.16	And he will persuade many in Israel to convert and turn back to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	He will go before the Lord as a forerunner, with the same power and anointing as Elijah the prophet. He will be instrumental in turning the hearts of the fathers in tenderness back to their children and the hearts of the disobedient back to the wisdom of their righteous fathers. And he will prepare a 
LUK.1.18	Zechariah asked the angel, “How do you expect me to believe this? I’m an old man and my wife is too old to give me a child. 
LUK.1.19	Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel. I stand beside God himself. He has sent me to announce to you this good news. 
LUK.1.20	But now, since you did not believe my words, you will be stricken silent and unable to speak until the day my words have been fulfilled at their appointed time and a child is born to you. That will be your sign!”
LUK.1.21	Meanwhile, the crowds outside kept expecting him to come out. They were amazed over Zechariah’s delay, wondering what could have happened inside the sanctuary. 
LUK.1.22	When he finally did come out, he tried to talk, but he couldn’t speak a word, and they realized from his gestures that he had seen a vision while in the Holy Place. 
LUK.1.23	He remained mute as he finished his days of priestly ministry in the temple and then went back to his own home. 
LUK.1.24	Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for the next five months. 
LUK.1.25	She said with joy, “See how kind it is of God to gaze upon me and take away the disgrace of my barrenness!”
LUK.1.26+LUK.1.27	During the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent from God’s presence to an unmarried girl named Mary, living in Nazareth, a village in Galilee. She was engaged to a man named Joseph, a true descendant of King David. 
LUK.1.28	Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Grace to you, young woman, for the Lord is with you and so you are anointed with great favor.”
LUK.1.29	Mary was deeply troubled over the words of the angel and bewildered over what this may mean for her. 
LUK.1.30	But the angel reassured her, saying, “Do not yield to your fear, Mary, for the Lord has found delight in you and has chosen to surprise you with a wonderful gift. 
LUK.1.31	You will become pregnant with a baby boy, and you are to name him Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	He will be supreme and will be known as the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will enthrone him as King on his ancestor David’s throne. 
LUK.1.33	He will reign as King of Israel forever, and his reign will have no limit.”
LUK.1.34	Mary said, “But how could this happen? I am still a virgin!”
LUK.1.35	Gabriel answered, “The Spirit of Holiness will fall upon you and almighty God will spread his shadow of power over you in a cloud of glory! This is why the child born to you will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	What’s more, your aged aunt, Elizabeth, has also become pregnant with a son. The ‘barren one’ is now in her sixth month. 
LUK.1.37	Not one promise from God is empty of power, for nothing is impossible with God!”
LUK.1.38	Then Mary responded, saying, “This is amazing! I will be a mother for the Lord! As his servant, I accept whatever he has for me. May everything you have told me come to pass.” And the angel left her.
LUK.1.39	Afterward, Mary arose and hurried off to the hill country of Judea, to the village where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived. 
LUK.1.40	Arriving at their home, Mary entered the house and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	At the moment she heard Mary’s voice, the baby within Elizabeth’s womb jumped and kicked. And suddenly, Elizabeth was filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit! 
LUK.1.42	With a loud voice she 
LUK.1.42	“Mary! You are a woman given the highest favor
LUK.1.42	and privilege above all others.
LUK.1.42	For your child is destined to bring God great delight.
LUK.1.43	How did I deserve such a remarkable honor
LUK.1.43	to have the mother of my Lord come and visit me?
LUK.1.44	The moment you came in the door and greeted me,
LUK.1.44	my baby danced inside me with ecstatic joy!
LUK.1.45	Great favor is upon you, for you have believed
LUK.1.45	every word spoken to you from the Lord.”
LUK.1.46	And Mary sang this song:
LUK.1.46	“My soul is ecstatic, overflowing with praises to God!
LUK.1.47	My spirit bursts with joy over my life-giving God!
LUK.1.48	For he set his tender gaze upon me, his lowly servant girl.
LUK.1.48	And from here on, everyone will know
LUK.1.48	that I have been favored and blessed.
LUK.1.49	The Mighty One has worked a mighty miracle for me;
LUK.1.49	holy is his name!
LUK.1.50	Mercy kisses all his godly lovers,
LUK.1.50	from one generation to the next.
LUK.1.51	Mighty power flows from him
LUK.1.51	to scatter all those who walk in pride.
LUK.1.52	Powerful princes he tears from their thrones
LUK.1.52	and he lifts up the lowly 
LUK.1.53	Those who hunger for him will always be filled,
LUK.1.53	but the smug and self-satisfied he will send away empty.
LUK.1.54	Because he can never forget to show mercy,
LUK.1.54	he has helped his chosen servant, Israel,
LUK.1.55	Keeping his promises to Abraham
LUK.1.55	and to his descendants forever.”
LUK.1.56	Before going home, Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months.
LUK.1.57	When Elizabeth’s pregnancy was full term, she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	All her family, friends, and neighbors heard about it, and they too were overjoyed, for they realized that the Lord had showered such wonderful mercy upon her.
LUK.1.59	When the baby was eight days old, according to their custom, all the family and friends came together for the circumcision ceremony. Everyone was convinced that the parents would name the baby Zechariah, after his father. 
LUK.1.60	But Elizabeth spoke up and said, “No, he has to be named John!”
LUK.1.61	“What?” they exclaimed. “No one in your family line has that name!”
LUK.1.62	So they gestured to the baby’s father to ask what to name the child. 
LUK.1.63	After motioning for a writing tablet, in amazement of all, he wrote, “His name is John.”
LUK.1.64	Instantly Zechariah could speak again. And his first words were praises to the Lord.
LUK.1.65	The fear of God then fell on the people of their village, and the news of this astounding event traveled throughout the hill country of Judea. Everyone was in awe over it! 
LUK.1.66	All who heard this news were astonished and wondered, “
LUK.1.67	Then Zechariah was filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit and he prophesied, saying:
LUK.1.68	“Praise be to the exalted Lord God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	for he has seen us through eyes of grace,
LUK.1.68	and he comes as our Hero-God to set us free!
LUK.1.69	He appears to us as a mighty Savior,
LUK.1.69	a trumpet of redemption from the house of David, his servant,
LUK.1.70	Just as he promised long ago
LUK.1.70	by the words of his holy prophets.
LUK.1.71	They prophesied he would come one day and save us
LUK.1.71	from every one of our enemies
LUK.1.71	and from the power of those who hate us.
LUK.1.72	Now he has shown us the mercy promised to our ancestors,
LUK.1.72	for he has remembered his holy covenant.
LUK.1.73+LUK.1.74+LUK.1.75	He has rescued us from the power of our enemies!
LUK.1.73+LUK.1.74+LUK.1.75	This fulfills the sacred oath he made with our father Abraham.
LUK.1.73+LUK.1.74+LUK.1.75	Now we can boldly worship God with holy lives,
LUK.1.73+LUK.1.74+LUK.1.75	living in purity as priests in his presence every day!
LUK.1.76	And to you I prophesy, my little son,
LUK.1.76	you will be known as the prophet of the glorious God.
LUK.1.76	For you will be a forerunner,
LUK.1.76	going before the face of the Master, Yahweh,
LUK.1.76	to prepare hearts to embrace his ways.
LUK.1.77	You will preach to his people the revelation of salvation life,
LUK.1.77	the cancellation of all our sins, 
LUK.1.78	The splendor light of heaven’s glorious sunrise
LUK.1.78	is about to break upon us in holy visitation,
LUK.1.78	all because the merciful heart of our God is so very tender.
LUK.1.79	The word from heaven will come to us
LUK.1.79	with dazzling light to shine upon those
LUK.1.79	who live in darkness, near death’s dark shadow.
LUK.1.79	And he will illuminate the path that leads to the way of peace.”
LUK.1.80	Afterward, their son grew up and was strengthened by the Holy Spirit and he grew in his love for God. John chose to live in the lonely wilderness until the day came when he was to be displayed publicly to Israel.
LUK.2.1+LUK.2.2	During those days, the Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus, ordered that the first census be taken throughout his empire. (Quirinius was the governor of Syria at that time.) 
LUK.2.3	Everyone had to travel to his or her hometown to complete the mandatory census. 
LUK.2.4+LUK.2.5	So Joseph and his fiancé, Mary, left Nazareth, a village in Galilee, and journeyed to their hometown in Judea, to the village of Bethlehem, King David’s ancient home. They were required to register there, since they were both direct descendants of David. Mary was pregnant and nearly ready to give birth.
LUK.2.6+LUK.2.7	When they arrived in Bethlehem, Mary went into labor, and there she gave birth to her firstborn son. After wrapping the newborn baby in strips of cloth, they laid him in a feeding trough since there was no available space in any upper room in the village.
LUK.2.8	That night, in a field near Bethlehem, there were shepherds watching over their flocks. 
LUK.2.9	Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared in radiant splendor before them, lighting up the field with the blazing glory of God, and the shepherds were terrified! 
LUK.2.10	But the angel reassured them, saying, “Don’t be afraid. For I have come to bring you good news, the most joyous news the world has ever heard! And it is for everyone everywhere! 
LUK.2.11	For today in Bethlehem a rescuer was born for you. He is the Lord Yahweh, the Messiah. 
LUK.2.12	You will recognize him by this miracle sign: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a feeding trough!”
LUK.2.13	Then all at once, a vast number of glorious angels appeared, the very armies of heaven! And they all praised God, singing:
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in the highest realms of heaven!
LUK.2.14	For there is peace and a good hope given to the sons of men.”
LUK.2.15	When the choir of angels disappeared back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go! Let’s hurry and find this Word that is born in Bethlehem and see for ourselves what the Lord has revealed to us.” 
LUK.2.16	So they ran into the village and found their way to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in a feeding trough.
LUK.2.17	Upon seeing this miraculous sign, the shepherds recounted what had just happened. 
LUK.2.18	Everyone who heard the shepherds’ story was astonished by what they were told.
LUK.2.19	But Mary treasured all these things in her heart and often pondered what they meant.
LUK.2.20	The shepherds returned to their flock, ecstatic over what had happened. They praised God and glorified him for all they had heard and seen for themselves, just like the angel had said.
LUK.2.21	On the day of the baby’s circumcision ceremony, eight days after his birth, his parents gave him the name Jesus, the name prophesied by the angel before he was born. 
LUK.2.22	After Mary’s days of purification had ended, it was time for her to come to the temple with a sacrifice, according to the law of Moses after the birth of a son. So Mary and Joseph took the baby Jesus to Jerusalem to be dedicated before the Lord. 
LUK.2.23	For it is required in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male shall be a set-apart one for God.” 
LUK.2.24	And, to offer a prescribed sacrifice, “either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”
LUK.2.25	As they came to the temple to fulfill this requirement, an 
LUK.2.26	For the Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he saw the Messiah, the Anointed One of God. 
LUK.2.27	For this reason the Holy Spirit had moved him to be in the temple court at the very moment Jesus’ parents entered to fulfill the requirement of the sacrifice.
LUK.2.28	Simeon cradled the baby in his arms and praised God and prophesied, saying:
LUK.2.29+LUK.2.30+LUK.2.31	“Lord and Master, I am your loving servant,
LUK.2.29+LUK.2.30+LUK.2.31	and now I can die content,
LUK.2.29+LUK.2.30+LUK.2.31	for your promise to me has been fulfilled.
LUK.2.29+LUK.2.30+LUK.2.31	With my own eyes I have seen your Word,
LUK.2.29+LUK.2.30+LUK.2.31	the Savior you sent into the world.
LUK.2.32	He will be glory for your people Israel,
LUK.2.32	and the Revelation Light for all people everywhere!”
LUK.2.33	Mary and Joseph stood there, awestruck over what was being said about their baby.
LUK.2.33	Simeon then blessed them and prophesied over Mary, saying:
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	“A painful sword will one day pierce your inner being,
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	for your child will be rejected by many in Israel.
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	And the destiny of your child is this:
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	he will be laid down as a miracle sign
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	for the downfall and resurrection of many in Israel.
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	Many will oppose this sign, but it will expose to all
LUK.2.34+LUK.2.35	the innermost thoughts of their hearts before God.”
LUK.2.36+LUK.2.37	A prophetess named Anna was also in the temple court that day. She was from the Jewish tribe of Asher and the daughter of Phanuel. Anna was an aged widow who had been married only seven years before her husband passed away. After he died she chose to worship God in the temple continually. For the past eighty-four years she had been serving God with night-and-day prayer and fasting.
LUK.2.38	While Simeon was prophesying over Mary and Joseph and the baby, Anna walked up to them and burst forth with a great chorus of praise to God for the child. And from that day forward she told everyone in Jerusalem who was waiting for their redemption that the anticipated Messiah had come!
LUK.2.39	When Mary and Joseph had completed everything required of them by the law of Moses, they took Jesus and returned to their home in Nazareth in Galilee. 
LUK.2.40	The child grew more powerful in grace, for he was being filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.
LUK.2.41	Every year Jesus’ parents went to worship at Jerusalem during the Passover festival. 
LUK.2.42	When Jesus turned twelve, his parents took him to Jerusalem to observe the Passover, as was their custom. 
LUK.2.43	A full day after they began their journey home, Joseph and Mary realized that Jesus was missing. 
LUK.2.44	They had assumed he was somewhere in their entourage, but he was nowhere to be found. After a frantic search among relatives and friends, 
LUK.2.45	Mary and Joseph returned to Jerusalem to search for him.
LUK.2.46	After being separated from him for three days, they finally found him in the temple, sitting among the Jewish teachers, listening to them and asking questions. 
LUK.2.47	All who heard Jesus speak were astounded at his intelligent understanding of all that was being discussed and at his wise answers to their questions.
LUK.2.48	His parents were shocked to find him there, and Mary scolded him, saying, “Son, your father and I have searched for you everywhere! We have been worried sick over not finding you. Why would you do this to us?”
LUK.2.49	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.2.50	Mary and Joseph didn’t fully understand what Jesus meant.
LUK.2.51	Jesus went with them back home to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother treasured Jesus’ words deeply in her heart. 
LUK.2.52	As Jesus grew, so did his wisdom and maturity. The favor of men increased upon his life, for he was loved greatly by God.
LUK.3.1+LUK.3.2	A powerful message from God came to John, Zechariah’s son, when he was living out in the lonely wilderness. This prophetic commission came to John during the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, son of Caesar. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea at that time. Antipas, son of Herod, was governor over Galilee, Herod’s brother Philip was over the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was over Abilene. This happened during the days of two high priests, Annas and Caiaphas.
LUK.3.3	John went preaching and baptizing throughout the Jordan Valley. He persuaded people to turn away from their sins and turn to God for the freedom of forgiveness.
LUK.3.4	This was to fulfill what was written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
LUK.3.4	“Listen! You will hear a thunderous voice in the lonely wilderness telling you to wake up and get your heart ready for the coming of the Lord Jehovah. Every twisted thing in your lives must be made straight. 
LUK.3.5+LUK.3.6	Every dark way must be brought to the light. Wrongs righted. Injustices removed. Every heart of pride will be humbled low before him. Every deception will be exposed and replaced by the truth so that everyone everywhere will be ready to see the Life of God!”
LUK.3.7	John kept preaching to the many crowds who came out to be baptized, “You are nothing but the offspring of poisonous snakes, full of deception! Have you been warned to repent before the coming wrath of God? 
LUK.3.8	Then turn away from your sins, turn to God, and prove it by a changed life. Don’t think for a moment that it’s enough to simply be the favored descendants of Abraham. 
LUK.3.9	“Even now God’s axe of judgment is poised to chop down your barren tree right down to its roots! And every tree that does not produce good fruit will be leveled and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	The crowd kept asking him, “What then are we supposed to do?”
LUK.3.11	John told them, “Give food to the hungry, clothe the poor, and bless the needy.”
LUK.3.12	Even the despised tax collectors came to John to be baptized, and they asked him, “What are we to do to prove our hearts have changed?”
LUK.3.13	“Be honest,” he replied. “Don’t demand more taxes than what you are required to collect.”
LUK.3.14	“And us?” asked some soldiers. “What about us?”
LUK.3.14	John answered them, “Be content with what you earn. Never extort money or terrify others by threats of violence or be guilty of accusing the innocent.”
LUK.3.15	During those days, everyone was gripped with messianic expectations, believing the Messiah could come at any moment, and many began to wonder if John might be the Christ.
LUK.3.16	But John made it clear by telling them, “There is one coming who is mightier than I. He is supreme. In fact, I’m not worthy of even being his slave. I can only baptize you in this river, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of holiness and into his raging fire. 
LUK.3.17	He has in his hands a winnowing fork to clean up his threshing floor! He will separate the wheat from the chaff. The wheat he will gather into his barn, but he will burn the chaff in a fire that no one can ever put out!”
LUK.3.18	John used many similar warnings as he preached the good news and prepared the people. 
LUK.3.19	He even publicly rebuked Antipas, son of Herod, the governor of Galilee, for the many wicked things he had done. He fearlessly reprimanded him for seducing and marrying his sister-in-law, Herodias.
LUK.3.20	Adding to his many other sins, Herod had John seized and locked up in prison.
LUK.3.21+LUK.3.22	One day Jesus came to be baptized along with all the others. As he was consumed with the spirit of prayer, the heavenly realm ripped open above him and the Holy Spirit descended from heaven in the visible, tangible form of a dove and landed on him. Then God’s audible voice was heard, saying, “My Son, you are my beloved one. Through you I am fulfilled.”
LUK.3.23+LUK.3.24+LUK.3.25+LUK.3.26+LUK.3.27+LUK.3.28+LUK.3.29+LUK.3.30+LUK.3.31+LUK.3.32+LUK.3.33+LUK.3.34+LUK.3.35+LUK.3.36+LUK.3.37+LUK.3.38	Jesus, assumed to be Joseph’s son, was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. Here are the names of Mary’s ancestors, from her father traced all the way back to Adam:
LUK.3.23+LUK.3.24+LUK.3.25+LUK.3.26+LUK.3.27+LUK.3.28+LUK.3.29+LUK.3.30+LUK.3.31+LUK.3.32+LUK.3.33+LUK.3.34+LUK.3.35+LUK.3.36+LUK.3.37+LUK.3.38	Eli, Matthat, Levi, Melki, Jannai, Joseph, Mattathias, Amos, Nahum, Esli, Naggai, Maath, Mattathias, Semein, Josech, Joda, Joanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Shealtiel, Neri, Melchi, Addi, Cosam, Elmadam, Er, Joshua, Eliezer, Jorim, Matthat, Levi, Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim, Melea, Menna, Mattatha, Nathan, David, Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salmon, Nahshon, Amminadab, Admin, Arni, Hezron, Perez, Judah, Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor, Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah, Kenan, Arphaxad, Shem, Noah, Lamech, Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalaleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, and Adam, who was created by God.
LUK.4.1+LUK.4.2	From the moment of his baptism, Jesus was overflowing with the Holy Spirit. He was taken by the Spirit from the Jordan into the lonely wilderness of Judea to experience the ordeal of testing by the accuser for forty days. He ate no food during this time and ended his forty-day fast very hungry. 
LUK.4.3	It was then the devil said to him, “If you are really the Son of God, command this stone to turn into a loaf of bread for you.”
LUK.4.4	Jesus replied, 
LUK.4.5	The devil lifted Jesus high into the sky and in a flash showed him all the kingdoms and regions of the world. 
LUK.4.6+LUK.4.7	The devil then said to Jesus, “All of this, with all its power, authority, and splendor, is mine to give to whomever I wish. Just do one thing and you will have it all. Simply bow down to worship me and it will be yours! You will possess everything!”
LUK.4.8	Jesus rebuked him and said, 
LUK.4.9	Next, the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem and set him on the highest point of the temple and tempted him there, saying, “If you really are the Son of God, jump down in front of all the people. 
LUK.4.10+LUK.4.11	For it is written in the Scriptures, ‘God has given his angels instructions to protect you from harm. For the hands of angels will hold you up and keep you from hurting even one foot on a stone.’ ”
LUK.4.12	Jesus replied, 
LUK.4.13	That finished the devil’s harassment for the time being. So he stood off at a distance, retreating until the time came to return and tempt Jesus again.
LUK.4.14	Then Jesus, armed with the Holy Spirit’s power, returned to Galilee, and his fame spread throughout the region. 
LUK.4.15	He taught in the synagogues and they glorified him.
LUK.4.16+LUK.4.17	When he came to Nazareth, where he had been raised, he went into the synagogue, as he always did on the Sabbath day. When Jesus came to the front to read the Scriptures, they handed him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and read where it is written, 
LUK.4.20	After he read this he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the 
LUK.4.21	Then he added, 
LUK.4.22	Everyone was impressed by how well Jesus spoke, in awe of the beautiful words of grace that came from his lips. 
LUK.4.23	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.4.28	When everyone present heard those words, they erupted with furious rage. 
LUK.4.29	They mobbed Jesus and threw him out of the city, dragging him to the edge of the cliff on the hill on which the city had been built, ready to hurl him off. 
LUK.4.30	But he walked right through the crowd, leaving them all stunned.
LUK.4.31	Jesus went to Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people on the Sabbath day. 
LUK.4.32	His teachings stunned and dazed them, for he spoke with penetrating words that manifested great authority.
LUK.4.33	In the congregation there was a demonized man, who screamed out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	“Hey, you! Go away and leave us alone. I know who you are. You’re Jesus of Nazareth, God’s holy one. Why are you coming to meddle with us? You have come to destroy us already!”
LUK.4.35	Just then the demon hurled the man down on the floor in front of them all. But Jesus rebuked the demon, 
LUK.4.36	Great astonishment swept over the people, and they said among themselves, “What kind of man is this who has such power and authority? With a mere word he commands demons to come out and they obey him!” 
LUK.4.37	The reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in the surrounding region.
LUK.4.38	After leaving the meeting that day, Jesus went into Simon’s house, where Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever. The disciples begged Jesus to help her. 
LUK.4.39	Jesus stood over her and rebuked the fever, and she was healed instantly. Then she got up and began to serve them.
LUK.4.40	At sunset, the people brought all those who were sick to Jesus to be healed. Jesus laid his hands on them one by one, and they were all healed of different ailments and sicknesses.
LUK.4.41	Demons also came out of many of them. The demons knew that Jesus was the Anointed One, so they shouted while coming out, “You are the Messiah, the Son of El Shaddai!” But Jesus rebuked them and commanded them to be silent.
LUK.4.42	At daybreak the next morning, the crowds came and searched everywhere for him, but Jesus had already left to go to a secluded place. When they finally found him, they held him tightly, begging him to stay with them in Capernaum. 
LUK.4.43	But Jesus said, 
LUK.4.44	Jesus continued to travel and preach in the synagogues throughout the land.
LUK.5.1	On one occasion, Jesus was preaching to the crowds on the shore of Lake Galilee. There was a vast multitude of people pushing to get close to Jesus to hear the word of God. 
LUK.5.2	He noticed two fishing boats at the water’s edge, with the fishermen nearby, rinsing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	Jesus climbed into the boat belonging to Simon Peter and asked him, 
LUK.5.4	Jesus sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished, he said to Peter, 
LUK.5.5	“Master,” Peter replied, “we’ve just come back from fishing all night and didn’t catch a thing. But if you insist, we’ll go out again and let down our nets because of your word.”
LUK.5.6	When they pulled up their nets, they were shocked to see a huge catch of fish, so much that their nets were ready to burst! 
LUK.5.7	They waved to their business partners in the other boat for help. They ended up completely filling both boats with fish until their boats began to sink!
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw this 
LUK.5.9+LUK.5.10	Simon Peter and the other fishermen—including his fishing partners, Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee—were awestruck over the miracle catch of fish.
LUK.5.9+LUK.5.10	Jesus answered, 
LUK.5.11	After pulling their boats to the shore, they left everything behind and followed Jesus.
LUK.5.12	One day, while Jesus was ministering in a certain city, he came upon a man covered with leprous sores. When the man recognized Jesus, he fell on his face at Jesus’ feet and begged to be healed, saying, “If you are only willing, you could completely heal me.”
LUK.5.13+LUK.5.14	Jesus reached out and touched him and said, 
LUK.5.13+LUK.5.14	Jesus said, 
LUK.5.15	After this miracle the news about Jesus spread even farther. Massive crowds continually gathered to hear him speak and to be healed from their illnesses. 
LUK.5.16	But Jesus often slipped away from them and went into the wilderness to pray.
LUK.5.17	One day many Jewish religious leaders, known as Pharisees along with many religious scholars came from every village of Galilee, throughout Judea, and even from Jerusalem to hear Jesus teach. And the power of the Lord God surged through him to instantly heal.
LUK.5.18	Some men came to Jesus, carrying a paraplegic man on a stretcher. They attempted to bring him in past the crowd to set him down in front of Jesus. 
LUK.5.19	But because there were so many people crowding the door, they had no way to bring him inside. So they crawled onto the roof, dug their way through the roof tiles, and lowered the man, stretcher and all, into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
LUK.5.20	Seeing the demonstration of their faith, Jesus said to the paraplegic man, 
LUK.5.21	The Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars whispered objections among themselves. “Who does this man think he is to speak such blasphemy? Only God can forgive sins. 
LUK.5.22+LUK.5.23	Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, 
LUK.5.22+LUK.5.23	Jesus turned to the paraplegic man and said, 
LUK.5.25	In an instant, the man rose right before their eyes. He stood, picked up his stretcher, and went home, giving God all the glory with every step he took.
LUK.5.26	The people were seized with astonishment and dumbfounded over what they had just witnessed. And they all praised God, remarking over and over, “Incredible! What an unbelievable miracle we’ve seen today!”
LUK.5.27	Afterward, Jesus went out and looked for a man named Matthew. He found him sitting at his tax booth, for he was a tax collector. Jesus said to him, 
LUK.5.28	That very moment, Matthew got up, left everything behind, and followed him.
LUK.5.29+LUK.5.30	Matthew wanted to throw a banquet to honor Jesus. So he invited Jesus to his home for dinner, along with many tax collectors and other notable sinners. While they were all sitting together at the table, the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law complained to Jesus’ disciples, “Why would you defile yourselves by eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners? 
LUK.5.31	Jesus overheard their complaining and said, 
LUK.5.33	Jesus’ critics questioned him. “John the prophet is known for leading his disciples to frequently fast and pray. As the religious leaders of the land, we do the same. Why do you and your disciples spend most of your time feasting at banquets?”
LUK.5.34	Jesus replied, 
LUK.5.36	And he gave them this illustration: 
LUK.6.1	One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of ripe wheat. His disciples plucked some heads of grain and rubbed the husks off with their hands and ate it. 
LUK.6.2	This infuriated some of the Jewish religious leaders. They said to Jesus, “Why are you allowing your disciples to harvest grain on the Sabbath day? Don’t you know it’s not permissible according to the law?”
LUK.6.3	Jesus replied, 
LUK.6.6+LUK.6.7	On another Sabbath day, Jesus was teaching in the synagogue. In the room with him was a man with a deformed right hand. Everyone watched Jesus closely, especially the Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars, to see if Jesus would heal on a Sabbath day, for they were eager to find a reason to accuse him of breaking the Jewish laws.
LUK.6.8	Jesus, knowing their every thought, said to the man with the deformed hand, 
LUK.6.9	Jesus said to all who were there, 
LUK.6.10	One by one Jesus looked into the eyes of each person in the room. Then he said to the man, 
LUK.6.10	With everyone watching intently, he stretched out his arm, and his hand was completely healed!
LUK.6.11	The room erupted with bitter rage because of this Sabbath-day healing. And from that moment on, the religious leaders plotted among themselves about how they might harm Jesus.
LUK.6.12	After this, Jesus went up into the high hills to spend the whole night in prayer to God. 
LUK.6.13	At daybreak he called together all of his followers and selected twelve from among them, and he appointed them to be his apostles.
LUK.6.14+LUK.6.15+LUK.6.16	Here are their names: Simon, whom he named Peter; Andrew, Peter’s brother; Jacob; John; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; Jacob the son of Alpheus; Simon, known as a fiery political zealot; Judah the son of Jacob; and Judas the locksmith, who later betrayed Jesus.
LUK.6.17	Jesus and his apostles came down from the hillside to a level field, where a large number of his disciples waited, along with a massive crowd of people who had gathered from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal district of Tyre and Sidon. 
LUK.6.18	They had all come to listen to the Manifestation so that they could be healed of their diseases and be set free from the demonic powers that tormented them. 
LUK.6.19	The entire crowd eagerly tried to come near Jesus so they could touch him and be healed, because a tangible supernatural power emanated from him, healing all who came close to him.
LUK.6.20	Looking intently at his followers, Jesus began his sermon. 
LUK.6.37	Jesus said, 
LUK.6.39	Jesus also quoted these proverbs: 
LUK.7.1	After Jesus finished giving revelation to the people on the hillside, he went on to Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2+LUK.7.3	There he found a Roman military captain who had a beloved servant he valued highly, and the servant was sick to the point of death. When the captain heard that Jesus was in the city, he sent some respected Jewish elders to plead with him to come and heal his dying servant. 
LUK.7.4	So they came to Jesus and told him, “The Roman captain is a wonderful man. If anyone deserves to have a visit from you, it is him. Won’t you please come to his home and heal his servant? 
LUK.7.5	For he loves the Jewish people, and he even built our meeting hall for us.”
LUK.7.6+LUK.7.7	Jesus started off with them, but on his way there, he was stopped by friends of the captain, who gave this message: “Master, don’t bother to come to me in person, for I am not good enough for you to enter my home. I’m not worthy enough to even come out to meet one like you. But if you would just release the manifestation of healing right where you are, I know that my young servant will be healed.
LUK.7.8	“Unlike you, I am just an ordinary man. Yet I understand the power of authority, 
LUK.7.9	Jesus marveled at this. He turned around and said to the crowd who had followed him, 
LUK.7.10	Jesus then spoke the healing word from a distance. When the man’s friends returned to the home, they found the servant completely healed and doing fine.
LUK.7.11	Shortly afterward, Jesus left on a journey for the village of Nain, with a massive crowd of people following him, along with his disciples. 
LUK.7.12	As he approached the village, he met a multitude of people in a funeral procession, who were mourning as they carried the body of a young man to the cemetery. The boy was his mother’s only son and she was a widow. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw the grieving mother, his heart broke for her. With great tenderness he said to her, 
LUK.7.14	Then he stepped up to the coffin and touched it. When the pallbearers came to a halt, Jesus said to the corpse, 
LUK.7.15	Immediately, the young man moved, sat up, and spoke to those nearby. Jesus presented the son to his mother, alive! 
LUK.7.16	A tremendous sense of holy mystery swept over the crowd 
LUK.7.17	The news of Jesus and this miracle raced throughout Judea and the entire surrounding region.
LUK.7.18	John’s disciples reported to him 
LUK.7.19	So John dispatched two of his disciples to go and inquire of Jesus. 
LUK.7.20	When they came before the Master, they asked him, “Are you the coming Messiah we’ve been expecting, or are we to continue to look for someone else? John the prophet has sent us to you to seek your answer.”
LUK.7.21	Without answering, Jesus turned to the crowd and healed many of their incurable diseases. His miracle power freed many from their suffering. He restored the gift of sight to the blind, and he drove out demonic spirits from those who were tormented.
LUK.7.22	Only then did Jesus answer the question posed by John’s disciples. 
LUK.7.24	After John’s messengers departed, Jesus spoke about John to the audience crowded around him, saying, 
LUK.7.29	When the common and disreputable people among the audience heard Jesus say this, they acknowledged that it was the truth, for they had already experienced John’s baptism. 
LUK.7.30	But the hearts of the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law had rejected the clear purpose of God by refusing to be baptized by John.
LUK.7.31	Jesus continued, saying, 
LUK.7.36	Afterward, a Jewish religious leader named Simon asked Jesus to his home for dinner. Jesus accepted the invitation. When he went to Simon’s home, he took his place at the table.
LUK.7.37	In the neighborhood there was an immoral woman of the streets, known to all to be a prostitute. When she heard about Jesus being in Simon’s house, she took an exquisite flask made from alabaster, filled it with the most expensive perfume, went right into the home of the Jewish religious leader, and knelt at the feet of Jesus in front of all the guests. 
LUK.7.38	Broken and weeping, she covered his feet with the tears that fell from her face. She kept crying and drying his feet with her long hair. Over and over she kissed Jesus’ feet. Then she opened her flask and anointed his feet with her costly perfume as an act of worship.
LUK.7.39	When Simon saw what was happening, he thought, “This man can’t be a true prophet. If he were really a prophet, he would know what kind of sinful woman is touching him.”
LUK.7.40	Jesus said, 
LUK.7.40	“Go ahead, Teacher. I want to hear it,” he answered.
LUK.7.43	Simon answered, “I suppose it would be the one with the greatest debt forgiven.”
LUK.7.43	 Jesus agreed. 
LUK.7.44	Then he spoke to Simon about the woman still weeping at his feet.
LUK.7.48	Then Jesus said to the woman at his feet, 
LUK.7.49	All the dinner guests said among themselves, “Who is the one who can even forgive sins?”
LUK.7.50	Then Jesus said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	Soon afterward, Jesus began a ministry tour throughout the country, visiting cities and villages to announce the wonderful news of God’s kingdom realm. His twelve disciples traveled with him 
LUK.8.2	and also a number of women who had been healed of many illnesses under his ministry and set free from demonic power. Jesus had cast out seven demons from one woman. Her name was Mary Magdalene, 
LUK.8.3	Joanna, the wife of Chusa, who managed King Herod’s household. Many other women who supported Jesus’ ministry from their own personal finances also traveled with him.
LUK.8.4	Massive crowds gathered from many towns to hear Jesus, and he taught them using metaphors and parables, such as this:
LUK.8.8	 Then Jesus added, shouting out to all who would hear, 
LUK.8.9	Later his disciples came to Jesus and asked him privately what deeper meaning was found in this parable. 
LUK.8.10	He said, 
LUK.8.19	Mary, Jesus’ mother, and her other sons came to where Jesus was teaching, but they couldn’t get through the crowd that had gathered around him. 
LUK.8.20	So he was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak with you.”
LUK.8.21	Jesus told them, 
LUK.8.22+LUK.8.23	One day Jesus said to his disciples, 
LUK.8.24	So the disciples woke Jesus up and said, “Master, Master, we’re sinking! Don’t you care that we’re going to drown?”
LUK.8.24	With great authority Jesus rebuked the howling wind and surging waves, and instantly they stopped and became as smooth as glass. 
LUK.8.25	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.8.25	Shocked and shaken, they said with amazement to one another, “Who is this man who has authority over winds and waves that they obey him?”
LUK.8.26+LUK.8.27+LUK.8.28+LUK.8.29	As soon as they stepped ashore on the eastern side of the lake in the land of the Gerasenes, the disciples were confronted by a demon-possessed madman from a nearby town. Many times he had been put under guard and bound with chains, but repeatedly the many demons inside him had thrown him into convulsions, breaking his shackles and driving him out of the town into the countryside. He had been demonized for a long time and was living naked in a cemetery among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet and screamed out, “What are you doing here? You are Jesus, the Son of the Most High God!”
LUK.8.26+LUK.8.27+LUK.8.28+LUK.8.29	Jesus commanded the demons to come out of him, and they shouted, “We beg you, don’t torture us!”
LUK.8.30	Jesus asked the man, 
LUK.8.30	“Mob,” the demons answered. “We are a mob, for there are many of us here in this man. 
LUK.8.31	We beg you, don’t banish us to the bottomless pit of the Abyss!”
LUK.8.32	On the hillside nearby, there was a large herd of pigs, and the demons pled with Jesus, “Let us enter into the pigs.” 
LUK.8.33	So Jesus ordered all the “mob” of demons to come out of the man and enter the pigs. The crazed herd of swine stampeded over the cliff into the lake and all of them drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the herders tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off in fear and reported it to the nearby town and throughout the countryside. 
LUK.8.35	Then the people of the region came out to see for themselves what had happened. When they came to where Jesus was, they discovered the 
LUK.8.36	Then eyewitnesses to the miracle reported all that they had seen and how the demonized man was completely delivered from his torment.
LUK.8.36	After hearing about such amazing power, the townspeople became frightened. 
LUK.8.37	Soon all the people of the region of the Gerasenes and the surrounding country begged Jesus to leave them, for they were gripped with fear. So Jesus got into the boat, intending to return to Galilee. 
LUK.8.38	But the man who had been set free begged Jesus over and over not to leave, saying, “Let me be with you!”
LUK.8.38	Jesus sent him away with these instructions: 
LUK.8.39	 So the man went away and preached to everyone who would listen about the amazing miracle Jesus had worked in his life.
LUK.8.40	When Jesus returned to Galilee, the crowds were overjoyed, for they had been waiting for him to arrive. 
LUK.8.41+LUK.8.42	Just then, a man named Jairus, the leader of the local Jewish congregation, fell before Jesus’ feet. He desperately begged him to come and heal his twelve-year-old daughter, his only child, because she was at the point of death.
LUK.8.41+LUK.8.42	Jesus started to go with him to his home to see her, but a large crowd surrounded him. 
LUK.8.43	In the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered greatly for twelve years from slow bleeding. Even though she had spent all that she had on healers, she was still suffering. 
LUK.8.44	Pressing in through the crowd, she came up behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his prayer shawl. Instantly her bleeding stopped and she was healed.
LUK.8.45	Jesus suddenly stopped and said to his disciples, 
LUK.8.45	While they all denied it, Peter pointed out, “Master, everyone is touching you, trying to get close to you. The crowds are so thick we can’t walk through all these people without being jostled.”
LUK.8.46	Jesus replied, 
LUK.8.47	When the woman realized she couldn’t hide any longer, she came and fell trembling at Jesus’ feet. Before the entire crowd she declared, “I was desperate to touch you, Jesus, for I knew if I could just touch even the fringe of your robe I would be healed.”
LUK.8.48	Jesus responded, 
LUK.8.49	While Jesus was still speaking to the woman, someone came from Jairus’ house and told him, “There’s no need to bother the Master any further. Your daughter has passed away. She’s gone.”
LUK.8.50	When Jesus heard this, he said, 
LUK.8.51	When they arrived at the house, Jesus allowed only Peter, John, and Jacob—along with the child’s parents—to go inside. 
LUK.8.52	Jesus told those left outside, who were sobbing and wailing with grief, 
LUK.8.53	They laughed at him, knowing for certain that she had died.
LUK.8.54	Jesus approached the body, took the girl by her hand, and called out with a loud voice, 
LUK.8.55+LUK.8.56	Instantly her spirit returned to her body and she stood up.
LUK.8.55+LUK.8.56	Jesus directed her stunned parents to give her something to eat and ordered them not to tell anyone what just happened.
LUK.9.1	Jesus summoned together his twelve apostles and imparted to them authority over every demon and the power to heal every disease. 
LUK.9.2	Then he commissioned them to preach God’s kingdom realm and to heal the sick to demonstrate that the kingdom had arrived. As he sent them out, he gave them these instructions: 
LUK.9.6	The apostles departed and went into the villages with the wonderful news of God’s kingdom realm, and they instantly healed diseases wherever they went.
LUK.9.7	Now, Herod, the governor, was confused and perplexed when he heard the reports of all the miracles of Jesus and his apostles. Many were saying, “John the Baptizer has come back to life!” 
LUK.9.8	Others said, “This has to be Elijah who has reappeared or one of the prophets of old who has risen from the dead.” These were the rumors circulating throughout the land.
LUK.9.8	Herod exclaimed, 
LUK.9.9	“Who is this Man? I keep hearing about him over and over. It can’t be the prophet John; I had him beheaded!” Herod was very eager to meet Jesus.
LUK.9.10	, the apostles returned from their ministry tour and told Jesus all the wonders and miracles they had witnessed. Jesus, wanting to be alone with the Twelve, quietly slipped away with them toward Bethsaida. 
LUK.9.11	But the crowds soon found out about it and took off after him. When they caught up with Jesus, he graciously welcomed them all, taught them more about God’s kingdom realm, and healed all who were sick.
LUK.9.12	As the day wore on, the Twelve came to Jesus and told him, “It’s getting late. You should send the crowds away to the surrounding villages and farms to get something to eat and find shelter for the night. There’s nothing to eat here in the middle of nowhere.”
LUK.9.13	Jesus responded, 
LUK.9.13	They replied, “All we have are these five small loaves of bread and two dried fish. Do you really expect us to go buy food for all these people? 
LUK.9.14	There are nearly five thousand men here, 
LUK.9.14	He told his disciples, 
LUK.9.15+LUK.9.16	After everyone was seated, Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, and gazing into the heavenly realm he gave thanks for the food. Then, in the presence of his disciples, he broke off pieces of bread and fish, and kept giving more to each disciple to give to the crowd. 
LUK.9.17	So everyone ate until they were filled, and afterward the disciples gathered up the leftovers—it came to exactly twelve baskets full!
LUK.9.18	One time, when Jesus was praying in a quiet place with his disciples nearby, he came over to them and asked, 
LUK.9.19	They answered, “Some are convinced you’re the prophet John who has returned. Others say you are Elijah, or perhaps one of the Jewish prophets brought back from the dead.”
LUK.9.20	Jesus asked them, 
LUK.9.20	Peter said, “You are the Anointed One, God’s Messiah!”
LUK.9.21	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone yet, saying, 
LUK.9.23	Jesus said to all of his followers, 
LUK.9.28	Eight days later, Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John and climbed a high mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	As he prayed, his face began to glow until it was a blinding glory streaming from him. His entire body was illuminated with a radiant glory. 
LUK.9.30+LUK.9.31	All at once, two men appeared in glorious splendor: Moses and Elijah. They spoke with Jesus about his soon departure from this world and the things he was destined to accomplish in Jerusalem.
LUK.9.32	Peter and his companions had become very drowsy, but they became fully awake when they saw the glory and splendor of Jesus standing there and the two men with him.
LUK.9.33	As Moses and Elijah were about to return to heaven, Peter impetuously blurted out, “Master, this is amazing to see the three of you together! Why don’t we stay here and set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?”
LUK.9.34	While Peter was still speaking, a radiant cloud of glory formed above them and overshadowed them. As the glory cloud enveloped them, they were struck with fear. 
LUK.9.35	Then the voice of God thundered from within the cloud, “This is my Son, my Beloved One. Listen carefully to all he has to say.”
LUK.9.36	When the thunderous voice faded away and the cloud disappeared, Jesus was standing there alone. Peter, Jacob, and John were speechless and awestruck. But they didn’t say a word to anyone about what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a massive crowd was waiting there to meet them. 
LUK.9.38	And a man in the crowd shouted desperately, “Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my boy. He’s my only child. 
LUK.9.39	He’s possessed by an evil spirit that makes him scream out in torment and hardly ever leaves him alone. It throws him into convulsions and he foams at the mouth. And when it finally does leave him, he’s left with horrible bruises. 
LUK.9.40	I begged your disciples to drive it out of him, but they didn’t have enough power to do it.”
LUK.9.41	Jesus responded, 
LUK.9.42	As the boy approached, the demon slammed him to the ground, throwing him into violent convulsions. Jesus sternly commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and immediately it left. Jesus healed the boy of his injuries and returned him to his father, 
LUK.9.43	Everyone was awestruck. They were stunned seeing the power and majesty of God flow through Jesus.
LUK.9.44	While everyone marveled, trying to process what they had just witnessed, Jesus turned to his disciples and said, 
LUK.9.45	But the disciples were unable to perceive what he was saying, for it was a veiled mystery to them, and they were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.
LUK.9.46	The disciples began to argue and became preoccupied over who would be the greatest one among them. 
LUK.9.47	Fully aware of their innermost thoughts, Jesus called a little child to his side and said to them, 
LUK.9.49	The disciple John said, “Master, we found someone who was casting out demons using your name and we tried to stop him, because he doesn’t follow you like we do.”
LUK.9.50	Jesus responded, 
LUK.9.51	Jesus passionately determined to leave for Jerusalem 
LUK.9.52	So he sent messengers ahead of him as envoys to a village of the Samaritans. 
LUK.9.53	But as they approached the village, they were turned away. They would not allow Jesus to enter, for he was on his way 
LUK.9.54	When the disciples Jacob and John realized what was happening, they came to Jesus and said, “Lord, if you wanted to, you could command fire to fall down from heaven just like Elijah did and destroy all these wicked people.”
LUK.9.55	Jesus rebuked them sharply, saying, 
LUK.9.56	So they went to another village instead.
LUK.9.57	On their way, someone came up to Jesus and said, “I want to follow you wherever you go.”
LUK.9.58	Jesus replied, 
LUK.9.59	Jesus then turned to another and said, 
LUK.9.59	He replied, “Someday I will, Lord, but allow me first to fulfill my duty as a good son and wait until my father passes away.”
LUK.9.60	Jesus told him, 
LUK.9.61	Still another said to him, “Lord, I want to follow you too. But first let me go home and say good-bye to my entire family.”
LUK.9.62	Jesus responded, 
LUK.10.1	After this, the Lord Jesus formed thirty-five teams among the other disciples. Each team was two disciples, seventy in all, and he commissioned them to go ahead of him into every town he was about to visit. 
LUK.10.2	He released them with these instructions:
LUK.10.12	Jesus continued, 
LUK.10.16	Jesus concluded his instructions to the seventy with these words: 
LUK.10.17	When the seventy missionaries returned to Jesus, they were ecstatic with joy, telling him, “Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we commanded them in your name!”
LUK.10.18	Jesus replied, 
LUK.10.21	Then Jesus, overflowing with the Holy Spirit’s anointing of joy, exclaimed, 
LUK.10.23	When Jesus was alone with the Twelve, he said to them, 
LUK.10.25	Just then a religious scholar stood before Jesus in order to test his doctrines. He posed this question: “Teacher, what requirement must I fulfill if I want to live forever in heaven?”
LUK.10.26	Jesus replied, 
LUK.10.27	The religious scholar answered, “It states, ‘You must love the Lord God with all your heart, all your passion, all your energy, and your every thought. And you must love your neighbor as well as you love yourself.’ ”
LUK.10.28	Jesus said, 
LUK.10.29	Wanting to justify himself, he questioned Jesus further, saying, “What do you mean by ‘my neighbor’?”
LUK.10.30	Jesus replied, 
LUK.10.37	The religious scholar responded, “The one who demonstrated kindness and mercy.”
LUK.10.37	Jesus said, 
LUK.10.38+LUK.10.39	As Jesus and the disciples continued on their journey, they came to a village where a woman welcomed Jesus into her home. Her name was Martha and she had a sister named Mary. Mary sat down attentively before the Master, absorbing every revelation he shared. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha became exasperated by finishing the numerous household chores in preparation for her guests, so she interrupted Jesus and said, “Lord, don’t you think it’s unfair that my sister left me to do all the work by myself? You should tell her to get up and help me.”
LUK.10.41	The Lord answered her, 
LUK.11.1	One day, as Jesus was in prayer, one of his disciples came over to him as he finished and said, “Would you teach us a 
LUK.11.2	So Jesus taught them this prayer: 
LUK.11.5	Then Jesus gave this illustration: 
LUK.11.14	One day there was a crowd gathered around Jesus, and among them was a man who was mute. Jesus drove out of the man the spirit that made him unable to speak. Once the demon left him, the mute man’s tongue was loosed and he was able to speak again. The stunned crowd saw it all and marveled in amazement over this miracle!
LUK.11.15	But there were some in the crowd who protested, saying, “He casts out demons by the power of Satan, the demon king.” 
LUK.11.16	Others were skeptical and tried to persuade Jesus to perform a spectacular display of power 
LUK.11.17	Jesus, well aware of their every thought, said to them, 
LUK.11.20	!
LUK.11.27	While he was saying all this, a woman shouted from the crowd, “God bless the one who gave you birth and nursed you as a child!”
LUK.11.28	 said Jesus. 
LUK.11.29	As the crowds swelled even more, Jesus went on to say, 
LUK.11.37+LUK.11.38	After Jesus finished saying this, a Jewish religious leader, one of the “separated ones,” asked him to come for a meal at his home. When everyone had been seated at the table, the religious leader noticed that Jesus hadn’t performed the cleansing ritual before he began eating. He was shocked.
LUK.11.39	The Lord said, 
LUK.11.45	Just then a specialist in interpreting religious law blurted out, “But Teacher, don’t you realize that your words insult me and those of my profession? You’re being rude to us all!”
LUK.11.46	Jesus responded, 
LUK.11.53+LUK.11.54	The religious leaders and experts of the law became enraged and began to furiously oppose him. They harassed Jesus all the way out the door, spewing out their hostility, arguing over everything he said—wanting nothing more than to find a reason to entrap him with his own words.
LUK.12.1	By now a crowd of many thousands had gathered around Jesus. So many people pushed to be near him, they began to trample on one another.
LUK.12.1	Jesus turned to his disciples and warned them, 
LUK.12.13	Just then someone spoke up from the crowd and said, “Master, you should tell my older brother that he has to divide the family inheritance and give me my fair share!”
LUK.12.14	Jesus answered, 
LUK.12.15	Speaking to the people, Jesus continued, 
LUK.12.16	Jesus then gave them this illustration: 
LUK.12.22	Jesus taught his disciples, saying, 
LUK.12.41	“Lord,” Peter asked, “does this apply only to the twelve of us, or is it for everyone else as well?”
LUK.12.42	The Lord said, 
LUK.12.54	Jesus then said to the crowds gathered around him, 
LUK.13.1	Some of those present informed Jesus that Pilate had slaughtered some Galilean Jews while they were offering sacrifices at the temple, mixing their blood with the sacrifices they were offering.
LUK.13.2	Jesus turned and asked the crowd, 
LUK.13.6	Then Jesus told them this parable: 
LUK.13.10	One Sabbath day, while Jesus was teaching in the synagogue, 
LUK.13.11	he encountered a seriously handicapped woman. She was crippled and had been doubled over for eighteen years. Her condition was caused by a demonic spirit of bondage that had left her unable to stand up straight.
LUK.13.12+LUK.13.13	When Jesus saw her condition, he called her over and gently laid his hands on her. Then he said, 
LUK.13.14	The Jewish leader who was in charge of the synagogue was infuriated over Jesus healing on the Sabbath day. “Six days you are to work,” he shouted angrily to the crowd. “Those are the days you should come here for healing, but not on the seventh day!”
LUK.13.15	The Lord said, 
LUK.13.17	When they heard this, his critics were completely humiliated. But the crowds shouted with joy over the glorious things Jesus was doing among them.
LUK.13.18	Jesus taught them this parable: 
LUK.13.20	Jesus taught them another parable: 
LUK.13.22	Jesus ministered in one town and village after another, teaching the people as he made his way toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	A bystander asked him, “Lord, will only a few have eternal life?”
LUK.13.23	Jesus said to the crowd, 
LUK.13.31	Just then some Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus to inform him that Herod was out to kill him and urged him to flee from that place. 
LUK.13.32	Jesus told them, 
LUK.14.1	One day Jesus was on his way to dine with a prominent Jewish religious leader for a Sabbath meal. Everyone was watching him to see if he would heal anyone on the Sabbath. 
LUK.14.2	Just then, standing right in front of him was a man suffering with his limbs swollen with fluid.
LUK.14.3	Jesus asked the experts of the law and the Pharisees who were present, 
LUK.14.4	No one dared to answer. So Jesus turned to the sick man, took hold of him, and released healing to him, then sent him on his way.
LUK.14.5	Jesus said to them all, 
LUK.14.6	There was nothing they could say—all were silenced.
LUK.14.7	When Jesus noticed how the guests for the meal were all vying for the seats of honor, he shared this story with the guests around the table:
LUK.14.12	Then Jesus turned to his host and said, 
LUK.14.15	When they heard this, one of the dinner guests said to Jesus, “Someday God will have a kingdom feast, and how happy and privileged will be the ones who get to share in that joy!”
LUK.14.16	Jesus replied with this parable:
LUK.14.25	As massive crowds followed Jesus, he turned to them and said, 
LUK.15.1	Many dishonest tax collectors and other notorious sinners often gathered around to listen as Jesus taught the people. 
LUK.15.2	This raised concerns with the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law. Indignant, they grumbled and complained, saying, “Look at how this man associates with all these notorious sinners and welcomes them all to come to him!”
LUK.15.3	In response, Jesus gave them this illustration:
LUK.15.7	Jesus continued, 
LUK.15.8	Jesus gave them another parable:
LUK.15.11	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.16.1	Jesus taught his disciples using this story:
LUK.16.8	Jesus continued, 
LUK.16.14	Now, the Jewish religious leaders who were listening to Jesus were lovers of money. They laughed at what he said and mocked his teachings.
LUK.16.15	So Jesus addressed them directly. 
LUK.16.19	Jesus continued. 
LUK.16.29	“
LUK.17.1	One day Jesus taught his disciples this: 
LUK.17.5	Upon hearing this, the apostles said to Jesus, “Lord, you must increase our measure of faith!”
LUK.17.6	Jesus responded, 
LUK.17.7+LUK.17.8	Jesus continued, 
LUK.17.11	Jesus traveled on toward Jerusalem and passed through the border region between Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	As he entered one village, ten men approached him, but they kept their distance, for they were lepers. 
LUK.17.13	They shouted to him, “Mighty Lord, our wonderful Master! Won’t you have mercy on us 
LUK.17.14	When Jesus stopped to look at them, he spoke these words: 
LUK.17.14	They set off, and they were healed while walking along the way. 
LUK.17.15	One of them, 
LUK.17.16	When he found Jesus, he fell down at his feet and thanked him over and over, saying to him, “You are the Messiah.” This man was a Samaritan.
LUK.17.17	 Jesus asked. 
LUK.17.19	Then Jesus said to the healed man lying at his feet, 
LUK.17.20	Jesus was once asked by the Jewish religious leaders, “When will God’s kingdom realm come?”
LUK.17.20	Jesus responded, 
LUK.17.22	Later, Jesus addressed this again with his apostles, saying, 
LUK.17.37	His apostles asked, “Lord, where will this 
LUK.17.37	Jesus responded, 
LUK.18.1	One day Jesus taught the apostles to keep praying and never stop or lose hope. He shared with them this illustration:
LUK.18.6	The Lord continued, 
LUK.18.9	Jesus taught this parable to those who were convinced they were morally upright and those who trusted in their own virtue yet looked down on others with disgust:
LUK.18.15	The people brought their babies and small children to Jesus so that he might lay his hands on them to bless them. When the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents and told them to stop troubling the Master. 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called for the parents, the children, and his disciples to come and listen to him. Then he told them, 
LUK.18.18	One day a wealthy Jewish nobleman of high standing posed this question to Jesus: “Wonderful Teacher, what must I do to be saved and receive eternal life?”
LUK.18.19	Jesus answered, 
LUK.18.21	The wealthy leader replied, “These are the very things I’ve been doing for as long as I can remember.”
LUK.18.22	 Jesus said. 
LUK.18.22	“What is that?” asked the man.
LUK.18.23	When the rich leader heard these words, he was devastated, for he was extremely wealthy.
LUK.18.24	Jesus saw his disappointment, and looking right at him he said, 
LUK.18.26	Those who heard this said, “Then who can be saved?”
LUK.18.27	Jesus responded, 
LUK.18.28	Peter said, “Lord, see how we’ve left all that we have, our houses and our careers, to follow you.”
LUK.18.29+LUK.18.30	Jesus replied, 
LUK.18.31	Jesus took the Twelve aside in private and told them, 
LUK.18.34	The disciples didn’t have a clue what he was saying, for his words were a mystery that was hidden from them.
LUK.18.35	As Jesus and his followers arrived at Jericho, there was a blind beggar sitting on the roadside. 
LUK.18.36	When he heard the crowd approaching, he asked, “What’s all this commotion about?”
LUK.18.37	“It’s Jesus!” they said. “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”
LUK.18.38	The blind beggar shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have pity and show me mercy!”
LUK.18.39	Those who were in the front of the crowd scolded him and warned him to be quiet. But the blind beggar screamed out even louder, “Jesus, Son of David, show me mercy!”
LUK.18.40	Suddenly Jesus stopped. He told those nearby, 
LUK.18.41	“Lord,” he said, “please, I want to see again.”
LUK.18.42	Jesus said, 
LUK.18.43	Instantly he could see again. His eyes popped opened, and he saw Jesus. He shouted loud praises to God and he followed Jesus. And when the crowd saw what happened, they too erupted with shouts of praise to God.
LUK.19.1+LUK.19.2+LUK.19.3	In the city of Jericho there lived a very wealthy man named Zacchaeus, who was the supervisor over all the tax collectors. As Jesus made his way through the city, Zacchaeus was eager to see Jesus. He kept trying to get a look at him, but the crowd around Jesus was massive. Zacchaeus was a very short man and couldn’t see over the heads of the people. 
LUK.19.4	So he ran on ahead of everyone and climbed up a blossoming fig tree so he could get a glimpse of Jesus as he passed by.
LUK.19.5	When Jesus got to that place, he looked up into the tree and said, 
LUK.19.6	So he scurried down the tree and came face-to-face with Jesus.
LUK.19.7	As Jesus left to go with Zacchaeus, many in the crowd complained, “Look at this! Of all the people to have dinner with, he’s going to eat in the house of a crook.”
LUK.19.8	Zacchaeus joyously welcomed Jesus and was amazed over his gracious visit to his home. Zacchaeus stood in front of the Lord and said, “Half of all that I own I will give to the poor. And Lord, if I have cheated anyone, I promise to pay back four times as much as I stole.”
LUK.19.9+LUK.19.10	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.19.11	At this time Jesus was getting close to entering Jerusalem. The crowds that followed him were convinced that God’s kingdom realm would fully manifest when Jesus established it in Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.12	So he told them this story to change their perspective:
LUK.19.28	After saying all of this, Jesus headed straight for Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.29	When he arrived at the stables of Annia near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples ahead, saying, 
LUK.19.32	The two who were sent entered the village and found the colt exactly like Jesus had said. 
LUK.19.33	While they were untying the colt, the owners approached them and asked, “What are you doing?”
LUK.19.34	The disciples replied, “We need this donkey for the Lord of All.”
LUK.19.35+LUK.19.36	They brought the colt to Jesus. Then they placed their prayer shawls on its back, and Jesus rode it as he descended the Mount of Olives toward Jerusalem. As he rode along, people spontaneously threw their prayer shawls on the path in front of him like a carpet.
LUK.19.37	As soon as he got to the bottom of the Mount of Olives, the crowds of his followers shouted with a loud outburst of ecstatic joy over all the mighty wonders of power they had witnessed. 
LUK.19.38	They shouted over and over, “Highest praises to God for the one who comes as King in the name of the Lord! Heaven’s peace and glory from the highest realm 
LUK.19.39	Some Jewish religious leaders who stood off from the procession said to Jesus, “Teacher, you must order your followers at once to stop saying these things!”
LUK.19.40	Jesus responded, 
LUK.19.41	When Jesus caught sight of the city, he burst into tears with uncontrollable weeping over Jerusalem, 
LUK.19.42	saying, 
LUK.19.45	Jesus entered the temple area and forcibly threw out all the merchants from their stalls. 
LUK.19.46	He rebuked them, saying, 
LUK.19.47	From then on Jesus continued teaching in the temple area, but all the while, the high priests, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city kept trying to find a way to accuse Jesus, for they wanted him dead. 
LUK.19.48	They could find no reason to accuse him, for he was a hero to the people and the crowds were awestruck by every word he spoke.
LUK.20.1	One day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts and sharing with the people the wonderful news of salvation. The high priest and the experts of the law were there with the prominent men of the city. They confronted Jesus and asked him, 
LUK.20.2	“We want to know right now by what authority you’re doing this. Who gave you the authority to teach these things here in the temple?”
LUK.20.3	Jesus responded, 
LUK.20.5	His interrogators pulled aside to discuss this among themselves. “What should we say? If we say that John’s mandate was from heaven, he will ask us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘John’s mandate was merely from men,’ then all the people around him will stone us, for they believe John was a prophet of God.” 
LUK.20.7	So they answered Jesus, “We cannot tell where John’s authority came from.”
LUK.20.8	Jesus said, 
LUK.20.9	Jesus taught the people this story:
LUK.20.16	When the people heard this story, they all agreed, “This should never happen!”
LUK.20.17	Jesus looked straight at the people and said, 
LUK.20.19	When the high priests and experts of the law realized that this story was about them, they wanted to have Jesus arrested that very moment, but they were afraid of all the people.
LUK.20.20	So they sent spies who pretended to be honest seekers, but who watched closely for an opportunity to entangle Jesus by his words. Their plan was to catch him saying something against the government, and then they could hand him over to the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities 
LUK.20.21	At the right time they asked him this question: “Teacher, we know that all you say is straightforward and what you teach us is right, giving us the true ways of God. You’re one who doesn’t show favoritism to anyone’s status. So we ask you—
LUK.20.22	is it proper or not to pay taxes 
LUK.20.23	Jesus saw right through their cunning ploy and said, 
LUK.20.24	They answered, “Why, it’s Caesar’s.”
LUK.20.25	Jesus said, 
LUK.20.26	The imposters were left speechless and amazed in the presence of all the people, unable to trap Jesus with his words.
LUK.20.27	Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denies there is a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question: 
LUK.20.28	“Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother’s family line. 
LUK.20.29	But suppose there was a family with seven brothers, and the oldest married and died without children. 
LUK.20.30+LUK.20.31	Then his brother married the widow, but he too died with no children. And so it happened, one brother after another brother, until each of the seven had married the widow and died childless. 
LUK.20.32	Then finally, the widow died too. So here’s our dilemma: 
LUK.20.33	Whose wife will the woman be when she’s resurrected from the dead? Which of the brothers will be her husband, for all seven were once married to her?”
LUK.20.34	Jesus replied, 
LUK.20.39	The experts of the law chimed in, “Yes, Teacher, you speak the truth beautifully.”
LUK.20.40	From then on, the religious Sadducees never dared to ask Jesus a question again.
LUK.20.41	Jesus then posed this question to the people: 
LUK.20.44	Jesus explained, 
LUK.20.45	Within earshot of all the people, Jesus warned his disciples, 
LUK.21.1	Jesus was in the temple, observing all the wealthy wanting to be noticed as they came with their offerings. 
LUK.21.2	He noticed a very poor widow dropping two small copper coins in the offering box. 
LUK.21.3	 he said. 
LUK.21.5	Some of the disciples remarked about the beauty of the temple. They pointed out all the lovely adornments and how it was built with excellence from the gifts given to God.
LUK.21.5	Jesus said, 
LUK.21.7	“Master, tell us,” they asked, “when exactly will this happen? Can you tell us what warning sign to look for when it is about to take place?”
LUK.21.8	Jesus responded, 
LUK.21.10	Jesus continued, 
LUK.21.29+LUK.21.30	Jesus gave his disciples this parable:
LUK.21.37	Each day, Jesus taught in the temple, and he spent his nights on the Mount of Olives. 
LUK.21.38	And all the people came early to the temple courts to listen to the words he taught.
LUK.22.1+LUK.22.2	As the celebration of the Passover Lamb was approaching, the Jewish religious leaders and scholars of the law continually schemed to find a way to murder Jesus without starting a riot—for they feared the crowds.
LUK.22.3	At that time Satan himself entered into Judas the locksmith, who was one of the twelve apostles. 
LUK.22.4	He secretly went to the religious hierarchy and the captains of the temple guards to discuss with them how he could betray Jesus and turn him over to their hands. 
LUK.22.5	The religious hierarchy was elated over Judas’ treachery, and they agreed to give him a sum of money in exchange for Jesus’ betrayal. 
LUK.22.6	Judas vowed that he would find them a suitable opportunity to betray Jesus when he was away from the crowds.
LUK.22.7+LUK.22.8	On the day the sacrifice of the Passover lambs was to take place, Jesus sent for Peter and John and instructed them, 
LUK.22.9	They asked him, “Where do we make the preparations to eat the meal?”
LUK.22.10	Jesus gave them this sign: 
LUK.22.13	They went and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared the Passover meal.
LUK.22.14	When Jesus arrived at the upper room, he took his place at the table along with all the apostles. 
LUK.22.15	Then he told them, 
LUK.22.17	Then he raised a cup and gave thanks to God and said to them, 
LUK.22.19	Then he lifted up a loaf, and after praying a prayer of thanksgiving to God, he gave each of his apostles a piece of bread, saying, 
LUK.22.20	After supper was over, he lifted the cup again and said, 
LUK.22.23	The apostles questioned among themselves which one of them was about to do this.
LUK.22.24	The disciples bickered over which one of them would be considered the greatest in the kingdom. 
LUK.22.25	Jesus interrupted their argument, saying, 
LUK.22.33	“But Lord,” Peter replied, “I am ready to stand with you to the very end, even if it means prison or death!”
LUK.22.34	Jesus looked at him and prophesied, 
LUK.22.35	Then he said to all of them, 
LUK.22.35	“Not a thing,” they answered. “God provided all we needed.”
LUK.22.35	Jesus said, 
LUK.22.38	The disciples told him, “Lord, we already have two swords!”
LUK.22.38	 Jesus responded.
LUK.22.39	Jesus left the upper room with his disciples and, as was his habit, went to the Mount of Olives, 
LUK.22.40	There he told the apostles, 
LUK.22.41	Then he withdrew from them a short distance to be alone. Kneeling down, he prayed, 
LUK.22.43	Jesus called for an angel of glory to strengthen him, and the angel appeared. 
LUK.22.44	He prayed even more passionately, like one being sacrificed, until he was in such intense agony of spirit that his sweat became drops of blood, dripping onto the ground.
LUK.22.45	When Jesus finished praying, he got up and went to his disciples and found them all asleep, for they were exhausted and overwhelmed with sorrow. 
LUK.22.46	 he asked them. 
LUK.22.47	No sooner had he finished speaking when suddenly a mob approached, and right in front of the mob was his disciple Judas. He walked up close to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss. For he had agreed to give the religious leaders a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the one to seize.”
LUK.22.48	Jesus looked at him with sorrow and said, 
LUK.22.49	When the other disciples understood what was happening, they asked, “Lord, shall we fight them with our swords?”
LUK.22.50	Just then, one of the disciples swung his sword at the high priest’s servant and slashed off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	Jesus stopped the incident from escalating any further by shouting, 
LUK.22.52	Jesus turned to those who had come to seize him—the ruling priests, the officers of the temple police, and the religious leaders—and said, 
LUK.22.54	The religious leaders seized Jesus and led him away, but Peter followed from a safe distance. They brought him to the home of the high priest, where people were already gathered out in the courtyard. 
LUK.22.55	Someone had built a fire, so Peter inched closer and sat down among them to stay warm.
LUK.22.56	A girl noticed Peter sitting in the firelight. Staring at him, she pointed him out and said, “This man is one of Jesus’ disciples!”
LUK.22.57	Peter flatly denied it, saying, “What are you talking about, girl? I don’t know him!”
LUK.22.58	A little while later, someone else spotted Peter and said, “I recognize you. You’re one of his, I know it!”
LUK.22.58	Peter again said, “I’m not one of his disciples.”
LUK.22.59	About an hour later, someone else identified Peter and insisted he was a disciple of Jesus, saying, “Look at him! He’s from Galilee, just like Jesus. I know he’s one of them.”
LUK.22.60	But Peter was adamant. “Listen, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t you understand? I don’t even know him.” While the words were still in his mouth, the rooster crowed.
LUK.22.61	At that moment, the Lord, who was being led through the courtyard by his captors, turned around and gazed at Peter. All at once Peter remembered the words Jesus had prophesied over him, 
LUK.22.62	Peter burst into tears, ran off from the crowd, and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	Those who were guarding Jesus mocked and beat him severely. 
LUK.22.64	They also made fun of him, blindfolding him and slapping his face and saying, “Prove that you are a prophet and tell us which one of us hit you!” 
LUK.22.65	They blasphemed and heaped insult after insult upon him.
LUK.22.66	At daybreak the high priests, the experts of the law, and the top religious leaders convened and had Jesus brought before their council. 
LUK.22.67	They asked him point blank, “Tell us, are you the Christ, the Messiah, or not?”
LUK.22.67	Jesus responded, 
LUK.22.70	They all shouted, “Then you do claim to be the Son of God?”
LUK.22.70	He said to them, 
LUK.22.71	They all shouted, “We’ve heard it from his very lips! What further proof do we need?”
LUK.23.1	The entire council stood at once and took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. 
LUK.23.2	They accused him with false testimony before the governor, saying, “This man tells us we’re not to pay our taxes to Caesar. And he proclaims himself to be Christ the King and Messiah. He’s a deceiver of our nation.”
LUK.23.3	Pilate asked Jesus, “Is this true? Are you their king and Messiah?”
LUK.23.3	Jesus answered, 
LUK.23.4	Pilate turned to the high priests and to the gathered crowd and said, “This man has committed no crime. I find nothing wrong with him.”
LUK.23.5	But they yelled and demanded that Pilate do something, saying, “He has stirred up our nation, misleading people from the moment he began teaching in Galilee until he has come here to Jerusalem!”
LUK.23.6+LUK.23.7	When Pilate heard the word Galilee, he asked if Jesus was a Galilean, as he knew that Antipas, son of Herod, was the ruler over Galilee. When they told him yes, Pilate saw a way out of his problem. Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at that time, so Pilate sent Jesus to Antipas.
LUK.23.8	When Antipas saw Jesus, he was elated, for he had heard a great deal about his ministry and wanted Jesus to perform a miracle in front of him. 
LUK.23.9	Antipas questioned him at length, but Jesus wouldn’t even answer him.
LUK.23.10+LUK.23.11	All the while the high priests and religious leaders stood by, hatefully accusing Jesus of wrongdoing, so that Antipas and his soldiers treated him with scorn and mocking. Antipas put an elegant purple robe on Jesus and sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	That day, Antipas, son of Herod, and Pilate healed the rift between themselves due to old hostilities and they became good friends.
LUK.23.13+LUK.23.14	Pilate gathered the people together with the high priests and all the religious leaders of the nation and told them, “You have presented this man to me and charged him with stirring a rebellion among the people. But I say to you that I have examined him here in your presence and have put him on trial. My verdict is that none of the charges you have brought against him are true. I find no fault in him. 
LUK.23.15+LUK.23.16	And I sent him to Antipas, son of Herod, who also, after questioning him, has found him not guilty. Since he has done nothing deserving of death, I have decided to punish him with a severe flogging and release him.” 
LUK.23.17	For it was Pilate’s custom to honor the Jewish holiday by releasing a prisoner.
LUK.23.18	When the crowd heard this, they went wild. Erupting with anger, they cried out, “No! Take this one away and release Barabbas!” 
LUK.23.19	For Barabbas had been thrown in prison for robbery and murder.
LUK.23.20	Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, tried to convince them it was best to let Jesus go. 
LUK.23.21	But they cried out over and over, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.22	A third time, Pilate asked the crowd, “What evil crime has this man committed that I should have him crucified? I haven’t found one thing that warrants a death sentence! I will have him flogged severely and then release him.”
LUK.23.23	But the people and the high priests, shouting like a mob, screamed out at the top of their lungs, “No! Crucify him! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.23	Finally their shouts and screams succeeded. 
LUK.23.24	Pilate caved in to the crowd and ordered that the will of the people be done. 
LUK.23.25	Then he released the guilty murderer Barabbas, as they had insisted, and handed Jesus over to be crucified.
LUK.23.26	As the guards led Jesus to be crucified, there was 
LUK.23.27	Massive crowds gathered to follow Jesus, including a number of women, who were wailing with sorrow over him. 
LUK.23.28	Jesus turned to them and said, 
LUK.23.32	Two criminals were led away with Jesus, and all three were to be executed together. 
LUK.23.33	When they came to the place that is known as The Skull, the guards crucified Jesus, nailing him on the center cross between the two criminals. 
LUK.23.34	While they were nailing Jesus to the cross, he prayed over and over, 
LUK.23.34	The soldiers, after they crucified him, gambled over his clothing.
LUK.23.35	A great crowd gathered to watch what was happening. The religious leaders sneered at Jesus and mocked him, saying, “Look at this man! What kind of ‘chosen Messiah’ is this? He pretended to save others, but he can’t even save himself!”
LUK.23.36	The soldiers joined in the mockery by offering Jesus a drink of vinegar.
LUK.23.37+LUK.23.38	Over Jesus’ head on the cross was written an inscription in Greek, Latin, and Aramaic: “This man is the king of all the Jews.” And all the soldiers laughed and scoffed at him, saying, “Hey! If you’re the king of Jews, why don’t you save yourself?”
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals hanging on the cross next to Jesus kept ridiculing him, saying, “What kind of Messiah are you? Save yourself and save us from this death!”
LUK.23.40	The criminal hanging on the other cross rebuked the man, saying, “Don’t you fear God? You’re about to die! 
LUK.23.41	We deserve to be condemned, for we’re just being repaid for what we’ve done. But this man—he’s done nothing wrong!”
LUK.23.42	Then he said, “I beg of you, my Lord Jesus, show me grace and take me with you into your 
LUK.23.43	Jesus responded, 
LUK.23.44	It was now only midday, yet the whole world became dark for three hours as the light of the sun faded away. 
LUK.23.45	And suddenly in the temple the thick veil hanging in the Holy Place was ripped in two! 
LUK.23.46	Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.23.47	When the Roman captain overseeing the crucifixion witnessed all that took place, he was awestruck and glorified God. Acknowledging what they had done, he said, “I have no doubt; we just killed the righteous one.”
LUK.23.48	The crowds that had gathered to observe this spectacle went back to their homes, overcome with deep sorrow and devastated by what they had witnessed. 
LUK.23.49	But standing off at a distance were some who truly knew Jesus, and the women who had followed him all the way from Galilee were keeping vigil.
LUK.23.50+LUK.23.51	There was also a member of the Jewish council named Joseph, from the village of Ramah, a good-hearted, honorable man who was eager for the appearing of God’s kingdom realm. He had strongly disagreed with the decision of the council to crucify Jesus. 
LUK.23.52	He came before Pilate and asked permission to take the body of Jesus 
LUK.23.53	So he took the body from the cross and wrapped it in a winding sheet of linen and placed it in a new, unused tomb chiseled out of solid rock. 
LUK.23.54	It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was fast approaching.
LUK.23.55	The women who had been companions of Jesus from the beginning saw all this take place and watched as the body was laid in the tomb. 
LUK.23.56	Afterward they returned home and prepared fragrant spices and ointments and were planning to anoint his body after the Sabbath was completed, according to the commandments of the law.
LUK.24.1	Very early that Sunday morning, the women made their way to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared. 
LUK.24.10	Among them were Mary Magdalene; Joanna; and Mary, Jesus’ mother. 
LUK.24.2	Arriving at the tomb they discovered that the huge stone covering the entrance had been rolled aside, 
LUK.24.3	so they went in to look. But the tomb was empty. The body of Jesus was gone!
LUK.24.4	They stood there, stunned and perplexed. Suddenly two men in dazzling white robes shining like lightning appeared above them. 
LUK.24.5	Terrified, the women fell to the ground on their faces.
LUK.24.5	The men in white said to them, “Why would you look for the living One in a tomb? He is not here, for he has risen! 
LUK.24.6	Have you forgotten what he said to you while he was still in Galilee: 
LUK.24.7	‘The Son of Man is destined to be handed over to sinful men to be nailed to a cross, and on the third day he will rise again’?”
LUK.24.8	All at once they remembered his words. 
LUK.24.9	Leaving the tomb, they went to break the news to the Eleven and to all the others of what they had seen and heard.
LUK.24.11	When the disciples heard the testimony of the women, it made no sense, and they were unable to believe what they heard. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter jumped up and ran the entire distance to the tomb to see for himself. Stooping down, he looked inside and discovered it was empty! There was only the linen sheet lying there. Staggered by this, he walked away, wondering what it meant.
LUK.24.13	Later that Sunday, two of Jesus’ disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, a journey of about seventeen miles. 
LUK.24.14+LUK.24.15	They were in the midst of a discussion about all the events of the last few days when Jesus walked up and accompanied them in their journey. 
LUK.24.16	They were unaware that it was Jesus walking alongside them, for God prevented them from recognizing him.
LUK.24.17+LUK.24.18	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.17+LUK.24.18	They stopped, and the one named Cleopas answered, “Haven’t you heard? Are you the only one in Jerusalem unaware of the things that have happened over the last few days?”
LUK.24.19	Jesus asked, 
LUK.24.19	“The things about Jesus, the Man from Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a mighty prophet of God who performed miracles and wonders. His words were powerful and he had great favor with God and the people. 
LUK.24.20+LUK.24.21	But three days ago the high priest and the rulers of the people sentenced him to death and had him crucified. We all hoped that he was the one who would redeem and rescue Israel. 
LUK.24.22	Early this morning, some of the women informed us of something amazing. 
LUK.24.23	They said they went to the tomb and found it empty. They claimed two angels appeared and told them that Jesus is now alive. 
LUK.24.24	Some of us went to see for ourselves and found the tomb exactly like the women said. But no one has seen him.”
LUK.24.25	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.27	Then he carefully unveiled to them the revelation of himself throughout the Scripture. He started from the beginning and explained the writings of Moses and all the prophets, showing how they wrote of him and revealed the truth about himself.
LUK.24.28	As they approached the village, Jesus walked on ahead, telling them he was going on to a distant place. 
LUK.24.29	They urged him to remain there and pleaded, “Stay with us. It will be dark soon.” So Jesus went with them into the village.
LUK.24.30	Joining them at the table for supper, he took bread and blessed it and broke it, then gave it to them. 
LUK.24.31	All at once their eyes were opened and they realized it was Jesus! Then suddenly, in a flash, Jesus vanished from before their eyes!
LUK.24.32	Stunned, they looked at each other and said, “Why didn’t we recognize it was him? Didn’t our hearts burn with the flames of holy passion while we walked beside him? He unveiled for us such profound revelation from the Scriptures!”
LUK.24.33	They left at once and hurried back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples. When they found the Eleven and the other disciples all together, 
LUK.24.34	they overheard them saying, “It’s really true! The Lord has risen from the dead. He even appeared to Peter!” 
LUK.24.35	Then the two disciples told the others what had happened to them on the road to Emmaus and how Jesus had unveiled himself as he broke bread with them.
LUK.24.36+LUK.24.37	While they were still discussing all of this, Jesus suddenly manifested right in front of their eyes! Startled and terrified, the disciples were convinced they were seeing a ghost. Standing there among them he said, 
LUK.24.40	He showed them his pierced hands and feet and let them touch his wounds.
LUK.24.41	The disciples were ecstatic yet dumbfounded, unable to fully comprehend it.
LUK.24.41	Knowing that they were still wondering if he was real, Jesus said, 
LUK.24.42+LUK.24.43	They handed him a piece of broiled fish and some honeycomb. And they watched him eat it.
LUK.24.44	Then he said to them, 
LUK.24.45	He 
LUK.24.46	then said to them, 
LUK.24.50	Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany. He lifted his hands over them and blessed them in his love. 
LUK.24.51	While he was still speaking out words of love and blessing, 
LUK.24.52	And all they could do was worship him.
LUK.24.52	Overwhelmed and ecstatic with joy, they made their way back to Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.53	Every day they went to the temple, praising and worshiping God.
JHN.1.1	In the very beginning the Living Expression was already there.
JHN.1.1	And the Living Expression was with God, yet fully God.
JHN.1.2	They were together—
JHN.1.3	And through his creative inspiration
JHN.1.3	this Living Expression made all things,
JHN.1.3	for nothing has existence apart from him!
JHN.1.4	Life came into being because of him,
JHN.1.4	for his life is light for all humanity.
JHN.1.5	And this Living Expression is the Light that bursts through gloom﻿—
JHN.1.5	the Light that darkness could not diminish!
JHN.1.6	Then suddenly a man appeared who was sent from God,
JHN.1.6	a messenger named John.
JHN.1.7	For he came to be a witness, to point the way to the Light of Life,
JHN.1.7	and to help everyone believe.
JHN.1.8	John was not that Light but he came to show who is.
JHN.1.8	For he was merely a messenger to speak the truth about the Light.
JHN.1.9	For the Light of Truth was about to come into the world
JHN.1.9	and shine upon everyone.
JHN.1.10	He entered into the very world he created,
JHN.1.10	yet the world was unaware.
JHN.1.11	He came to the very people he created—
JHN.1.11	to those who should have recognized him,
JHN.1.11	but they did not receive him.
JHN.1.12	But those who embraced him and took hold of his name
JHN.1.12	were given authority to become
JHN.1.12	the children of God!
JHN.1.13	He was not born by the joining of human parents
JHN.1.13	or from natural means, or by a man’s desire,
JHN.1.13	but he was born of God.
JHN.1.14	And so the Living Expression
JHN.1.14	became a man and lived among us!
JHN.1.14	And we gazed upon the splendor of his glory,
JHN.1.14	the glory of the One and Only
JHN.1.14	who came from the Father overflowing
JHN.1.14	with tender mercy and truth!
JHN.1.15	John taught the truth about him
JHN.1.15	when he announced to the people,
JHN.1.15	“He’s the One! 
JHN.1.15	I told you he would come after me,
JHN.1.15	even though he ranks far above me,
JHN.1.15	for he existed before I was even born.”
JHN.1.16	And now out of his fullness we are fulfilled!
JHN.1.16	And from him we receive grace heaped upon more grace!
JHN.1.17	Moses gave us the Law, but Jesus, the Anointed One,
JHN.1.17	unveils truth wrapped in tender mercy.
JHN.1.18	No one has ever gazed upon the fullness of God’s splendor
JHN.1.18	except the uniquely beloved Son,
JHN.1.18	who is cherished by the Father
JHN.1.18	and held close to his heart.
JHN.1.18	Now he has unfolded to us
JHN.1.18	the full explanation of who God truly is!
JHN.1.19	There were some of the Jewish leaders who sent an entourage of priests and temple servants from Jerusalem to interrogate John. They asked him, “Who are you?”
JHN.1.20	John answered them directly, saying, “I am not the Messiah!”
JHN.1.21	“Then who are you?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”
JHN.1.21	“No,” John replied.
JHN.1.21	So they pressed him further, “Are you the prophet Moses said was coming, the one we’re expecting?” “No,” he replied.
JHN.1.22	“Then who are you?” they demanded. “We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something about yourself—anything!”
JHN.1.23	So, John answered them, 
JHN.1.24	Then some members of the religious sect known as the Pharisees questioned John, 
JHN.1.25	“Why do you baptize the people since you admit you’re not the Christ, Elijah, or the Prophet?”
JHN.1.26+JHN.1.27	John answered them, “I baptize in this river, but the One who will take my place is to be more honored than I, but even when he stands among you, you will not recognize or embrace him! I am not worthy enough to stoop down in front of him and untie his sandals!” 
JHN.1.28	This all took place at Bethany, where John was baptizing at the place of the crossing of the Jordan River.
JHN.1.29	The very next day John saw Jesus coming to him to be baptized, and John cried out, “Look! There he is—God’s Lamb! He will take away the sins of the world! 
JHN.1.30	I told you that a Mighty One would come who is far greater than I am, because he existed long before I was born! 
JHN.1.31	My baptism was for the preparation of his appearing to Israel, even though I’ve yet to experience him.”
JHN.1.32	Then, as John baptized Jesus he spoke these words: “I see the Spirit of God appear like a dove descending from the heavenly realm and landing upon him—and it rested upon him from that moment forward! 
JHN.1.33	And even though I’ve yet to experience him, when I was commissioned to baptize with water God spoke these words to me, ‘One day you will see the Spirit descend and remain upon a man. He will be the One I have sent to baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	And now I have seen with discernment. I can tell you for sure that this man is the Son of God.”
JHN.1.35+JHN.1.36	The very next day John was there again with two of his disciples as Jesus was walking right past them. John, gazing upon him, pointed to Jesus and said, “Look! There’s God’s Lamb!” 
JHN.1.37	And as soon as John’s two disciples heard this, they immediately left John and began to follow a short distance behind Jesus.
JHN.1.38	Then Jesus turned around and saw they were following him and asked, 
JHN.1.39	Jesus answered, 
JHN.1.40+JHN.1.41	One of the two disciples who heard John’s words and began to follow Jesus was a man named Andrew. He went and found his brother, Simon, and told him, “We have found the Anointed One!” (Which is translated, the Christ.) 
JHN.1.42	Then Andrew brought Simon to meet him. When Jesus gazed upon Andrew’s brother, he prophesied to him, 
JHN.1.43	The next day Jesus decided to go to the region of Galilee. There he found Philip and said to him, 
JHN.1.44	(Now Philip, Andrew, and Peter were all from the same village of Bethsaida.) 
JHN.1.45	Then Philip went to look for his friend, Nathanael, and told him, “We’ve found him! We’ve found the One we’ve been waiting for! It’s Jesus, son of Joseph from Nazareth, the Anointed One! He’s the One that Moses and the prophets prophesied would come!”
JHN.1.46	Nathanael sneered, “Nazareth! What good thing could ever come from Nazareth?” Philip answered, “Come and let’s find out!”
JHN.1.47	When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said, 
JHN.1.48	 and said, “But you’ve never met me—how do you know anything about me?”
JHN.1.48	Jesus answered, 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael blurted out, “Teacher, you are truly the Son of God and the King of Israel!”
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered, 
JHN.2.1	Now on the third day there was a wedding feast in the Galilean village of Cana, and the mother of Jesus was there. 
JHN.2.2+JHN.2.3	Jesus and his disciples were all invited to the banquet, but with so many guests in attendance, they ran out of wine. And when Mary realized it, she came to him and asked, “They have no wine, 
JHN.2.4	Jesus replied, 
JHN.2.5	Mary then went to the servers and told them, “Whatever Jesus tells you, make sure that you do it!”
JHN.2.6	Now there were six stone water pots standing nearby. They were meant to be used for the Jewish washing rituals. Each one held about 20 gallons or more. 
JHN.2.7	Jesus came to the servers and told them, 
JHN.2.8	Then he said, 
JHN.2.9	And when they poured out their pitcher for the master of ceremonies to sample, the water became wine! When he tasted the water that became wine, the master of ceremonies was impressed. (Although he didn’t know where the wine had come from, but the servers knew.) 
JHN.2.10	He called the bridegroom over and said to him, “Every host serves his best wine first until everyone has had a cup or two, then he serves the wine of poor quality. But you, my friend, you’ve reserved the most exquisite wine until now!”
JHN.2.11	This miracle in Cana was the first of the many extraordinary miracles Jesus performed in Galilee. This was a sign revealing his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
JHN.2.12	After this, Jesus, his mother and brothers and his disciples went to Capernaum and stayed there for a few days. 
JHN.2.13	But the time was close for the Jewish Passover to begin, so Jesus walked to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	As he went into the temple courtyard, he noticed it was filled with merchants selling oxen, lambs, and doves 
JHN.2.15	So Jesus found some rope and made it into a whip. Then he drove out every one of them and their animals from the courtyard of the temple, and he kicked over their tables filled with money, scattering it everywhere! 
JHN.2.16	And he shouted at the merchants, 
JHN.2.17	That’s when his disciples remembered the Scripture: “I am consumed with a fiery passion to keep your house pure!”
JHN.2.18	But the Jewish religious leaders challenged Jesus, “What authorization do you have to do this sort of thing? If God gave you this kind of authority, what 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered, 
JHN.2.20	Then the Jewish leaders sneered, “This temple took forty-six years to build, and you mean to tell us that you will raise it up in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	 Jesus was speaking of the “temple” of his body. 
JHN.2.22	But the disciples remembered his prophecy after Jesus rose from the dead, and believed both the Scripture and what Jesus had said.
JHN.2.23	While Jesus was at the Passover Feast, 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not yet entrust himself to them, because he knew how fickle human hearts can be. 
JHN.2.25	He didn’t need anyone to tell him about human nature, 
JHN.3.1	Now there was a prominent religious leader among the Jews named Nicodemus, who was part of the sect called the Pharisees and a member of the Jewish ruling council. 
JHN.3.2	One night he discreetly came to Jesus and said, “Master, we know that you are a teacher from God, for no one performs the miracle signs that you do, unless God’s power is with him.”
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said, “Rebirth? How can a gray-headed man be reborn? It’s impossible for a man to go back into the womb a second time and be reborn!”
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	Then Nicodemus replied, “But I don’t understand, what do you mean? How does this happen?”
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.22	Then Jesus and his disciples went out for a length of time into the Judean countryside where they baptized the people. 
JHN.3.23	At this time John was still baptizing people at Aenon, near Salim, where there was plenty of water. And the people kept coming for John to baptize them. 
JHN.3.24	(This was before John was thrown into prison.)
JHN.3.25	An argument then developed between John’s disciples and a particular Jewish man about baptism. 
JHN.3.26	So they went to John and asked him, “Teacher, are you aware that the One you told us about at the crossing place—he’s now baptizing everyone with larger crowds than yours. People are flocking to him! 
JHN.3.27	John answered them, “A person cannot receive even one thing unless God bestows it. 
JHN.3.28	You heard me tell you before that I am not the Messiah, but certainly I am the messenger sent ahead of him. 
JHN.3.29	He is the Bridegroom, and the bride belongs to him. I am the friend of the Bridegroom who stands nearby and listens with great joy to the Bridegroom’s voice. And because of his words my joy is complete and overflows! 
JHN.3.30	So it’s necessary for him to increase and for me to be diminished.
JHN.3.31	“For the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from the natural realm. But the One who comes from above is above everything and speaks of the highest realm of all! 
JHN.3.32	His message is about what he has seen and experienced, even though people don’t accept it. 
JHN.3.33	Yet those who embrace his message know in their hearts that it’s the truth.
JHN.3.34	“The One whom God has sent to represent him will speak the words of God, for God has poured out upon him the fullness of the Holy Spirit without limitation. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves his Son so much that all things have been given into his hands. 
JHN.3.36	Those who trust in the Son possess eternal life; but those who don’t obey the Son will not see life, and God’s anger will rise up against them.”
JHN.4.1	Soon the news reached the Jewish religious leaders known as the Pharisees that Jesus was drawing greater crowds of followers coming to be baptized than John. 
JHN.4.2	(Although Jesus didn’t baptize, but had his disciples baptize the people.) 
JHN.4.3	 heard what was being said and abruptly left Judea and returned to the province of Galilee, 
JHN.4.4	and he had to pass through Samaritan territory.
JHN.4.5	Jesus arrived at the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son, Joseph, long ago. 
JHN.4.6+JHN.4.7+JHN.4.8	Wearied by his long journey, he sat on the edge of Jacob’s well. He sent his disciples into the village to buy food, for it was already afternoon.
JHN.4.6+JHN.4.7+JHN.4.8	Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.9	Surprised, she said, “Why would a Jewish man ask a Samaritan woman for a drink of water?”
JHN.4.10	Jesus replied, 
JHN.4.11	The woman replied, “But sir, you don’t even have a bucket and this well is very deep. So where do you find this ‘living water’? 
JHN.4.12	Do you really think that you are greater than our ancestor Jacob who dug this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and livestock?”
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered, 
JHN.4.15	The woman replied, “Let me drink that water so I’ll never be thirsty again and won’t have to come back here to draw water.”
JHN.4.16	Jesus said, 
JHN.4.17	“But I’m not married,” the woman answered.
JHN.4.17	 Jesus said, 
JHN.4.19	The woman said, “You must be a prophet! 
JHN.4.20	So tell me this: Why do our fathers worship God here on this nearby mountain, but your people teach that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship. Which is right?”
JHN.4.20	Jesus responded, 
JHN.4.25	The woman said, “
JHN.4.26	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.27	At that moment the disciples returned and were stunned to see Jesus speaking with the Samaritan woman. Yet none of them dared to ask him why or what they were discussing. 
JHN.4.28	All at once, the woman dropped her water jar and ran off to her village and told everyone, 
JHN.4.29	“Come and meet a man at the well who told me everything I’ve ever done! He could be the Anointed One we’ve been waiting for.” 
JHN.4.30	Hearing this, the people came streaming out of the village to go see Jesus.
JHN.4.31	Then the disciples began to insist that Jesus eat some of the food they brought back from the village, saying, “Teacher, you must eat something.” 
JHN.4.32	But Jesus told them, 
JHN.4.33	Puzzled by this, the disciples began to discuss among themselves, “Did someone already bring him food? Where did he get this meal?”
JHN.4.34	Then Jesus spoke up and said, 
JHN.4.35	, 
JHN.4.39	So there were many from the Samaritan village who became believers in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony: “He told me everything I ever did!” 
JHN.4.40	Then they begged Jesus to stay with them, so he stayed there for two days, 
JHN.4.41	resulting in many more coming to faith in him because of his teachings.
JHN.4.42	Then the Samaritans said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you told us, but now we’ve heard him ourselves and are convinced that he really is the true Savior of the world!”
JHN.4.43	On the third day Jesus left there and walked to the province of Galilee, 
JHN.4.44	Now Jesus knew that prophets are honored everywhere they go except in their own hometown. 
JHN.4.45	Even so, as Jesus arrived in the province of Galilee, he was welcomed by the people with open arms. Many of them had been in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival and had witnessed firsthand the miracles he had performed.
JHN.4.46+JHN.4.47	Jesus entered the village of Cana of Galilee where he had transformed water into wine. And there was a governmental official in Capernaum who had a son who was very sick and dying. When he heard that Jesus had left Judea and was staying in Cana of Galilee, he decided to make the journey to Cana. When he found Jesus he begged him, “You must come with me to Capernaum and heal my son!”
JHN.4.48	So Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.49	But the man continued to plead, “You have to come with me to Capernaum before my little boy dies!”
JHN.4.50	Then Jesus looked him in the eyes and said, 
JHN.4.50	The man believed in his heart the words of Jesus and set off for home. 
JHN.4.51	When he was still a distance from Capernaum, his servants met him on the road and told him the good news, “Your son is healed! He’s alive!”
JHN.4.52	Overjoyed, the father asked his servants, “When did my son begin to recover?”
JHN.4.52	“Yesterday,” they said, “at one in the afternoon. All at once his fever broke—and now he’s well!”
JHN.4.53	Then the father realized that it was at that very same hour that Jesus spoke the words to him, 
JHN.4.54	This was Jesus’ second extraordinary miracle in Galilee after coming from Judea.
JHN.5.1	Then Jesus returned to Jerusalem to observe one of the Jewish holy days. 
JHN.5.2	Inside the city near the Sheep Gate there is a pool called in Aramaic, The House of Loving Kindness. And this pool is surrounded by five covered porches. 
JHN.5.3	Hundreds of sick people were lying there on the porches—the paralyzed, the blind, and the crippled, all of them waiting for their healing. 
JHN.5.4	For an angel of God would periodically descend into the pool to stir the waters, and the first one who stepped into the pool after the waters swirled would instantly be healed.
JHN.5.5	Now there was a man who had been disabled for thirty-eight years lying among the multitude of the sick. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying there, he knew that the man had been crippled for a long time. So Jesus said to him, 
JHN.5.7	The sick man answered him, “Sir, there’s no way I can get healed, for I have no one who will lower me into the water when the angel comes. As soon as I try to crawl to the edge of the pool, someone else jumps in ahead of me.”
JHN.5.8	Then Jesus said to him, 
JHN.5.9	Immediately he stood up—he was healed! So he rolled up his mat and walked again! Now this miracle took place on the Jewish Sabbath.
JHN.5.10	When the Jewish leaders saw the man walking along carrying his sleeping mat, they objected and said, “What are you doing carrying that? Don’t you know it’s the Sabbath? It’s not lawful for you to carry things on the Sabbath!”
JHN.5.11	He answered them, “The man who healed me told me to pick it up and walk.”
JHN.5.12	“What man?” they asked him. “Who was this man who ordered you to carry something on a Sabbath?” 
JHN.5.13	But the healed man couldn’t give them an answer, for he didn’t yet know who it was since Jesus had already slipped away into the crowd.
JHN.5.14	A short time later, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, 
JHN.5.15	Then the man went to the Jewish leaders to inform them, “It was Jesus who healed me!” 
JHN.5.16	So from that day forward the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus because of the things he did on the Sabbath.
JHN.5.17	Jesus answered his critics by saying, 
JHN.5.18	This infuriated them and made them all the more eager to devise a plan to kill him. For not only did he break their Sabbath rules, but he called God 
JHN.5.19	So Jesus said, 
JHN.6.1	After this Jesus went to the other side of the Lake of Tiberias, which is also known as Lake Galilee. 
JHN.6.2	And a massive crowd of people followed him everywhere. They were attracted by his miracles and the healings they watched him perform. 
JHN.6.3	Jesus went up the slope of a hill and sat down with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	Now it was approaching the time of the Jewish celebration of Passover, 
JHN.6.5	As Jesus sat down, he looked out and saw the massive crowd of people scrambling up the hill, for they wanted to be near him. So he turned to Philip and said, 
JHN.6.6	Now Jesus already knew what he was about to do, but he said this to stretch Philip’s faith.
JHN.6.7	Philip answered, “Well, I suppose if we were to give everyone only a snack, it would cost thousands of dollars to buy enough food!”
JHN.6.8	But just then, Andrew, Peter’s brother, spoke up and said, 
JHN.6.9	“Look! Here’s a young person with five barley loaves and two small fish . . . but how far would that go with this huge crowd?”
JHN.6.10	 Jesus said to his disciples. So on the vast grassy slope, more than five thousand hungry people sat down. 
JHN.6.11	Jesus then took the barley loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to the disciples to distribute to the people. Miraculously, the food multiplied, with everyone eating as much as they wanted!
JHN.6.12	When everyone was satisfied, Jesus told his disciples, 
JHN.6.13	The disciples filled up twelve baskets of fragments, 
JHN.6.14	All the people were astounded as they saw with their own eyes the incredible miracle Jesus had performed! They began to say among themselves, “He really is the One—the true prophet we’ve been expecting!”
JHN.6.15	So Jesus, knowing that they were about to take him and make him their king by force, quickly left and went up the mountainside alone.
JHN.6.16+JHN.6.17	After waiting until evening for Jesus to return, the disciples went down to the lake. But as darkness fell, he still hadn’t returned, so the disciples got into a boat and headed across the lake to Capernaum. 
JHN.6.18	By now a strong wind began to blow and was stirring up the waters. 
JHN.6.19	The disciples had rowed about halfway across the lake when all of a sudden they caught sight of Jesus walking on top of the waves, coming toward them. The disciples panicked, 
JHN.6.20	but Jesus called out to them, 
JHN.6.21	They were relieved to take him in, and the moment Jesus stepped into the boat, they were instantly transported to the other side!
JHN.6.22+JHN.6.23	The next morning, the crowds were still on the opposite shore of the lake, near the place where they had eaten the bread he had multiplied after he had given thanks to God. Yet Jesus was nowhere to be found. They realized that only one boat had been there and that Jesus’ hadn’t boarded, and they concluded that his disciples had left him behind. 
JHN.6.24	So when the people saw on the shoreline a number of small boats from Tiberias and realized Jesus and the disciples weren’t there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to search for him.
JHN.6.25	When they finally found him, they asked him, “Teacher, how did you get here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.28	They replied, “So what should we do if we want to do God’s work?”
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.30+JHN.6.31	They replied, “Show us a miracle so we can see it, and then we’ll believe in you. 
JHN.6.32	 Jesus said, 
JHN.6.34	“Then please, sir, give us this bread every day,” they replied.
JHN.6.35	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.41	When the Jews who were hostile to Jesus heard him say, 
JHN.6.42	“How can he say these things about himself? We know him, and we know his parents. How dare he say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’ ”
JHN.6.43	Jesus responded, 
JHN.6.45	Jesus continued, 
JHN.6.52	These words of Jesus sparked an angry outburst among the Jews. They protested, saying, “Does this man expect us to eat his body?”
JHN.6.53	Jesus replied to them, 
JHN.6.59	Jesus preached this sermon in the synagogue in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	And when many of Jesus’ followers heard these things, it caused a stir. “That’s disgusting!” they said. “How could anybody accept it?”
JHN.6.61	Without anyone telling him, Jesus knew they were outraged and told them, 
JHN.6.64	In fact, Jesus already knew from the beginning who the skeptics were and who his traitor would be.
JHN.6.65	He went on to say, 
JHN.6.66	And so from that time on many of the disciples turned their backs on Jesus and refused to be associated with him. 
JHN.6.67	So Jesus said to his twelve, 
JHN.6.68	Peter spoke up and said, “But Lord, where would we go? No one but you gives us the revelation of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	We’re fully convinced that you are the Anointed One, the Son of the Living God, and we believe in you!”
JHN.6.70	Then Jesus 
JHN.6.71	Jesus was referring to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, for he knew that Judas, one of his chosen disciples, was getting ready to betray him.
JHN.7.1	After this Jesus traveled extensively throughout the province of Galilee, but he avoided the province of Judea, for he knew the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem were plotting to have him killed. 
JHN.7.2	Now the annual Feast of Tabernacles was approaching. 
JHN.7.3	So Jesus’ brothers came to advise him, saying, “Why don’t you leave the countryside villages and go to Judea where the crowds are, so that your followers can see your miracles? 
JHN.7.4	No one can see what you’re doing here in the backwoods of Galilee. How do you expect to be successful and famous if you do all these things in secret? Now is your time—go to Jerusalem, come out of hiding, and show the world who you are!” 
JHN.7.5	His brothers were pushing him, even though they didn’t yet believe in him as the Savior.
JHN.7.6	Jesus responded, 
JHN.7.9+JHN.7.10	Jesus lingered in Galilee until his brothers had left for the feast in Jerusalem. Then later, Jesus took a back road and went into Jerusalem in secret. 
JHN.7.11	During the feast, the Jewish leaders kept looking for Jesus and asking around, “Where is he? Have you seen him?”
JHN.7.12	A controversy was brewing among the people, with so many differing opinions about Jesus. Some were saying, “He’s a good man!” While others weren’t convinced and insisted, saying, “He’s just a demagogue.” 
JHN.7.13	Yet no one was bold enough to speak out publicly on Jesus’ behalf for fear of the Jewish leaders.
JHN.7.14	Not until the feast was half over did Jesus finally appear in the temple courts and begin to teach. 
JHN.7.15	The Jewish leaders were astonished by what he taught and said, “How did this man acquire such knowledge? He wasn’t trained in our schools—who taught him?”
JHN.7.16	So Jesus responded, 
JHN.7.20	Then some in the crowd shouted out, “You must be out of your mind! Who’s trying to kill you?”
JHN.7.21	Jesus replied, 
JHN.7.25	Then some of the residents of Jerusalem spoke up and said, “Isn’t this the one they’re trying to kill? 
JHN.7.26	So why is he here speaking publicly and not one of the Jewish leaders is doing anything about it? Are they starting to think that he’s the Anointed One? 
JHN.7.27	But how could he be, since we know this man is from Galilee, but no one will know where the true Messiah comes from, he’ll just appear out of nowhere.”
JHN.7.28	Knowing all of this, Jesus one day preached 
JHN.7.30	His words caused many to want to arrest him, but no man was able to lay a hand on him, for it wasn’t yet his appointed time. 
JHN.7.31	And there were many people who thought he might be the Messiah. They said, “After all, when the Anointed One appears, could he possibly do more signs and wonders than this man has done?”
JHN.7.32	So when the Pharisees heard these rumors circulating about Jesus, they went with the leading priests and the temple guards to arrest him.
JHN.7.33	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.7.35	When the Jewish leaders heard this, they discussed among themselves, “Where could he possibly go that we won’t be able to find him? Is he going to minister in a different land where our people live scattered among the nations? Is he going to teach those who are not Jews? 
JHN.7.36	What did he really mean by his statement, ‘You will search for me and won’t be able to find me. And where I am you can’t come’?”
JHN.7.37	Then on the most important day of the feast, the last day, Jesus stood and shouted out to the crowds—
JHN.7.39	Jesus was prophesying about the Holy Spirit that believers were being prepared to receive. But the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out upon them, because Jesus had not yet been unveiled in his full splendor.
JHN.7.40	When the crowd heard Jesus’ words, some said, “This man really is a prophet!” 
JHN.7.41	Others said, “He’s the Messiah!” But others said, “How could he be the Anointed One since he’s from Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	Don’t the Scriptures say that he will be one of David’s descendants and be born in Bethlehem, the city of David?” 
JHN.7.43	So the crowd was divided over Jesus, 
JHN.7.44	some wanted him arrested but no one dared to lay a hand on him.
JHN.7.45	So when the temple guards returned to the Pharisees and the leading priests without Jesus, they were questioned, “Where is he? Why didn’t you bring that man back with you?”
JHN.7.46	They answered, “You don’t understand—he speaks amazing things like no one else has ever spoken!”
JHN.7.47	The religious leaders mocked, “Oh, so now you also have been led astray by him? 
JHN.7.48	Do you see even one of us, your leaders, following him? 
JHN.7.49	This ignorant rabble swarms around him because none of them know anything about the Law! They’re all cursed!”
JHN.7.50	Just then, Nicodemus, who had secretly spent time with Jesus, spoke up, for he was a respected voice among them. 
JHN.7.51	He cautioned them, saying, “Does our law decide a man’s guilt before we first hear him and allow him to defend himself?”
JHN.7.52	They argued, “Oh, so now you’re an advocate for this Galilean! Search the Scriptures, Nicodemus, and you’ll see that there’s no mention of a prophet coming out of Galilee!” 
JHN.7.53	and they each went their own way.
JHN.8.1	Jesus walked up the Mount of Olives near the city 
JHN.8.2	Then at dawn Jesus appeared in the temple courts again, and soon all the people gathered around to listen to his words, so he sat down and taught them. 
JHN.8.3	Then in the middle of his teaching, the religious scholars and the Pharisees broke through the crowd and brought a woman who had been caught in the act of committing adultery and made her stand 
JHN.8.4	Then they said to Jesus, “Teacher, we caught this woman in the very act of adultery. 
JHN.8.5	Doesn’t Moses’ law command us to stone to death a woman like this? Tell us, what do you say we should do with her?” 
JHN.8.6	They were only testing Jesus because they hoped to trap him with his own words and accuse him 
JHN.8.6	But Jesus didn’t answer them. Instead he simply bent down and wrote in the dust with his finger. 
JHN.8.7	Angry, they kept insisting that he answer their question, so Jesus stood up and looked at them and said, 
JHN.8.8	And then he bent over again and wrote some more words in the dust.
JHN.8.9	Upon hearing that, her accusers slowly left the crowd one at a time, beginning with the oldest to the youngest, with a convicted conscience. 
JHN.8.10	Until finally, Jesus was left alone with the woman still standing there in front of him. So he stood back up and said to her, 
JHN.8.11	Looking around, she replied, “I see no one, Lord.”
JHN.8.11	Jesus said, 
JHN.8.12	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees were immediately offended and said, “You’re just boasting about yourself! Since we only have your word on this, it makes your testimony invalid!”
JHN.8.14	Jesus responded, 
JHN.8.19	Then they asked, “Just who is this ‘Father’ of yours? Where is he?”
JHN.8.19	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	(Jesus taught all these things while standing 
JHN.8.21	One day Jesus said again, 
JHN.8.22	This so confused the Jewish leaders that they began to say, “Is he planning to commit suicide? What’s he talking about—‘You won’t be able to come where I am going’?”
JHN.8.23	Jesus spoke up and said, 
JHN.8.25	So they asked him plainly, “Who are you?”
JHN.8.25	 Jesus replied. 
JHN.8.27	(Even after all of this, they still didn’t realize that he was speaking about his heavenly Father.)
JHN.8.30	These words caused many 
JHN.8.31	Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him, 
JHN.8.33	Surprised by this, they said, “But we’re the descendants of Abraham and we’re already free. We’ve never been in bondage to anyone. How could you say that we will be released into more freedom?”
JHN.8.34	 Jesus said. 
JHN.8.39	“What do mean?” they replied. “Abraham is our father!”
JHN.8.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.8.41	Indignant, they responded, “What are you talking about? We only have one Father, God himself! We’re not illegitimate!”
JHN.8.42	Jesus said, 
JHN.8.48	“See! We were right all along!” some of the Jewish leaders shouted. “You’re nothing but a demon-possessed Samaritan!”
JHN.8.49	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.52	This prompted the Jewish leaders to say, “Now we know for sure that you’re demon possessed! You just said that those who keep watch over your words will never experience death, but Abraham and all the prophets have died! 
JHN.8.53	Do you think you’re greater than our father Abraham and all the prophets? You are so delusional about yourself that you make yourself greater than you are!”
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.8.57	But many of the Jewish leaders doubted him and said, “What are you talking about? You’re not even fifty years old yet. You talk like you’ve seen Abraham!”
JHN.8.58	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.59	When they heard this, they picked up rocks to stone him, but Jesus concealed himself as he passed through the crowd and went away from there.
JHN.9.1	Afterward, as Jesus walked down the street, he noticed a man blind from birth. 
JHN.9.2	His disciples asked him, “Teacher, whose sin caused this guy’s blindness, his own, or the sin of his parents?”
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.6	Then Jesus spat on the ground and made some clay with his saliva. Then he anointed the blind man’s eyes with the clay. 
JHN.9.7	And he said to the blind man, 
JHN.9.8	This caused quite a stir among the people of the neighborhood, for they noticed the blind beggar was now seeing! They began to say to one another, “Isn’t this the blind man who once sat and begged?” 
JHN.9.9	Some said, “No, it can’t be him!” Others said, “But it looks just like him—it has to be him!” All the while the man kept insisting, “I’m the man who was blind!”
JHN.9.10	Finally, they asked him, “What has happened to you?”
JHN.9.11	He replied, “I met the man named Jesus! He rubbed clay on my eyes and said, ‘Go to the pool named Siloam and wash.’ So I went and while I was washing the clay from my eyes I began to see 
JHN.9.12	So the people of the neighborhood inquired, “Where is this man?”
JHN.9.12	“I have no idea.” the man replied.
JHN.9.13	So the people marched him over to the Pharisees to speak with them. 
JHN.9.14	They were concerned because the miracle Jesus performed by making clay with his saliva and anointing the man’s eyes happened on a Sabbath day, a day that no one was allowed to “work.”
JHN.9.15	Then the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you have your sight restored?”
JHN.9.15	He replied, “A man anointed my eyes with clay, then I washed, and now I can see for the first time in my life!”
JHN.9.16	Then an argument broke out among the Pharisees over the healing of the blind man on the Sabbath. Some said, “This man who performed this healing is clearly not from God! He doesn’t even observe the Sabbath!” Others said, “If Jesus is just an ordinary sinner, how could he perform a miracle like that?”
JHN.9.17	This prompted them to turn on the man healed of blindness, putting him on the spot in front of them all, demanding an answer. They asked, “Who do you say he is—this man who opened your blind eyes?”
JHN.9.17	“He’s a prophet of God!” the man replied.
JHN.9.18	Still refusing to believe that the man had been healed and was truly blind from birth, the Jewish leaders called for the man’s parents to be brought to them.
JHN.9.19+JHN.9.20	So they asked his parents, “Is this your son?”
JHN.9.19+JHN.9.20	“Yes,” they answered.
JHN.9.19+JHN.9.20	“Was he really born blind?”
JHN.9.19+JHN.9.20	“Yes, he was,” they replied.
JHN.9.19+JHN.9.20	So they pressed his parents to answer, “Then how is it that he’s now seeing?”
JHN.9.21	“We have no idea,” they answered. “We don’t know what happened to our son. Ask him, he’s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	(Now the parents were obviously intimidated by the Jewish religious leaders, for they had already announced to the people that if anyone publicly confessed Jesus as the Messiah, they would be excommunicated. 
JHN.9.23	That’s why they told them, “Ask him, he’s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.”)
JHN.9.24	So once again they summoned the man who was healed of blindness and said to him, “Swear to God to tell us the truth! We know the man who healed you is a sinful man! Do you agree?”
JHN.9.25	The healed man replied, “I have no idea what kind of man he is. All I know is that I was blind and now I can see for the first time in my life!”
JHN.9.26	“But what did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he heal you?”
JHN.9.27	The man responded, “I told you once and you didn’t listen to me. Why do you make me repeat it? Are you wanting to be his followers too?”
JHN.9.28	This angered the Jewish leaders. They heaped insults on him, “We can tell you are one of his followers—now we know it! We are true followers of Moses, 
JHN.9.29	for we know that God spoke to Moses directly. But as for this one, we don’t know where he’s coming from!”
JHN.9.30	“Well, what a surprise this is!” the man said. “You don’t even know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes and now I can see! 
JHN.9.31	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but only to godly people who do his will. 
JHN.9.32	Yet who has ever heard of a man born blind that was healed and given his eyesight for the very first time? 
JHN.9.33	I tell you, if this man isn’t from God, he wouldn’t be able to heal me like he has!”
JHN.9.34	Some of the Jewish leaders were enraged and said, “Just who do you think you are to lecture us! You were born a blind, filthy sinner!” So they threw the man out in the street.
JHN.9.35	When Jesus learned they had thrown him out, he went to find him and said to him, 
JHN.9.36	The man whose blind eyes were healed answered, “Who is he, Master? Tell me so that I can place all my faith in him.”
JHN.9.37	Jesus replied, 
JHN.9.38	Then the man threw himself at his feet and worshiped Jesus and said, “Lord, I believe in you!”
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	Some of the Pharisees were standing nearby and overheard these words. They interrupted Jesus and said, “You mean to tell us that we are blind?”
JHN.9.41	Jesus told them, 
JHN.10.1	, 
JHN.10.6	Jesus told the Pharisees this parable even though they didn’t understand a word of what he meant.
JHN.10.7	So Jesus went over it again, 
JHN.10.19	This teaching set off another heated controversy among the Jewish leaders. 
JHN.10.20	Many of them said, “This man is a demon-possessed lunatic! Why would anyone listen to a word he says?” 
JHN.10.21	But then there were others who weren’t so sure: “His teaching is full of insight. These are not the ravings of a madman! How could a demonized man give sight to one born blind?”
JHN.10.22+JHN.10.23	The time came to observe the winter Feast of Renewal in Jerusalem. Jesus walked into the temple area under Solomon’s covered walkway 
JHN.10.24	when the Jewish leaders encircled him and said, “How much longer will you keep us in suspense? Tell us the truth and clarify this for us once and for all. Are you really the Messiah, the Anointed One?”
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.31	When they heard this, the Jewish leaders were so enraged that they picked up rocks to stone him to death. 
JHN.10.32	But Jesus said, 
JHN.10.33	The Jewish leaders responded, “We’re not stoning you for anything good you did—it’s because of your blasphemy! You’re just 
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered, 
JHN.10.39	Once again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped 
JHN.10.40	Then Jesus went back to the place where John had baptized him at the crossing of the Jordan. 
JHN.10.41	Many came out to where he was and said about him, “Even though John didn’t perform any miracles, everything he predicted about this man is true!” 
JHN.10.42	And many people became followers of Jesus at the Jordan and believed in him.
JHN.11.1+JHN.11.2	In the village of Bethany there was a man named Lazarus, and his sisters, Mary and Martha. Mary was the one who would anoint Jesus’ feet with costly perfume and dry his feet with her long hair. One day Lazarus became very sick to the point of death. 
JHN.11.3	So his sisters sent 
JHN.11.4	When he heard this, he said, 
JHN.11.5+JHN.11.6	Now even though Jesus loved Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, he remained where he was for two more days. 
JHN.11.7	Finally, on the third day, he said to his disciples, 
JHN.11.8	“But Teacher,” they said to him, “do you really want to go back there? It was just a short time ago the people of Judea were going to stone you!”
JHN.11.9+JHN.11.10	Jesus replied, 
JHN.11.11	Then Jesus added, 
JHN.11.12	When they heard this, the disciples replied, “Lord, if he has just fallen asleep, then he’ll get better.” 
JHN.11.13	Jesus was speaking about Lazarus’ death, but the disciples presumed he was talking about natural sleep.
JHN.11.14	Then Jesus made it plain to them, 
JHN.11.16	So Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, remarked to the other disciples, “Let’s go so that we can die with him.”
JHN.11.17+JHN.11.18	Now when they arrived at Bethany, which was only about two miles from Jerusalem, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. 
JHN.11.19	Many friends of Mary and Martha had come from the region to console them over the loss of their brother. 
JHN.11.20	And when Martha heard that Jesus was approaching the village, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house.
JHN.11.21	Martha said to Jesus, “My Lord, if only you had come sooner, my brother wouldn’t have died. 
JHN.11.22	But I know that if you were to ask God for anything, he would do it for you.”
JHN.11.23	Jesus told her, 
JHN.11.24	She replied, “Yes, I know he will rise with everyone else on resurrection day.”
JHN.11.25	 Jesus said, 
JHN.11.27	Then Martha replied, “Yes, Lord, I do! I’ve always believed that you are the Anointed One, the Son of God who has come into the world for us!” 
JHN.11.28	Then she left and hurried off to her sister, Mary, and called her aside from all the mourners and whispered to her, “The Master is here and he’s asking for you.”
JHN.11.29	So when Mary heard this, she quickly went off to find him, 
JHN.11.30	for Jesus was lingering outside the village at the same spot where Martha met him. 
JHN.11.31	Now when Mary’s friends who were comforting her noticed how quickly she ran out of the house, they followed her, assuming she was going to the tomb of her brother to mourn.
JHN.11.32	When Mary finally found Jesus outside the village, she fell at his feet in tears and said, “Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
JHN.11.33	When Jesus looked at Mary and saw her weeping at his feet, and all her friends who were with her grieving, he shuddered with emotion and was deeply moved with tenderness and compassion. 
JHN.11.34	He said to them, 
JHN.11.34	“Lord, come with us and we’ll show you,” they replied.
JHN.11.35	Then tears streamed down Jesus’ face.
JHN.11.36	Seeing Jesus weep caused many of the mourners to say, “Look how much he loved Lazarus.” 
JHN.11.37	Yet others said, “Isn’t this the One who opens blind eyes? Why didn’t he do something to keep Lazarus from dying?”
JHN.11.38	Then Jesus, with intense emotions, came to the tomb—a cave with a stone placed over its entrance. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus told them, 
JHN.11.39	Then Martha said, “But Lord, it’s been four days since he died—by now his body is already decomposing!”
JHN.11.40	Jesus looked at her and said, 
JHN.11.41	So they rolled away the heavy stone. Jesus gazed into heaven and said, 
JHN.11.43	Then with a loud voice Jesus shouted with authority: 
JHN.11.44	Then in front of everyone, Lazarus, who had died four days earlier, slowly hobbled out—he still had grave clothes tightly wrapped around his hands and feet and covering his face! Jesus said to them, 
JHN.11.45	From that day forward many of those who had come to visit Mary believed in him, for they had seen with their own eyes this amazing miracle! 
JHN.11.46	But a few went back to inform the Pharisees about what Jesus had done.
JHN.11.47	So the Pharisees and the chief priests called a special meeting of the High Council and said, “So what are we going to do about this man? Look at all the great miracles he’s performing! 
JHN.11.48	If we allow him to continue like this, everyone will believe in him. And the Romans will take action and destroy both our country and our people!”
JHN.11.49	Now Caiaphas, the high priest that year, spoke up and said, “You don’t understand a thing! 
JHN.11.50	Don’t you realize we’d be much better off if this one man were to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish?”
JHN.11.51	(This prophecy that Jesus was destined to die for the Jewish people didn’t come from Caiaphas himself, 
JHN.11.52	And Jesus’ death would not be for the Jewish people only, but to gather together God’s children scattered around the world and unite them as one.) 
JHN.11.53	So from that day on, they were committed to killing Jesus.
JHN.11.54	For this reason Jesus no longer went out in public among the Jews. But he went in the wilderness to a village called Ephraim, where he secluded himself with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	Now the time came for the Passover preparations, and many from the countryside went to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the feast began. 
JHN.11.56	And all the people kept looking out for Jesus, expecting him to come to the city. They said to themselves while they waited in the temple courts, “Do you think that he will dare come to the feast?” 
JHN.11.57	For the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that they be informed immediately if anyone saw Jesus, so they could seize and arrest him.
JHN.12.1	Six days before the Passover began, Jesus went back to Bethany, the town where he raised Lazarus from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	They had prepared a supper for Jesus. Martha served, and Lazarus and Mary were among those at the table. 
JHN.12.3	Mary picked up an alabaster jar filled with nearly a liter of extremely rare and costly perfume—the purest extract of nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet. Then she wiped them dry with her long hair. And the fragrance of the costly oil filled the house. 
JHN.12.4	But Judas the locksmith, Simon’s son, the betrayer, spoke up and said, 
JHN.12.5	“What a waste! We could have sold this perfume for a fortune and given the money to the poor!”
JHN.12.6	(In fact, Judas had no heart for the poor. He only said this because he was a thief and in charge of the money case. He would steal money whenever he wanted from the funds 
JHN.12.7	Jesus said to Judas, 
JHN.12.9	When the word got out that Jesus was not far from Jerusalem, a large crowd came out to see him, and they also wanted to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	This prompted the chief priests to seal their plans to do away with both Jesus and Lazarus, 
JHN.12.11	for his miracle testimony was incontrovertible and was persuading many of the Jews living in Jerusalem to believe in Jesus.
JHN.12.12	The next day the news that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem swept through the massive crowd gathered for the feast. 
JHN.12.13	So they took palm branches and went out to meet him. Everyone was shouting, “Lord, be our Savior! Blessed is the one who comes to us sent from Jehovah-God, the King of Israel!”
JHN.12.14	Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it to fulfill what was prophesied: 
JHN.12.15	“People of Zion, have no fear! Look—it’s your king coming to you riding on a young donkey!”
JHN.12.16	Now Jesus’ disciples didn’t fully understand the importance of what was taking place, but after he was raised and exalted into glory, they understood how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies in the Scriptures that were written about him.
JHN.12.17	All the eyewitnesses of the miracle Jesus performed when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead kept spreading the news about Jesus to everyone. 
JHN.12.18	The news of this miracle of resurrection caused the crowds to swell as great numbers of people 
JHN.12.19	But the Pharisees were disturbed by this and said to each other, “We won’t be able to stop this. The whole world is going to run after him!”
JHN.12.20	Now there were a number of foreigners from among the nations who were worshipers at the feast. 
JHN.12.21	They went to Philip (who came from the village of Bethsaida in Galilee) and they asked him, “Would you take us to see Jesus? We want to see him.” 
JHN.12.22	So Philip went to find Andrew, and then they both went to inform Jesus.
JHN.12.23	He replied to them, 
JHN.12.28	 Then suddenly a booming voice was heard from the sky,
JHN.12.28	“I have glorified my name! And I will glorify it 
JHN.12.29	The audible voice of God startled the crowd standing nearby. Some thought it was only thunder, yet others said, “An angel just spoke to him!”
JHN.12.30	Then Jesus told them, 
JHN.12.33	He said this to indicate that he would die by being lifted up on the cross.
JHN.12.34	People from the crowd spoke up and said, “Die? How could the Anointed One die? The Word of God says that the Anointed One will live with us forever, but you just said that the Son of Man must be lifted up from the earth. And who is this Son of Man anyway?”
JHN.12.35	Jesus replied, 
JHN.12.36	 After saying this, Jesus then entered into the crowd and hid himself from them.
JHN.12.37	Even with the overwhelming evidence of all the many signs and wonders that Jesus had performed in front of them, his critics still refused to believe. 
JHN.12.38	This fulfilled the prophecy given by Isaiah:
JHN.12.38	Lord, who has believed our message? Who has seen the unveiling of your great power?
JHN.12.39	And the people were not able to believe, for Isaiah also prophesied:
JHN.12.40	God has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts to the truth. So with their eyes and hearts closed they cannot understand the truth nor turn to me so that I could instantly cleanse and heal them.
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said these things because he had seen and experienced the splendor of Jesus and prophesied about him. 
JHN.12.42	Yet there were many Jewish leaders who believed in Jesus, but because they feared the Pharisees they kept it secret, so they wouldn’t be ostracized by the assembly of the Jews. 
JHN.12.43	For they loved the glory that men could give them rather than the glory that came from God!
JHN.12.44	Jesus shouted out passionately, 
JHN.13.1	Jesus knew that the night before Passover would be his last night on earth before leaving this world to return to the Father’s side. All throughout his time with his disciples, Jesus had demonstrated a deep and tender love for them. And now he longed to show them the full measure of his love. 
JHN.13.2	Before their evening meal had begun, the accuser had already planted betrayal into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
JHN.13.3	Now Jesus was fully aware that the Father had placed all things under his control, for he had come from God and was about to go back to be with him. 
JHN.13.4	So he got up from the meal and took off his outer robe, and took a towel and wrapped it around his waist. 
JHN.13.5	Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ dirty feet and dry them with his towel.
JHN.13.6	But when Jesus got to Simon Peter, he objected and said, “I can’t let you wash my dirty feet—you’re my Lord!”
JHN.13.7	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.8	Peter looked at Jesus and said, “You’ll never wash my dirty feet—never!”
JHN.13.8	 Jesus responded, 
JHN.13.9	So Peter said, “Lord, in that case, don’t just wash my feet, wash my hands and my head too!”
JHN.13.10	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.13.11	and that’s why he told them that not all of them were clean.
JHN.13.12	After washing their feet, he put his robe on and returned to his place at the table. 
JHN.13.21	Then Jesus was moved deeply in his spirit. Looking at his disciples, he announced, 
JHN.13.22	Eyeing each other, his disciples puzzled over which one of them could do such a thing. 
JHN.13.23	The disciple that Jesus dearly loved was at the right of him at the table and was leaning his head on Jesus. 
JHN.13.24	Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to. 
JHN.13.25	Then the dearly loved disciple leaned into Jesus’ chest and whispered, “Master, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	 Jesus replied. Then he dipped the piece of bread into the bowl and handed it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
JHN.13.27	And when Judas ate the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus looked at Judas and said, 
JHN.13.28	None of those around the table realized what was happening. 
JHN.13.29	Some thought that Judas, their trusted treasurer, was being told to go buy what was needed for the Passover celebration, or perhaps to go give something to the poor. 
JHN.13.30	So Judas left quickly and went out into the dark night to betray Jesus.
JHN.13.31	After Judas left the room, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.36	Peter interjected, “But, Master, where are you going?”
JHN.13.36	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.37	Peter said, “What do you mean I’m not able to follow you now? I would sacrifice my life to die for you!”
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to him, “Master, we don’t know where you’re going, so how could we know the way there?”
JHN.14.6	Jesus explained, 
JHN.14.8	Philip spoke up, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be all that we need!”
JHN.14.9	Jesus replied, 
JHN.14.22	Then one of the disciples named Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, why is it you will only reveal your identity to us and not to everyone?”
JHN.14.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.16.17	Some of the disciples asked each other, “What does he mean, ‘Soon you won’t see me,’ and, ‘A little while after that and you will see me in a new way’? And what does he mean, ‘Because I’m going to my Father’?” 
JHN.16.18	So they kept on repeating, “What’s the meaning of ‘a little while’? We have no clue what he’s talking about!”
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew what they were thinking, and it was obvious that they were anxious to ask him what he had meant, so he spoke up and said, 
JHN.16.29	His disciples said, “At last you’re speaking to us clearly and not using veiled speech and metaphors! 
JHN.16.30	Now we understand that you know everything there is to know, and we don’t need to question you further. And everything you’ve taught us convinces us that you have come directly from God!”
JHN.16.31	Jesus replied, 
JHN.17.1	This is what Jesus prayed as he looked up into heaven,
JHN.18.1	After Jesus finished this prayer; he left with his disciples and went across the Kidron Valley to a place where there was a garden. 
JHN.18.2	Judas, the traitor, knew where this place was, for Jesus had gone there often with his disciples. 
JHN.18.3	The Pharisees and the leading priests had given Judas a large detachment of Roman soldiers and temple police to seize Jesus. Judas guided them to the garden, all of them carrying torches and lanterns and armed 
JHN.18.4	Jesus, knowing full well what was about to happen, went out to the garden entrance to meet them. Stepping forward, he asked, 
JHN.18.5	“Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. (Now Judas, the traitor, was among them.)
JHN.18.5	He replied, 
JHN.18.6	And the moment Jesus spoke the words, 
JHN.18.7	So once more, Jesus asked them, 
JHN.18.7	As they stood up, they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
JHN.18.8	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.9	He said this to fulfill the prophecy he had spoken, 
JHN.18.10	Suddenly, Peter took out his sword and struck the high priest’s servant, slashing off his right ear! The servant’s name was Malchus.
JHN.18.11	Jesus ordered Peter, 
JHN.18.12	Then the soldiers and their captain, along with the Jewish officers, seized Jesus and tied him up. 
JHN.18.13	They took him first to Annas, as he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 
JHN.18.14	Caiaphas was the one who had persuaded the Jewish leaders that it would be better off to have one person die for the sake of the people.
JHN.18.15	Peter and another disciple followed along behind them as they took Jesus into the courtyard of Annas’ palace. Since the other disciple was well known to the high priest, he entered in, 
JHN.18.16	but Peter was left standing outside by the gate. Then the other disciple came back out to the servant girl who was guarding the gate and convinced her to allow Peter inside. 
JHN.18.17	As he passed inside, the young servant girl guarding the gate took a look at Peter and said to him, “Aren’t you one of his disciples?”
JHN.18.17	He denied it, saying, “No! I’m not!”
JHN.18.18	Now because it was cold, the soldiers and guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. So Peter huddled there with them around the fire.
JHN.18.19	The high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his teachings.
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered Annas’ questions by saying, 
JHN.18.22	Just then one of the guards standing near Jesus punched him in the face with his fist and said, “How dare you answer the high priest like that!”
JHN.18.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent Jesus, still tied up, across the way to the high priest Caiaphas.
JHN.18.25	Meanwhile, Peter was still standing in the courtyard by the fire. And one of the guards standing there said to him, “Aren’t you one of his disciples? I know you are!” Peter swore and said, “I am not his disciple!” 
JHN.18.26	But one of the servants of the high priest, a relative to the man whose ear Peter had cut off, looked at him and said, “Wait! Didn’t I see you out there in the garden with Jesus?” 
JHN.18.27	Then Peter denied it the third time and said, “No!”—and at that very same moment, a rooster crowed nearby.
JHN.18.28	Before dawn they took Jesus from his trial before Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s palace. Now the Jews refused to go into the Roman governor’s residence to avoid ceremonial defilement before eating the Passover meal. 
JHN.18.29	So Pilate came outside where they waited and asked them pointedly, “Tell me, what exactly is the accusation that you bring against this man? What has he done?”
JHN.18.30	They answered, “We wouldn’t be coming here to hand over this ‘criminal’ to you if he wasn’t guilty of some wrongdoing!”
JHN.18.31	Pilate said, “Very well, then you take him yourselves and go pass judgment on him according to your Jewish laws!”
JHN.18.31	But the Jewish leaders complained and said, “We don’t have legal authority to put anyone to death. 
JHN.18.32	(This was to fulfill the words of Jesus when he predicted the manner of death that he would die.)
JHN.18.33	Upon hearing this, Pilate went back inside his palace and summoned Jesus. Looking him over, Pilate asked him, “Are you really the king of the Jews?”
JHN.18.34	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.35	Pilate responded, “Only a Jew would care about this; do I look like a Jew? It’s your own people and your religious leaders that have handed you over to me. So tell me, Jesus, what have you done wrong?”
JHN.18.36	Jesus looked at Pilate and said, 
JHN.18.37	Then Pilate responded, “Oh, so then you are a king?”
JHN.18.37	 Jesus said, 
JHN.18.38	Pilate looked at Jesus and said, “What is truth?”
JHN.18.38	As silence filled the room, Pilate went back out to where the Jewish leaders were waiting and said to them, “He’s not guilty. I couldn’t even find one fault with him. 
JHN.18.39	Now, you do know that we have a custom that I release one prisoner every year at Passover—shall I release your king—the king of the Jews?”
JHN.18.40	They shouted out over and over, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a robber and a troublemaker.)
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate ordered Jesus to be brutally beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal. 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers also wove thorn-branches into a crown and set it on his head and placed a purple robe over his shoulders. 
JHN.19.3	Then, one by one, they came in front of him to mock him by saying, “Hail, to the king of the Jews!” And one after the other, they repeatedly punched him in the face.
JHN.19.4	Once more Pilate went out and said to the Jewish officials, “I will bring him out once more so that you know that I’ve found nothing wrong with him.” 
JHN.19.5	So when Jesus emerged, 
JHN.19.6	No sooner did the high priests and the temple guards see Jesus that they all shouted in a frenzy, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.6	Pilate replied, “You take him then and nail him to a cross yourselves! I told you—he’s not guilty! I find no reason to condemn him.”
JHN.19.7	The Jewish leaders shouted back, “But we have the Law! And according to our Law, he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God!”
JHN.19.8	Then Pilate was greatly alarmed when he heard that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God! 
JHN.19.9	So he took Jesus back inside and said to him, “Where have you come from?” But once again, silence filled the room. 
JHN.19.10	Perplexed, Pilate said, “Are you going to play deaf? Don’t you know that I have the power to grant you your freedom or nail you to a tree?”
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	From then on Pilate tried to find a way out of the situation and to set him free, but the Jewish authorities shouted him down: “If you let this man go, you’re no friend of Caesar! Anyone who declares himself a king is an enemy of the emperor!”
JHN.19.13	So when Pilate heard this threat, he relented and had Jesus, 
JHN.19.14	And it was now almost noon. And it was the same day they were preparing to slay the Passover lambs.
JHN.19.14	Then Pilate said to the Jewish officials, “Look! Here is your king!”
JHN.19.15	But they screamed out, “Take him away! Take him away and crucify him!”
JHN.19.15	Pilate replied, “Shall I nail your king to a cross?”
JHN.19.15	The high priests answered, “We have no other king but Caesar!”
JHN.19.16	Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them. So the soldiers seized him and took him away to be crucified.
JHN.19.17	Jesus carried his own cross out of the city to the place called “The Skull,” which in Aramaic is Golgotha. 
JHN.19.18	And there they nailed him to the cross. He was crucified, along with two others, one on each side with Jesus in the middle. 
JHN.19.19+JHN.19.20	Pilate had them post a sign over the cross, which was written in three languages—Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. Many of the people of Jerusalem read the sign, for he was crucified near the city. The sign stated: “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”
JHN.19.21	But the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “You must change the sign! Don’t let it say, ‘King of the Jews,’ but rather—‘he claimed to be the King of the Jews!’ ” 
JHN.19.22	Pilate responded, “What I have written will remain!”
JHN.19.23	Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they divided up his clothes into four shares, one for each of them. But his tunic was seamless, woven from the top to the bottom as a single garment. 
JHN.19.24	So the soldiers said to each other, “Don’t tear it—let’s throw dice to see who gets it!” The soldiers did all of this not knowing they fulfilled the Scripture that says, “They divided my garments among them and gambled for my garment.”
JHN.19.25	Mary, Jesus’ mother, was standing next to his cross, along with Mary’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
JHN.19.26	So when Jesus looked down and saw the disciple he loved standing with her, he said, 
JHN.19.27	Then he said, 
JHN.19.28	Jesus knew that his mission was accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said: 
JHN.19.29	A jar of sour wine was sitting nearby, so they soaked a sponge with it and put it on the stalk of hyssop and raised it to his lips. 
JHN.19.30	When he had sipped the sour wine, he said, 
JHN.19.31	The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies of the victims to remain on the cross through the next day, since it was the day of preparation for a very important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate’s permission to have the victims’ legs broken 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers broke the legs of the two men who were nailed there. 
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus, they realized that he had already died, so they decided not to break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers took a spear and pierced Jesus’ side, and blood and water gushed out.
JHN.19.35	(I, John, do testify to the certainty of what took place, and I write the truth so that you might also believe.) 
JHN.19.36	For all these things happened to fulfill the prophecies of the Scriptures:
JHN.19.36	“Not one of his bones will be broken,”
JHN.19.37	and, “They will gaze on the one they have pierced!”
JHN.19.38	After this, Joseph from the city of Ramah, who was a secret disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jewish authorities, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. So Pilate granted him permission to remove the body from the cross. 
JHN.19.39	Now Nicodemus, who had once come to Jesus privately at night, accompanied Joseph, and together they carried a significant amount of myrrh and aloes to the cross. 
JHN.19.40	Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it in strips of linen with the embalming spices according to the Jewish burial customs. 
JHN.19.41	Near the place where Jesus was crucified was a garden, and in the garden there was a new tomb where no one had yet been laid to rest. 
JHN.19.42	And because the Sabbath was approaching, and the tomb was nearby, that’s where they laid the body of Jesus.
JHN.20.1	Very early Sunday morning, before sunrise, Mary Magdalene made her way to the tomb. And when she arrived she discovered that the stone that sealed the entrance to the tomb was moved away! 
JHN.20.2	So she went running as fast as she could to go tell Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved. She told them, “They’ve taken the Lord’s body from the tomb, and we don’t know where he is!”
JHN.20.3	Then Peter and the other disciple jumped up and ran to the tomb to go see for themselves. 
JHN.20.4	They started out together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	He didn’t enter the tomb, but peeked in, and saw only the linen cloths lying there. 
JHN.20.6	Then Peter came behind him and went right into the tomb. He too noticed the linen cloths lying there, 
JHN.20.7	but the burial cloth that had been on Jesus’ head had been rolled up and placed separate from the other cloths.
JHN.20.8	Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went in, and after one look, he believed! 
JHN.20.9	For until then they hadn’t understood the Scriptures that prophesied that he was destined to rise from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	Puzzled, Peter and the other disciple then left and went back to their homes.
JHN.20.11	Mary arrived 
JHN.20.12	she saw two angels in dazzling white robes, sitting where Jesus’ body had been laid—one at the head and one at the feet!
JHN.20.13	“Dear woman, why are you crying?” they asked.
JHN.20.13	Mary answered, “They have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they’ve laid him.”
JHN.20.14	Then she turned around to leave, and there was Jesus standing in front of her, but she didn’t realize that it was him!
JHN.20.15	He said to her, 
JHN.20.15	Mary answered, thinking he was only the gardener, “Sir, if you have taken his body somewhere else, tell me, and I will go and . . .”
JHN.20.16	 Jesus interrupted her.
JHN.20.16	Turning to face him, she said, “Rabboni!” (Aramaic for “my teacher”)
JHN.20.17	Jesus cautioned her, 
JHN.20.18	Then Mary Magdalene left to inform the disciples of her encounter with Jesus. “I have seen the Lord!” she told them. And she gave them his message.
JHN.20.19	That evening, the disciples gathered together. And because they were afraid of reprisals from the Jewish leaders, they had locked the doors to the place where they met. But suddenly Jesus appeared among them and said, 
JHN.20.20	Then he showed them the wounds of his hands and his side—they were overjoyed to see the Lord with their own eyes!
JHN.20.21	Jesus repeated his greeting, 
JHN.20.22	Then, taking a deep breath, he blew on them and said, 
JHN.20.24	One of the twelve wasn’t present when Jesus appeared to them—it was Thomas, whose nickname was “the Twin.” 
JHN.20.25	So the disciples informed him, “We have seen the Lord with our own eyes!”
JHN.20.25	Still unconvinced, Thomas replied, “There’s no way I’m going to believe this unless I personally see the wounds of the nails in his hands, touch them with my finger, and put my hand into the wound of his side where he was pierced!”
JHN.20.26	Then eight days later, Thomas and all the others were in the house together. And even though all the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly stood before them! 
JHN.20.27	Then, looking into Thomas’ eyes, he said, 
JHN.20.28	Then the words spilled out of his heart—“You are my Lord, and you are my God!”
JHN.20.29	Jesus responded, 
JHN.20.30	Jesus went on to do many more miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not even included in this book. 
JHN.20.31	But all that is recorded here is so that you will fully believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God, and that through your faith in him you will experience eternal life by the power of his name!
JHN.21.1	Later, Jesus appeared once again to a group of his disciples by Lake Galilee. 
JHN.21.2	It happened one day while Peter, Thomas (the Twin), Nathanael (from Cana in Galilee), Jacob, John, and two other disciples were all together. 
JHN.21.3	Peter told them, “I’m going fishing.” And they all replied, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and fished through the night, but caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	Then at dawn, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but the disciples didn’t realize that it was him! 
JHN.21.5	He called out to them, saying, 
JHN.21.5	“Not a thing,” they replied.
JHN.21.6	Jesus shouted to them, 
JHN.21.7	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” When Peter heard him say that, he quickly wrapped his outer garment around him, and because he was athletic, he dove right into the lake to go to Jesus! 
JHN.21.8	The other disciples then brought the boat to shore, dragging their catch of fish. They weren’t far from land, only about a hundred meters. 
JHN.21.9	And when they got to shore, they noticed a charcoal fire with some roasted fish and bread. 
JHN.21.10	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.21.11	So Peter waded into the water and helped pull the net to shore. It was full of many large fish, exactly one hundred and fifty-three, but even with so many fish, the net was not torn.
JHN.21.12	 Jesus said to them.
JHN.21.12	And not one of the disciples needed to ask who it was, because every one of them knew it was the Lord. 
JHN.21.13	Then Jesus came close to them and served them the bread and the fish. 
JHN.21.14	This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
JHN.21.15	After they had breakfast, Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.21.15	Peter answered, “Yes, Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!”
JHN.21.15	 Jesus said.
JHN.21.16	Jesus repeated his question the second time, 
JHN.21.16	Peter answered, “Yes, my Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!”
JHN.21.16	 Jesus said.
JHN.21.17	Then Jesus asked him again, 
JHN.21.17	Peter was saddened by being asked the third time and said, “My Lord, you know everything. You know that I burn with love for you!”
JHN.21.17	Jesus replied, 
JHN.21.19	(Jesus said this to Peter as a prophecy of what kind of death he would die, for the glory of God.) And then he said, 
JHN.21.20	Then Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the disciple who sat close to Jesus at the Last Supper and had asked him, “Lord, who is the one that will betray you?”) 
JHN.21.21	So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “What’s going to happen to him?”
JHN.21.22	Jesus replied, 
JHN.21.23	So the rumor started to circulate among the believers that this disciple wasn’t going to die. But Jesus never said that, he only said, 
JHN.21.24	I, John, am that disciple who has written these things to testify of the truth, and we know that what I’ve documented is accurate. 
JHN.21.25	Jesus did countless things that I haven’t included here. And if every one of his works were written down 
ACT.1.1	To Theophilus, the lover of God.
ACT.1.1	I write to you again, my dear friend, 
ACT.1.2	Just before he ascended into heaven, he left instructions for the apostles he had chosen by the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.1.3	After the sufferings of his cross, Jesus appeared alive 
ACT.1.4	and shared meals with them.
ACT.1.4	Jesus instructed them, 
ACT.1.6	Every time they were gathered together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, is it the time now for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”
ACT.1.7	He answered, 
ACT.1.9	Right after he spoke those words, the disciples saw Jesus lifted into the sky and disappear into a cloud! 
ACT.1.10	As they stared into the sky, watching Jesus ascend, two men in white robes suddenly appeared beside them. 
ACT.1.11	They told the startled disciples, “Galileans, why are you staring up into the sky? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but he will come back the same way that you saw him ascend.”
ACT.1.12	The disciples left the Mount of Olives and returned to Jerusalem, less than a mile away. 
ACT.1.13+ACT.1.14	Arriving there, they went into a large second-floor room 
ACT.1.15	During this time Peter stood up among the 120 believers who were gathered and said, 
ACT.1.16	“Fellow believers, the Scripture David prophesied by the Holy Spirit concerning Judas had to be fulfilled. Judas betrayed our Lord Jesus and led the mob to the garden to arrest him. 
ACT.1.17	He was one of us, and he was chosen to be an apostle just as we were. 
ACT.1.18	He earned the wages of his sin, for he fell headfirst, and his belly split open, spilling his intestines on the ground. 
ACT.1.19	Everyone in Jerusalem knows what happened to him. That’s why the field where he died is called in Aramaic ‘Haqel Dama,’ that is, ‘The Bloody Field.’ 
ACT.1.20	For it is written in the Psalms:
ACT.1.20	‘Let his house be deserted and become a wasteland.
ACT.1.20	No one will live there.’
ACT.1.20	And also:
ACT.1.20	‘Let another take his ministry.’
ACT.1.21	“So then, we must choose his replacement from among those who have been with us from the very beginning, 
ACT.1.22	from John’s baptism until Jesus’ ascension. And, like us, he must be a witness of his resurrection.”
ACT.1.23	They proposed two candidates: Joseph, who is also called Barsabbas the Just, and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	They all prayed, “Lord Yahweh, you know the heart of every man. Please give us clear revelation to know which of these two men you have chosen 
ACT.1.25	to be an apostle and take Judas’ place because he renounced his apostleship to go where he belonged.” 
ACT.1.26	They cast lots and determined that Matthias was the Lord’s choice, so he was added to the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	On the day Pentecost was being fulfilled, all the disciples were gathered in one place. 
ACT.2.2	Suddenly they heard the sound of a violent blast of wind rushing into the house from out of the heavenly realm. The roar of the wind was so overpowering it was all anyone could bear! 
ACT.2.3	 It separated into tongues of fire that engulfed each one of them. 
ACT.2.4	They were all filled and equipped with the Holy Spirit and were inspired to speak in tongues—empowered by the Spirit to speak in languages they had never learned!
ACT.2.5	Now, at that time there were Jewish worshipers who had emigrated from many different lands to live in Jerusalem. 
ACT.2.6	When the people of the city heard the roaring sound, crowds came running to where it was coming from, stunned over what was happening, because each one could hear the disciples speaking in his or her own language. 
ACT.2.7	Bewildered, they said to one another, “Aren’t these all Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	So how is it that we hear them speaking in our own languages? 
ACT.2.9	We are northeastern Iranians, northwestern Iranians, Elamites, and those from Mesopotamia, Judea, east central Turkey, the coastal areas of the Black Sea, Asia, 
ACT.2.10	north central Turkey, southern Turkey, Egypt, Libyans who are neighbors of Cyrene, visitors from all over the Roman Empire, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs. 
ACT.2.11	Yet we hear them speaking of God’s mighty wonders in our own dialects!” 
ACT.2.12	They all stood there, dumbfounded and astonished, saying to one another, “What is this phenomenon?”
ACT.2.13	But others poked fun at them and said, “They’re just drunk on new wine.”
ACT.2.14	Peter stood up with the eleven apostles and shouted to the crowd. “Listen carefully, my fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem. You need to clearly understand what’s happening here. 
ACT.2.15	These people are not drunk like you think they are, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning. 
ACT.2.16	This is 
ACT.2.17	‘This is what I will do in the last days—I will pour out my Spirit on everybody and cause your sons and daughters to prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will experience dreams 
ACT.2.18	The Holy Spirit will come upon all my servants, men and women alike, and they will prophesy. 
ACT.2.19	I will reveal startling signs and wonders in the sky above and mighty miracles on the earth below. Blood and fire and pillars of clouds will appear. 
ACT.2.20	For the sun will be turned dark and the moon blood-red before that great and awesome appearance of the day of the Lord. 
ACT.2.21	But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’ ”
ACT.2.22	Peter continued, “People of Israel, listen to the facts. Jesus, the Victorious, was a Man on a divine mission whose authority was clearly proven. For you know how God performed many powerful miracles, signs, and wonders through him. 
ACT.2.23	This Man’s destiny was prearranged, for God knew that Jesus would be handed over to you to be crucified and that you would execute him on a cross by the hands of lawless men. Yet it was all part of his predetermined plan. 
ACT.2.24	God destroyed the cords of death and raised him up, because it was impossible for death’s power to hold him prisoner. 
ACT.2.25	This is the very thing David prophesied about him:
ACT.2.25	‘I continually see the Lord in front of me.
ACT.2.25	He’s at my right hand, and I am never shaken.
ACT.2.26	No wonder my heart is glad and my glory celebrates!
ACT.2.26	My mouth is filled with his praises,
ACT.2.26	and I have hope that my body will live
ACT.2.27	because you will not leave my soul among the dead,
ACT.2.27	nor will you allow your sacred one to experience decay.
ACT.2.28	For you have revealed to me the pathways to life,
ACT.2.28	and seeing your face fills me with euphoria!’
ACT.2.29	“My fellow Jews, I can tell you there is no doubt that our noted patriarch has both died and been buried in his tomb, which remains to this day. 
ACT.2.30	But as a prophet, he knew God’s faithful promise, made with God’s unbreakable oath, that one of his descendants would take his throne. 
ACT.2.31	So when peering into the future, David prophesied of the Messiah’s resurrection. 
ACT.2.32	“Can’t you see it? God has resurrected Jesus, and we all have seen him!
ACT.2.33	“Then God exalted him to his right hand upon the throne of highest honor. And the Father gave him the authority to send the promised Holy Spirit, which is being poured out upon us today. This is what you’re seeing and hearing!
ACT.2.34	“David wasn’t the one who ascended into heaven, but the one who prophesied:
ACT.2.34	‘The Lord Jehovah said to my Lord,
ACT.2.34	I honor you by enthroning you beside me,
ACT.2.35	until I make your enemies
ACT.2.35	a footstool beneath your feet.’
ACT.2.36	“Now everyone in Israel can know for certain that Jesus, whom you crucified, is the one God has made both Lord and the Messiah.”
ACT.2.37	When they heard this they were crushed and realized what they had done to Jesus. Deeply moved, they said to Peter and the other apostles, “What do we need to do, brothers?”
ACT.2.38	Peter replied, “Repent and return to God, and each one of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to have your sins removed. Then you may take hold of the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.2.39	For God’s promise of the Holy Spirit is for you and your families, for those yet to be born and for everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”
ACT.2.40	Peter preached to them and warned them with these words: “Be rescued from the wayward and perverse culture of this world!”
ACT.2.41	Those who believed the word that day numbered three thousand. They were all baptized and added 
ACT.2.42	Every believer was faithfully devoted to following the teachings of the apostles. Their hearts were mutually linked to one another, sharing communion and coming together regularly for prayer. 
ACT.2.43	A deep sense of holy awe swept over everyone, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. 
ACT.2.44	All the believers were in fellowship as one body, and they shared with one another whatever they had. 
ACT.2.45	 they even sold their assets to distribute the proceeds to those who were in need among them. 
ACT.2.46	Daily they met together in the temple courts and in one another’s homes to celebrate communion. They shared meals together with joyful hearts and tender humility. 
ACT.2.47	They were continually filled with praises to God, enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord kept adding to their number daily those who were coming to life.
ACT.3.1	One afternoon Peter and John went to the temple for the three o’clock prayer. 
ACT.3.2	As they came to the entrance called the Beautiful Gate, they were captured by the sight of a man crippled from birth being carried and placed at the entrance to the temple. He was often brought there to beg for money from those going in to worship. 
ACT.3.3	When he noticed Peter and John going into the temple, he begged them for money.
ACT.3.4	Peter and John, looking straight into the eyes of the crippled man, said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	Expecting a gift, he readily gave them his attention. 
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, “I don’t have money, but I’ll give you this—by the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk!”
ACT.3.7+ACT.3.8	Peter held out his right hand to the crippled man. As he pulled the man to his feet, suddenly power surged into his crippled feet and ankles. The man jumped up, stood 
ACT.3.9	When all the people saw him jumping up and down and heard him glorifying God, 
ACT.3.10	they realized it was the crippled beggar they had passed by in front of the Beautiful Gate. Astonishment swept over the crowd, for they were amazed over what had happened to him.
ACT.3.11	Dumbfounded over what they were witnessing, the crowd ran over to Peter and John, who were standing under the covered walkway called Solomon’s Porch. Standing there also was the healed beggar, clinging to Peter and John.
ACT.3.12	With the crowd surrounding him, Peter said to them all, “People of Israel, listen to me! Why are you so amazed by this healing? Why do you stare at us? We didn’t make this crippled man walk by our own power or authority. 
ACT.3.13	The God of our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
ACT.3.14	You rejected the one who is holy and righteous, and instead begged for a murderer to be released. 
ACT.3.15	You killed the Prince of Life! But God raised him from the dead, and we stand here as witnesses to that fact. 
ACT.3.16	Faith in Jesus’ name has healed this man standing before you. It is the faith that comes through believing in Jesus’ name that has made the crippled man walk right in front of your eyes!
ACT.3.17	“My fellow Jews, I realize that neither you nor your leaders realize the grave mistake you made. 
ACT.3.18	But in spite of what you’ve done, God has fulfilled what he foretold through the prophets long ago about the sufferings of his Anointed One. 
ACT.3.19	And now you must repent and turn back to God so that your sins will be removed, and so that times of refreshing will stream from the Lord’s presence. 
ACT.3.20	And he will send you Jesus, the Messiah, the chosen one for you. 
ACT.3.21	For he must remain in heaven until the restoration of all things has taken place, 
ACT.3.22	For has not Moses told us:
ACT.3.22	‘The Lord your God will raise up
ACT.3.22	a prophet from among you who is like me.
ACT.3.22	Listen to him and follow everything he tells you.
ACT.3.23	Every person who disobeys that prophet
ACT.3.23	will be cut off and completely destroyed.’
ACT.3.24	“In fact, every prophet from the time of Samuel onward has prophesied of these very days! 
ACT.3.25	And you are heirs of their prophecies and of the covenants God made with your fathers when he promised Abraham, ‘Your descendant will bring blessing to all the people on the earth.’
ACT.3.26	“Now that God raised up his Son, he has chosen to send him first to you that he might bless you by turning each one of you from your wickedness.”
ACT.4.1+ACT.4.2	The teaching and preaching of Peter and John angered the priests, the captain of the temple police, and representatives of the Jewish sect of the Sadducees. They were furious that the people were being taught that in Jesus there is a resurrection from the dead. So while Peter and John were still speaking, the Jewish authorities came to the temple courts to oppose them. 
ACT.4.3	They had them arrested, and since it was already evening they kept them in custody until the next day. 
ACT.4.4	Yet there were many in the crowd who believed the message, bringing the total number of men who believed to nearly five thousand!
ACT.4.5	The next day many Jewish leaders, religious scholars, and elders of the people convened a meeting in Jerusalem. 
ACT.4.6	Annas the high priest was there with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest’s family. 
ACT.4.7	They made Peter and John stand in front of the council as they questioned them, saying, “Tell us, by what power and authority have you done these things?”
ACT.4.8	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered, “Respected elders and leaders of the people, listen. 
ACT.4.9	Are we being put on trial today for doing an act of kindness by healing a frail, crippled man? Well then, 
ACT.4.10	you and everyone else in Israel should know that it is by the power of the name of Jesus that the crippled man stands here today completely healed! You crucified Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but God raised him from the dead. 
ACT.4.11	This Jesus is ‘the stone that you, the builders, have rejected, and now he has become the cornerstone!’ 
ACT.4.12	There is no one else who has the power to save us, for there is only one name to whom God has given authority by which we must experience salvation: 
ACT.4.13	The council members were astonished as they witnessed the bold courage of Peter and John, especially when they discovered that they were just ordinary men who had never had religious training. Then they began to understand the effect Jesus had on them simply by spending time with him. 
ACT.4.14	Standing there with them was the healed man, and there was nothing further they could say.
ACT.4.15	So they ordered them to leave the room while they discussed the matter. Among themselves, they said, 
ACT.4.16	“What should we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem can clearly see that they’ve performed a notable sign and wonder—we can’t deny that. 
ACT.4.17	But to keep this propaganda from spreading any further among the people, let’s threaten them severely and warn them to never speak to anyone in this name again.”
ACT.4.18	So they had them brought back in before the council, and they commanded them to never teach the people or speak again using the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John replied, “You can judge for yourselves—is it better to listen to you or to God? 
ACT.4.20	It’s impossible for us to stop speaking about all the things we’ve seen and heard!”
ACT.4.21	Since the members of the council couldn’t come up with a crime they could punish them for, they threatened them once more and let them go. All the people praised God, thrilled over the miraculous healing of the crippled man. 
ACT.4.22	And the man who received this miracle sign of healing was over forty years old.
ACT.4.23	As soon as they were released from custody, Peter and John went to the other believers and explained all that had happened with the high priest and the elders. 
ACT.4.24	When the believers heard their report, they raised their voices in unity and prayed, “Lord Yahweh, you are the Lord of all! You created the universe—the earth, the sky, the sea, and everything that is in them. 
ACT.4.25	And you spoke by the Holy Spirit through your servant David, our forefather, saying:
ACT.4.25	‘How dare the nations plan a rebellion,
ACT.4.25	ranting and raging against the Lord Most High?
ACT.4.25	Their foolish plots are futile!
ACT.4.26	Look at how the kings of the earth take their stand,
ACT.4.26	with the rulers scheming and conspiring together
ACT.4.26	against God and his anointed Messiah!’
ACT.4.27	“In fact, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with Jews and non-Jews, met together to take their stand against your holy servant, Jesus the Messiah. 
ACT.4.28	They did to him all that your purpose and will had determined, according to the destiny you had marked out for him. 
ACT.4.29	So now, Lord, listen to their threats to harm us. Empower us, as your servants, to speak the word of God freely and courageously. 
ACT.4.30	Stretch out your hand of power 
ACT.4.31	At that moment the earth shook beneath them, causing the building they were in to tremble. Each one of them was filled with the Holy Spirit, and they proclaimed the word of God with unrestrained boldness.
ACT.4.32	All the believers were one in mind and heart. Selfishness was not a part of their community, for they shared everything they had with one another. 
ACT.4.33	The apostles gave powerful testimonies about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great measures of grace rested upon them all. 
ACT.4.34+ACT.4.35	Some who owned houses or land sold them and brought the proceeds before the apostles to distribute to those without. Not a single person among them was needy.
ACT.4.36+ACT.4.37	For example, there was a Levite from Cyprus named Joseph, who sold his farmland and placed the proceeds at the feet of the apostles. They nicknamed him Barnabas (or “Encourager”).
ACT.5.1	Now, a man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, likewise sold their farm. 
ACT.5.2	They conspired to secretly keep back for themselves a portion of the proceeds. So when Ananias brought the money to the apostles, it was only a portion of the entire sale. 
ACT.5.3	, so he said to him, “Ananias, why did you let Satan fill your heart and make you think you could lie to the Holy Spirit? You only pretended to give it all, yet you hid back part of the proceeds from the sale of your property to keep for yourselves. 
ACT.5.4	Before you sold it, wasn’t it yours to sell or to keep? And after you sold it, wasn’t the money entirely at your disposal? How could you plot such a thing in your heart? You haven’t lied to people; you’ve lied to God!”
ACT.5.5	The moment Ananias heard those words, he fell over dead. Everyone was terrified when they heard what had happened. 
ACT.5.6	Some young men came in and removed the body and buried him.
ACT.5.7	Three hours later, his wife came into the room, with no clue what had happened to her husband.
ACT.5.8	Peter said to her, “Tell me, were the two of you paid this amount for the sale of your land?”
ACT.5.8	Sapphira said, “Yes, that’s how much it was.”
ACT.5.9	Peter told her, “Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? I hear the footsteps of those who buried your husband at the door—they’re coming here to bury you too!” 
ACT.5.10	At that moment she dropped dead at Peter’s feet.
ACT.5.10	When the young men came in, she was already dead, so they carried her out and buried her next to her husband. 
ACT.5.11	The entire church was seized with a powerful sense of the fear of God, which came over all who heard what had happened.
ACT.5.12	The apostles performed many signs, wonders, and miracles among the people. 
ACT.5.13	And the believers were wonderfully united as they met regularly in the temple courts in the area known as Solomon’s Porch. No one dared harm them, for everyone held them in high regard.
ACT.5.14	Continually more and more people believed in the Lord and were added to their number—great crowds of both men and women. 
ACT.5.15	In fact, when people knew Peter was going to walk by, they carried the sick out to the streets and laid them down on cots and mats, knowing the incredible power emanating from him would overshadow them 
ACT.5.16	Great numbers of people swarmed into Jerusalem from the nearby villages. They brought with them the sick and those troubled by demons—and everyone was healed!
ACT.5.17	The high priest and his officials, who formed the party of the Sadducees, became extremely jealous over all that was happening, 
ACT.5.18	so they had the apostles arrested, placed in chains, and thrown into jail. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night, the Lord sent an angel 
ACT.5.20	“Go,” the angel told them. “Stand in the temple courts and preach the words that bring life!” 
ACT.5.21	So early that morning they entered the temple courts and taught the people. The high priest and his officials, 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came to the prison cell, it was empty! They returned to the council and informed them, 
ACT.5.23	“We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing by their cell, but when we opened the door, there was no one inside!”
ACT.5.24	When the captain of the temple guard and the leading priests heard this report, they were perplexed and at a loss over what to make of it.
ACT.5.25	Someone came and informed them, “The men you put in prison are out there standing in the temple courts, teaching the people!”
ACT.5.26	So the captain of the temple guard and his officers went to arrest them once again, but without using force, for they were afraid the people would stone them.
ACT.5.27	When they brought them before the council, the high priest demanded an explanation, 
ACT.5.28	saying, “Didn’t we strictly warn you that you were to never again teach in this name? But instead you have now filled all of Jerusalem with this doctrine and are committed to holding us responsible for this man’s death!”
ACT.5.29	Peter and the apostles replied, “We must listen to and obey God more than pleasing religious leaders. 
ACT.5.30	You had Jesus arrested and killed by crucifixion, but the God of our forefathers has raised him up. 
ACT.5.31	He’s the one God has exalted and seated at his right hand as our Savior and Champion. He is the provider of grace as the Redeemer of Israel. 
ACT.5.32	We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God freely gives to all who believe in him.”
ACT.5.33	When they heard this, they were infuriated and determined to murder them. 
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a noted religious professor who was highly respected by all, stood up. He gave orders to send the apostles outside. 
ACT.5.35	Then he said to the council, “Men of Israel, you need to be very careful about how you deal with these men. 
ACT.5.36	Some time ago there was a man named Theudas who rose up claiming to be somebody. He had a following of about four hundred men, but when he was killed, all of his followers were scattered, and nothing came of it.
ACT.5.37	“After him, in the days of the census, another man rose up, Judas the Galilean, who got people to follow him in a revolt. He too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	So in this situation, you should just leave these men to themselves. For if this plan or undertaking originates with men, it will fade away and come to nothing. 
ACT.5.39	But if this movement is of God, you won’t be able to stop it. And you might discover that you were fighting God all along!”
ACT.5.39	Gamaliel’s words convinced the council. 
ACT.5.40	So they brought the apostles back in and had them severely beaten. They ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus and then let them go.
ACT.5.41	The apostles left there rejoicing, thrilled that God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus. 
ACT.5.42	And nothing stopped them! They kept preaching every day in the temple courts and went from house to house, preaching the gospel of Jesus, God’s Anointed One!
ACT.6.1	During those days the number of Jesus’ followers kept multiplying greatly. But a complaint was brought against those who spoke Aramaic by the Greek-speaking Jews, who felt their widows were being overlooked during the daily distribution of food.
ACT.6.2	The twelve apostles called a meeting of all the believers and told them, “It is not advantageous for us to be pulled away from the word of God to wait on tables. 
ACT.6.3	We want you to carefully select from among yourselves seven godly men. Make sure they are honorable, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and we will give them the responsibility of this crucial ministry of serving. 
ACT.6.4	That will enable us to give our full attention to prayer and preaching the word of God.”
ACT.6.5	Everyone in the church loved this idea. So they chose seven men. One of them was Stephen, who was known as a man full of faith and overflowing with the Holy Spirit. Along with him they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch, who had converted to Judaism. 
ACT.6.6	All seven stood before the apostles, who laid their hands on them and prayed for them, 
ACT.6.7	God’s word reigned supreme and kept spreading. The number of Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem quickly grew and increased by the day. Even a great number of Jewish priests became believers and were obedient to the faith!
ACT.6.8	Stephen, who was a man full of grace and supernatural power, performed many astonishing signs and wonders and mighty miracles among the people. 
ACT.6.9	This upset some men belonging to a sect who called themselves the Men Set Free. They were Libyans, Egyptians, and Turks.
ACT.6.9	They all confronted Stephen to argue with him. 
ACT.6.10	But the Holy Spirit gave Stephen remarkable wisdom to answer them. His words were prompted by the Holy Spirit, and they could not refute what he said. 
ACT.6.11	So the Men Set Free conspired in secret to find those who would bring false accusations against Stephen and lie about him by saying, “We heard this man speak blasphemy against Moses and God.”
ACT.6.12	The Men Set Free agitated the crowd, the elders, and the religious scholars, then seized Stephen and forcefully took him before the supreme council. 
ACT.6.13	One after another, false witnesses stepped forward and accused Stephen, saying, “This man never stops denigrating our temple and our Jewish law. 
ACT.6.14	For we have heard him teach that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the temple and change the traditions and customs that Moses handed down to us.”
ACT.6.15	Every member of the supreme council focused his gaze on Stephen, for right in front of their eyes, 
ACT.7.1	The high priest asked, “Are these accusations true?”
ACT.7.2	Stephen replied, “My fellow Jews and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was living in Iraq and before he moved to Haran in Syria. 
ACT.7.3	God said to him, ‘Go! Leave behind your country and your relatives. Begin your journey and come to the land that I will show you.’
ACT.7.4	“So Abraham left southeastern Iraq and began his journey. He settled in Haran and stayed there until his father passed away. Then God had him move to the land of Israel with only a promise. 
ACT.7.5	Although God gave him no parcel of land he could call his own, not even a footprint, yet he promised Abraham that he and his descendants would one day have it all. And even though as yet Abraham had no child, 
ACT.7.6	God spoke with him and gave him this promise:
ACT.7.6	‘Your descendants will live in a foreign land with a people
ACT.7.6	who will make slaves of them
ACT.7.6	and oppress them for four hundred years.
ACT.7.7	But I will judge the nation that enslaves them,
ACT.7.7	and your descendants will be set free
ACT.7.7	to return to this land to serve and worship me.’
ACT.7.8	“Then God entered into covenant with Abraham, which included the requirement of circumcision. So when he became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him eight days after his birth.
ACT.7.9	“Isaac then became the father of Jacob, who was the father of our twelve patriarchs. Jacob’s sons became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God’s favor and blessing rested upon Joseph, and in time, 
ACT.7.10	God rescued him from all his oppression and granted him extraordinary favor before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh appointed him as the overseer of his nation and even of his own palace.
ACT.7.11	“Then a devastating famine came over all of Egypt and Canaan, bringing great misery to the people, including our ancestors, who couldn’t find food. 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob learned that there was food in Egypt, he sent his sons, our ancestors, on their first trip to purchase grain for their family. 
ACT.7.13	On their second trip to Egypt, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and because of this, Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family and where he came from.
ACT.7.14	“Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and his entire family, a total of seventy-five people, to come and reside in Egypt. 
ACT.7.15	Eventually, Jacob died there, along with all of his sons, our forefathers. 
ACT.7.16	Their bones were later carried back to the promised land and buried in Shechem, in the tomb Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor.
ACT.7.17	“The time drew near for God to fulfill the prophetic promise he had made to Abraham. Our Jewish people had increased greatly in number, multiplying many times over while in Egypt.
ACT.7.18	“Another king, 
ACT.7.19	He was an abusive king who exploited our people with his smooth talk. With cruelty he forced our ancestors to give up their little boys as he committed infanticide!
ACT.7.20	“Then Moses came on the scene—a child of divine beauty. His parents hid him from Pharaoh as long as they could to spare his life. After three months they could conceal him no longer, 
ACT.7.21	so they had to abandon him to his fate. But God arranged that Pharaoh’s daughter would find him, take him home, and raise him as her own son. 
ACT.7.22	So Moses was fully trained in the royal courts and educated in the highest wisdom Egypt had to offer, until he arose as a powerful prince and an eloquent orator.
ACT.7.23	“When Moses turned forty, his heart was stirred for his people, the Israelites. 
ACT.7.24	One day he saw one of our people being violently mistreated, so he came to his rescue, and with his own hands Moses murdered the abusive Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	Moses hoped that when the people realized how he had rescued one of their own, they would recognize him as their deliverer. How wrong he was! 
ACT.7.26	The next day he came upon two of our people engaged in a fist fight, and he tried to break it up by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers! Why would you want to hurt each other?’
ACT.7.27	“But the perpetrator pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who do you think you are? Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge? 
ACT.7.28	Are you going to kill me like you did the Egyptian yesterday?’
ACT.7.29	“Shaken by this, Moses fled Egypt and lived as an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. 
ACT.7.30	After forty years had passed, while he was in the desert near Mount Sinai, the Messenger of Yahweh appeared to him in the midst of a flaming thorn bush. 
ACT.7.31	Moses was astonished and stunned by what he was seeing, so he drew closer to observe this marvel. Then the Lord Yahweh spoke to him out of the flames:
ACT.7.32	‘I am the living God, the God of your ancestors.
ACT.7.32	I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’
ACT.7.32	“Trembling in God’s presence and overwhelmed with awe, Moses didn’t even dare to look into the fire.
ACT.7.33	“Out of the flames the Lord Yahweh said to him:
ACT.7.33	‘Take the sandals off your feet,
ACT.7.33	for you are standing in the realm of holiness.
ACT.7.34	I have watched and seen how my people
ACT.7.34	have been mistreated in Egypt.
ACT.7.34	I have heard their painful groaning,
ACT.7.34	and now I have come down to set them free.
ACT.7.34	So come to me, Moses,
ACT.7.34	for I am sending you to Egypt to represent me.’
ACT.7.35	“So God sent back to Egypt the man our people rejected and refused to recognize by saying, ‘Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?’ God sent this man back to be their ruler and deliverer, commissioned with the power of the messenger who appeared to him in the flaming thorn bush. 
ACT.7.36	This man brought the people out from their Egyptian bondage with many astonishing wonders and miracle signs—miracles in Egypt, miracles at the Red Sea, and miracles during their forty-year journey through the wilderness. 
ACT.7.37	This is the same Moses who said to our ancestors, ‘The Lord God will raise up one from among you who will be a prophet to you, like I have been. Listen to everything he will say!’
ACT.7.38	“Moses led the congregation in the wilderness and 
ACT.7.39	But our forefathers refused to obey. They pushed him away, and their hearts longed to return to Egypt.
ACT.7.40	“While Moses was on the mountain, our forefathers said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods to lead us, because we don’t know what has become of this Moses who brought us out of Egypt.’
ACT.7.41	“So they made a god, an idol in the form of a bull calf. They offered sacrifices to it and celebrated with delight what their own hands had made.
ACT.7.42	“When God saw what they had done, he turned away from them and handed them over to the worship of the stars of heaven, as recorded in the prophetic writings:
ACT.7.42	‘People of Israel, you failed to worship me
ACT.7.42	when you offered animal sacrifices
ACT.7.42	for forty years in the wilderness.
ACT.7.43	Instead you worshiped the god Moloch,
ACT.7.43	and you carried his tabernacle, not mine.
ACT.7.43	You worshiped your star-god, Rephan.
ACT.7.43	You made idols with your hands
ACT.7.43	and worshiped them instead of me.
ACT.7.43	So now I will cast you into exile beyond Babylon.’
ACT.7.44	“God gave Moses the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle of the testimony. By God’s command, he made it exactly according to the specifications given to him for our ancestors in the wilderness. 
ACT.7.45	The next generation received possession of it, and under Joshua’s leadership they took possession of the land of the nations, which God drove out in front of them. The tabernacle was carried about until 
ACT.7.46	David found loving favor with God and prayed for a dwelling place for the God of Jacob, 
ACT.7.47	but it was Solomon who built him a house.
ACT.7.48	“However, the Most High God does not live in temples made by human hands, as the prophet said:
ACT.7.49	‘Heaven is my throne room and the earth
ACT.7.49	is but a footstool for my feet.
ACT.7.49	How could you possibly build a house
ACT.7.49	that could contain me?’ says the Lord Yahweh.
ACT.7.49	‘And where could you find a place where I could live?
ACT.7.50	Don’t you know that it is my hands
ACT.7.50	that have built my house, 
ACT.7.51	“Why would you be so stubborn as to close your hearts and your ears to me? You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just like your forefathers! 
ACT.7.52	Which prophet was not persecuted and murdered by your ancestors? Name just one! They killed them all—even the ones who prophesied long ago of the coming of the Righteous One! Now you follow in their steps and have become his betrayers and murderers. 
ACT.7.53	You have been given the law by the visitation of angels, but you have not obeyed it.”
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were overtaken with violent rage filling their souls, and they gnashed their teeth at him. 
ACT.7.55	But Stephen, overtaken with great faith, was full of the Holy Spirit. He fixed his gaze into the heavenly realm and saw the glory and splendor of God—and Jesus, who stood up at the right hand of God.
ACT.7.56	“Look!” Stephen said. “I can see the heavens opening and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God 
ACT.7.57	His accusers covered their ears with their hands and screamed at the top of their lungs to drown out his voice. 
ACT.7.58	Then they pounced on him and threw him outside the city walls to stone him. His accusers, one by one, placed their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul of Tarsus.
ACT.7.59	As they hurled stone after stone at him, Stephen prayed, “Our Lord Jesus, accept my spirit into your presence.” 
ACT.7.60	He crumpled to his knees and shouted in a loud voice, “Our Lord, don’t hold this sin against them.” And then he died.
ACT.8.1	Now, Saul agreed to be an accomplice to Stephen’s stoning and participated in his execution. From that day on, a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem began. All the believers scattered into the countryside of Judea and among the Samaritans, except the apostles who remained behind in Jerusalem. 
ACT.8.2	God-fearing men gave Stephen a proper burial and mourned greatly over his death.
ACT.8.3	Then Saul mercilessly persecuted the church of God, going from house to house into the homes of believers to arrest both men and women and drag them off to prison.
ACT.8.4	Although the believers were scattered by persecution, they preached the wonderful news of the word of God wherever they went. 
ACT.8.5	Philip traveled to a Samaritan city and preached to them the wonderful news of the Anointed One. 
ACT.8.6	The crowds were eager to receive Philip’s message and were persuaded by the many miracles and wonders he performed. 
ACT.8.7	Many demon-possessed people were set free and delivered as evil spirits came out of them with loud screams and shrieks, and many who were lame and paralyzed were also healed. 
ACT.8.8	This resulted in an uncontainable joy filling the city!
ACT.8.9	Now, there was a man who lived there who was steeped in sorcery. For some time he had astounded the people of Samaria with his magic, boasting to be someone great. 
ACT.8.10	Everyone, from the least to the greatest among them, was dazzled by his sorcery, saying, “This man is the greatest wizard of all! The divine power of God walks among us!” 
ACT.8.11	For many years everyone was in awe of him because of his astonishing displays of the magic arts.
ACT.8.12	But as Philip preached the wonderful news of God’s kingdom realm, and the name of Jesus the Anointed One, many believed his message and were baptized, both men and women. 
ACT.8.13	Even Simon believed and was baptized! Wherever Philip went, Simon was right by his side, astounded by all the miracles, signs, and enormous displays of power that he witnessed.
ACT.8.14	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God’s message of life, they sent Peter and John 
ACT.8.15	to pray over them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.16	For they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and were yet to have the Holy Spirit fall upon them. 
ACT.8.17	As soon as Peter and John arrived, they laid their hands on the Samaritan believers, one after another, and the Holy Spirit fell and filled each one of them!
ACT.8.18	When Simon saw how the Holy Spirit was released through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he approached them and offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, “I want this power too. I’m willing to pay you for the anointing that you have, so that I also can lay my hands on everyone to receive the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.8.20	Peter rebuked him and said, “Your money will go with you to destruction! How could you even think that you could purchase God’s supernatural gift with money? 
ACT.8.21	You will never have this gift or take part in this ministry, for your heart is not right with God. 
ACT.8.22	Repent this moment for allowing such wickedness to fill you. Plead with the Lord that perhaps he would forgive you the treachery of your heart. 
ACT.8.23	For I discern that jealous envy has poisoned you and binds you as a captive to sin.”
ACT.8.24	Simon begged, “Peter, please pray to God for me. Plead with him so that nothing you just said over me may come to pass!”
ACT.8.25	After Peter and John had testified and taught the word of God in that city, they returned to Jerusalem, stopping at many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the hope of the gospel.
ACT.8.26	Then the Lord’s angel said to Philip, “Now go south from Jerusalem on the desert road to Gaza.” 
ACT.8.27	He left immediately on his assignment.
ACT.8.27	Along the way he encountered an Ethiopian 
ACT.8.28	As he rode along in his chariot, he was reading from the scroll of Isaiah.
ACT.8.29	The Holy Spirit said to Philip, “Go and walk alongside the chariot.”
ACT.8.30	So Philip ran to catch up. As he drew closer he overheard the man reading from the scroll of Isaiah the prophet. Philip asked him, “Sir, do you understand what you’re reading?”
ACT.8.31	The man answered, “How can I possibly make sense of this without someone explaining it to me?” So he invited Philip up into his chariot to sit with him.
ACT.8.32	The portion from Isaiah he was reading was this:
ACT.8.32	He was led away to the slaughter
ACT.8.32	like a lamb to be offered.
ACT.8.32	He was like a lamb that is silent
ACT.8.32	before those who sheared him—
ACT.8.32	he never even opened his mouth.
ACT.8.33	In his lowliness justice was stripped away from him.
ACT.8.33	And who could fully express his struggles?
ACT.8.33	For his life was taken from the earth.
ACT.8.34	The Ethiopian asked Philip, “Please, can you tell me who the prophet is speaking of? Is it himself or another man?”
ACT.8.35	Philip started with this passage and shared with him the wonderful message of Jesus.
ACT.8.36	As they were traveling down the road, the man said, “Look, here’s a pool of water. Why don’t I get baptized right now?”
ACT.8.37	Philip replied, “If you believe with all your heart, I’ll baptize you.”
ACT.8.37	The man answered, “I believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God.”
ACT.8.38	The Ethiopian stopped his chariot, and they went down into the water and Philip baptized him. 
ACT.8.39+ACT.8.40	When they came up out of the water, Philip was suddenly snatched up by the Spirit of the Lord and instantly carried away to the city of Ashdod, where he reappeared, preaching the gospel in that city.
ACT.8.39+ACT.8.40	The man never saw Philip again. He returned to Ethiopia full of great joy. Philip, however, traveled on to all of the towns of that region, bringing them the good news, until he arrived at Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	During those days, Saul, full of angry threats and rage, wanted to murder the disciples of the Lord Jesus. So he went to ask the high priest 
ACT.9.2	and requested a letter of authorization he could take to the Jewish leaders in Damascus, requesting their cooperation in finding and arresting any who were followers of the Way. Saul wanted to capture all of the believers he found, both men and women, and drag them as prisoners back to Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	 and left for Damascus.
ACT.9.3	Just outside the city, a brilliant light flashing from heaven suddenly exploded all around him. 
ACT.9.4	Falling to the ground, he heard a booming voice say to him, 
ACT.9.5+ACT.9.6+ACT.9.7	The men accompanying Saul were stunned and speechless, for they heard a heavenly voice but could see no one.
ACT.9.5+ACT.9.6+ACT.9.7	Saul replied, “Who are you, Lord?”
ACT.9.8	Saul stood to his feet, and even though his eyes were open he could see nothing—he was blind. So the men had to take him by the hand and lead him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	For three days he didn’t eat or drink and couldn’t see a thing.
ACT.9.10	Living in Damascus was a believer named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, calling his name. 
ACT.9.10	“Yes, Lord,” Ananias answered.
ACT.9.11+ACT.9.12	The Lord said, 
ACT.9.13	“But Lord,” Ananias replied, “many have told me about his terrible persecution of those in Jerusalem who are devoted to you. 
ACT.9.14	In fact, the high priest has authorized him to seize and imprison all those in Damascus who call on your name.”
ACT.9.15	The Lord Yahweh answered him, 
ACT.9.17	Ananias left and found the house where Saul was staying. He went inside and laid hands on him, saying, “Saul, my brother, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me to pray for you so that you might see again and be filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.9.18	All at once, the crusty substance that was over Saul’s eyes disappeared and he could see perfectly. Immediately, he got up and was baptized. 
ACT.9.19	After eating a meal, his strength returned.
ACT.9.20	Within the hour he was in the synagogues, preaching about Jesus and proclaiming, “Jesus is the Son of God!” 
ACT.9.21	Those who heard him were astonished, saying among themselves, “Isn’t this the Saul who furiously persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on the name of Jesus? Didn’t he come here with permission from the high priest to drag them off and take them as prisoners?”
ACT.9.22	Saul’s power increased greatly as he became more and more proficient in proving that Jesus was the anointed Messiah. Saul remained there for several days with the disciples, even though it agitated the Jews of Damascus.
ACT.9.23	As time passed, the Jews plotted together to kill Saul, 
ACT.9.24	but it was revealed to him what they were about to do. They closely guarded the gates of the city and tracked his every movement so they could kill him. 
ACT.9.25	But during the night, some of Saul’s converts helped him escape by lowering him down through an opening in the wall, hiding him in a woven basket.
ACT.9.26	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to introduce himself to the fellowship of the believers, but everyone was afraid of him because they doubted he was a true disciple. 
ACT.9.27	Barnabas came to his defense and brought him before the apostles. Saul shared with them his supernatural experience of seeing the Lord, who spoke with him on the road to Damascus. Barnabas also told them how boldly Saul preached throughout the city in Jesus’ mighty name.
ACT.9.28	Then they accepted him as a brother and he remained with them, joining them wherever they went in Jerusalem, boldly preaching in the power and authority of Jesus. 
ACT.9.29	He openly debated with some of the Jews who had adopted the Greek culture, yet they were secretly plotting to murder him. 
ACT.9.30	When the believers discovered their scheme, they smuggled him out of the city and took him to Caesarea and then sent him on to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	After this, the church all over Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a season of peace. The congregations grew larger and larger, with the believers being empowered and encouraged by the Holy Spirit. They worshiped God in wonder and awe, and walked in the fear of the Lord.
ACT.9.32	As Peter was ministering from place to place, he visited God’s devoted ones in the village of Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	He met a man there named Aeneas who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the Anointed One instantly and divinely heals you. Now, get up and make your bed.”
ACT.9.35	All at once he stood to his feet. And when all the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him, they became believers in the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now, there was a follower of Jesus who lived in Joppa. Her Aramaic name, Tabitha, means “gazelle.” She lived her life doing kind things for others and serving the poor. 
ACT.9.37	But then she became very ill and died. After the disciples prepared her body for burial, they laid her in an upstairs room.
ACT.9.38	When the believers heard that Peter was nearby in Lydda, they sent two men with an urgent message for him to come without delay. 
ACT.9.39	So Peter went with them back to Joppa, and upon arriving they led him to the upper room.
ACT.9.39	There were many widows standing next to Peter, weeping. One after another showed him the tunics and other garments that Tabitha had made to bless others. 
ACT.9.40	Peter made them all leave the room. Then he knelt down and prayed. Turning to the dead body, he said, “Tabitha, rise up!”
ACT.9.40	At once she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers and all the widows to come and see that she was alive!
ACT.9.42	The news spread all over the city of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	Peter remained in Joppa for several more days as a guest at the house of Simon the tanner.
ACT.10.1	At that time there was a Roman military officer, Cornelius, who was in charge of one hundred men stationed in Caesarea. He was the captain of the Italian regiment, 
ACT.10.2	a devout man of extraordinary character who worshiped God and prayed regularly, together with all his family. He also had a heart for the poor and gave generously to help them.
ACT.10.3	One afternoon about three o’clock, he had an open vision and saw the angel of God appear right in front of him, calling out his name, “Cornelius!”
ACT.10.4	Startled, he was overcome with fear by the sight of the angel. He asked, “What do you want, Lord?”
ACT.10.4	The angel said, “All of your prayers and your generosity to the poor have ascended before God as an eternal offering. 
ACT.10.5	Now, send some men to Joppa at once. Have them find a man named Simon the Rock, 
ACT.10.6	who is staying as a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
ACT.10.7	After the angel left, Cornelius called for two of his servants and a trusted, godly soldier who was his personal attaché. 
ACT.10.8	He explained to them everything that had just happened and sent them off to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	The next day around noon, as Cornelius’ men were approaching Joppa, Peter went up to the flat roof of the house to pray. 
ACT.10.10	He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while lunch was being prepared he fell into a trance and entered into another realm. 
ACT.10.11	As the heavenly realm opened up, he saw something resembling a large linen tablecloth that descended from above, being let down to the earth by its four corners. 
ACT.10.12	As it floated down he saw that it held many kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and wild birds.
ACT.10.13	A voice said to him, “Peter, go and prepare them to be eaten.”
ACT.10.14	Peter replied, “There’s no way I could do that, Lord, for I’ve never eaten anything forbidden or impure 
ACT.10.15	The voice spoke again. “Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.”
ACT.10.16	The vision was repeated three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.
ACT.10.17	Peter was so stunned by the vision that he couldn’t stop wondering about what all it meant.
ACT.10.17	Meanwhile, Cornelius’ men had learned where Peter was staying and at that same moment were standing outside the gate.
ACT.10.18	They called out to those in the house, “Is this where Simon, the Rock, is staying?”
ACT.10.19+ACT.10.20	As Peter was in deep thought, trying to interpret the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Go downstairs now, for three men are looking for you. Don’t hesitate to go with them, because I have sent them.”
ACT.10.21	Peter went downstairs to the men and said, “I believe I’m the one you’re looking for. What brings you here?”
ACT.10.22	They answered, “We serve Cornelius, a Roman military captain, who sent us to find you. He is a devout man of the highest integrity who worships God and is respected throughout the Jewish community. He was divinely instructed through the appearance of an angel to summon you to his home and to listen to the message that you would bring him.”
ACT.10.23	Peter invited them to stay for the night as his guests. The next morning they departed, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.
ACT.10.24	The next day they arrived in Caesarea, where Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had gathered together all of his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	The moment Peter walked in the door, Cornelius fell at his feet to worship him. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter pulled him to his feet and said, “Stand up, for I’m only a man and no different from you.”
ACT.10.27	They talked together and then went inside, where Peter found a large gathering 
ACT.10.28	Peter said to them, “You all know that it is against the Jewish laws for me to associate with or even visit the home of one who is not a Jew. Yet God has shown me that I should never view anyone as inferior or ritually unclean. 
ACT.10.29	So when you sent for me, I came without objection. Now, may I ask why you sent for me?”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius replied, “Four days ago I was fasting and praying here in my home at this very hour, three o’clock in the afternoon, when a man in glistening clothing suddenly appeared in front of my eyes. 
ACT.10.31	He said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayers. Your generosity to the poor has been recorded and remembered in God’s presence. 
ACT.10.32	However, you must send for a man named Simon, the Rock, who is staying in Joppa as a guest of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I immediately sent my men to bring you here—and you were kind enough to come. And now, here we are, all of us in God’s presence, anxious to hear the message that God has put into your heart to share with us.”
ACT.10.34	Peter said, “Now I know for certain that God doesn’t show favoritism with people 
ACT.10.35	It makes no difference what race of people one belongs to. If they show deep reverence for God, and are committed to doing what’s right, they are acceptable before him. 
ACT.10.36	God sent his word to the Jewish people first, announcing the wonderful news of hope and peace through Jesus, the Anointed One, the Lord of all. 
ACT.10.37	You are well aware of all that began in Galilee and spread throughout the land of Israel immediately after John preached his message of baptism.
ACT.10.38	“Jesus of Nazareth was anointed by God with the Holy Spirit and with great power. He did wonderful things for others and divinely healed all who were under the tyranny of the devil, for God had anointed him. 
ACT.10.39	We apostles were eyewitnesses to all the miracles that he performed throughout the land of Israel. Finally, in Jerusalem, he was crucified on a cross, 
ACT.10.40	but God raised him from the dead three days later, allowing him to be seen openly. 
ACT.10.41	He didn’t appear to everyone, but he appeared to us, his chosen witnesses. He actually ate and drank with us after he rose from the dead!
ACT.10.42	“Jesus ordered us to preach and warn the people that God had appointed him to be the judge of the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	, but all of the prophets agree in their writings that everyone who believes in him receives complete forgiveness of sins through the power of his name.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit cascaded over all those listening to his message. 
ACT.10.45	The Jewish brothers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on people who weren’t Jews, 
ACT.10.46	for they heard them speaking in supernaturally given languages and passionately praising God.
ACT.10.47	Peter said, “How could anyone object to these people being baptized? For they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.” 
ACT.10.48	So he instructed them to be baptized in the power of the name of Jesus, the Anointed One.
ACT.10.48	After their baptism, they asked Peter to stay with them for a few more days.
ACT.11.1	The news traveled fast and soon reached the apostles and the believers living in Judea that non-Jewish people were also receiving God’s 
ACT.11.2	When Peter finally arrived in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers called him to task, saying, 
ACT.11.3	“Why did you stay in the home of people who aren’t Jewish? You even ate your meals with them!”
ACT.11.4	Peter explained what had happened, saying, 
ACT.11.5	“One day when I was in the city of Joppa, while I was praying I fell into an ecstatic trance and I went into another realm. I saw in a vision something like a linen tablecloth descending out of heaven, being let down by its four corners, and it got close to me. 
ACT.11.6	As I examined it I saw many four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds. 
ACT.11.7	Then I heard a voice say to me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat them.’
ACT.11.8	“I said, ‘I can’t do that, Lord! For I’ve never eaten anything that is forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws.’
ACT.11.9	“The voice spoke to me again, saying, ‘Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.’
ACT.11.10	“The vision repeated itself three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	At that moment three men from Caesarea, who had been sent for me, approached the house where I was staying. 
ACT.11.12	The Spirit told me to accompany them with no questions asked. These six brothers here with me made the trip, and we entered into the home of the man who had sent for me. 
ACT.11.13	He shared with us about the angel who appeared to him and told him to send messengers to Joppa to find Simon, the Rock. The angel had told him, 
ACT.11.14	‘He will tell you and your family the message of how you can be saved!’
ACT.11.15	“Shortly after I began to speak, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them, just like what happened to us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	And I remembered the words the Lord had told us: 
ACT.11.17	So I concluded that if God is pleased to give them the same gift of the Holy Spirit that he gave us after they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I to stand in the way of God?”
ACT.11.18	When they heard this, their objections were put to rest and they all glorified God, saying, “Look what God has done! He’s giving the gift of repentance that leads to life to people who aren’t even Jews.”
ACT.11.19	Because of the persecution triggered by Stephen’s death in Jerusalem, many of the believers were scattered. Some reached as far as the coast of Lebanon, the island of Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria, but they were still only preaching the word to Jews. 
ACT.11.20	However, some of the believers from Cyprus and Cyrene, who had come to Antioch in Syria, preached to the non-Jews living there, proclaiming the message of salvation in the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.11.21	The mighty power of the Lord was with them as they ministered, and a large number of people believed and turned their hearts to the Lord.
ACT.11.22	News of what was happening in Antioch reached the church of Jerusalem, so the apostles sent Barnabas to Antioch as their emissary. 
ACT.11.23	When he got there and witnessed for himself God’s marvelous grace, he was enthused and overjoyed. He encouraged the believers to remain faithful and cling to the Lord with passionate hearts. 
ACT.11.24	Barnabas was a good man, full of the Spirit of holiness, and he exuded a life of faith. Because of his ministry even more crowds of people were brought to the Lord!
ACT.11.25	Barnabas left for Tarsus to find Saul and bring him back to Antioch. 
ACT.11.26	Together Saul and Barnabas ministered there for a full year, equipping the growing church and teaching the vast number of new converts. It was in Antioch that the followers of Jesus were first revealed as “anointed ones.”
ACT.11.27	At that time there were prophets in the church of Jerusalem, and some of them came to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them, named Agabus, stood up in one of the meetings and prophesied by the Holy Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over Israel. (This prophecy was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius Caesar.) 
ACT.11.29	So they determined that each believer, according to his or her ability, would give an offering to send as relief to the brothers living in Judea. 
ACT.11.30	They set aside the gifts and entrusted the funds to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem.
ACT.12.1	During this period King Herod incited persecution against the church, causing great harm to the believers. 
ACT.12.2	He even had the apostle Jacob, John’s brother, beheaded. 
ACT.12.3+ACT.12.4	When Herod realized how much this pleased the Jewish leaders, he had Peter arrested and thrown into prison during the Feast of Passover. Sixteen soldiers were assigned to guard him until Herod could bring him to public trial, immediately after the Passover celebrations were over. 
ACT.12.5	The church went into a season of intense intercession, asking God to free him.
ACT.12.6	The night before Herod planned to bring him to trial, he made sure that Peter was securely bound with two chains. Peter was sound asleep between two soldiers, with additional guards stationed outside his cell door, 
ACT.12.7	when all at once an angel of the Lord appeared, filling his prison cell with a brilliant light. The angel struck Peter on the side to awaken him and said, “Hurry up! Let’s go!” Instantly the chains fell off his wrists. 
ACT.12.8	The angel told him, “Get dressed. Put on your sandals, bring your cloak, and follow me.”
ACT.12.9	Peter quickly left the cell and followed the angel, even though he thought it was only a dream or a vision, for it seemed unreal—he couldn’t believe it was really happening! 
ACT.12.10	They walked unseen past the first guard post and then the second before coming to the iron gate that leads to the city—and the gate swung open all by itself right in front of them!
ACT.12.10	They went out into the city and were walking down a narrow street when all of a sudden the angel disappeared. 
ACT.12.11	That’s when Peter realized that he wasn’t having a dream! He said to himself, “This is really happening! The Lord sent his angel to rescue me from the clutches of Herod and from what the Jewish leaders planned to do to me.”
ACT.12.12	When he realized this, he decided to go to the home of Mary and her son John Mark. The house was filled with people praying. 
ACT.12.13	When he knocked on the door to the courtyard, a young servant girl named Rose got up to see who it was. 
ACT.12.14	When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so excited that she forgot to open the door, but ran back inside the house to announce, “Peter is standing outside!”
ACT.12.15	“Are you crazy?” they said to her. But when she kept insisting, they answered, “Well, it must be his angel.”
ACT.12.16	Meanwhile, Peter was still outside, knocking on the door. When they finally opened it, they were shocked to find Peter standing there.
ACT.12.17	He signaled for them to be quiet as he shared with them the miraculous way the Lord brought him out of prison. Before he left he said, “Make sure you let Jacob and all of the other believers know what has happened.”
ACT.12.18	At the first sign of daylight, the prison guards were in a tremendous uproar because of Peter’s disappearance. Herod ordered a thorough search for him, but no one could find him. 
ACT.12.19	After he interrogated the guards, he ordered them executed. Then Herod left the province of Judea for Caesarea and stayed there for a period of time.
ACT.12.20	Now, during those days, Herod was engaged in a violent dispute with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they sent a united delegation to Caesarea to appeal to him and reconcile their differences with the king, for Herod controlled their food supply. First they enlisted the support of his trusted personal assistant, Blastus, who secured them an appointment with the king.
ACT.12.21	On the chosen day, Herod came before them, arrayed in his regal robes. Sitting on his elevated throne, he delivered a stirring public address to the people. 
ACT.12.22	At its conclusion the people gave him a round of applause. The crowd shouted, “These are the words of a god, not a man!”
ACT.12.23	Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness, an infestation of worms, because he accepted the people’s worship and didn’t give the glory to God, and he died. 
ACT.12.24	But the hope of God’s kingdom kept spreading and multiplying everywhere!
ACT.12.25	After Barnabas and Saul 
ACT.13.1	In the church at Antioch there were a number of prophets and teachers of the Word, including Barnabas, Simeon from Niger, Lucius the Libyan, Manean (the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas), and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	While they were worshiping as priests before the Lord in prayer and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “I have called Barnabas and Saul to do an important work for me. Now, release them to go and fulfill it.” 
ACT.13.3	So after they had fasted and prayed, they laid hands on them and sent them off.
ACT.13.4+ACT.13.5	So Saul and Barnabas, 
ACT.13.6	From there they crossed the island as far as Paphos, where they encountered a Jewish false prophet, a sorcerer named Elymas, who also went by the name of “son of Jesus.” 
ACT.13.7	He had gained influence as the spiritual advisor to the regional governor, Sergius Paulus, considered by many to be a wise and intelligent leader. The governor requested a meeting with Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the message of God’s word. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas, whose name means “sorcerer,” stood up against them and tried to prevent the governor from believing their message.
ACT.13.9	Saul, also known as Paul, stared into his eyes and rebuked him. Filled with the Holy Spirit, he said, 
ACT.13.10	“You son of the devil! You are full of every form of fraud and deceit and an enemy of all that is right. When will you stop perverting the truth of God into lies? 
ACT.13.11	At this very moment the hand of God’s judgment comes down upon you and you will be blind—so blind you won’t even be able to see the light of the sun.”
ACT.13.11	As Paul spoke these words, a shadowy mist and darkness came over the sorcerer, leaving him blind and groping about, begging someone to lead him around by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	When the governor witnessed this, he believed and was awestruck by the power of the message of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Paul and his companions sailed from the Cyprus port of Paphos to Perga in southern Turkey. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem 
ACT.13.14	as they journeyed on to the city of Antioch in the region of Pisidia.
ACT.13.14	On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and took their seats. 
ACT.13.15	After the reading from the scrolls of the books of Moses and the prophets, the leader of the meeting sent Paul and Barnabas a message, saying, “Brothers, do you have a word of encouragement to share with us? If so, please feel free to give it.”
ACT.13.16	Paul stood and motioned that he had something to say. He said, “Listen, all of you Jews and non-Jews who worship God. 
ACT.13.17	The God of Israel divinely chose our ancestors to be his people. While they were enslaved in Egypt, he made them great, both in numbers and in strength, until he unveiled his mighty power and led them out of bondage. 
ACT.13.18	For nearly forty years, he nourished them in the wilderness. 
ACT.13.19	He was the one who destroyed the seven nations inhabiting the land of Canaan and afterward gave the land to his people as their inheritance. 
ACT.13.20	This took about four hundred and fifty years.
ACT.13.20	“Then God raised up deliverers for the people until the time of the prophet Samuel. 
ACT.13.21	The people craved for a king, so God gave them one from the tribe of Benjamin: Saul, the son of Kish, who ruled for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	After removing him, God raised up David to be king, for God said of him, ‘I have found in David, son of Jesse, a man who always pursues my heart and will accomplish all that I have destined him to do.’
ACT.13.23	“From David’s lineage God brought Israel a Savior, just as he promised. 
ACT.13.24	So before Jesus appeared, John preached the message of a baptism of repentance to prepare all of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	As John was about to finish his mission, he said repeatedly, ‘If you think that I am the one to come, you’re mistaken. He will come after me, and I don’t even deserve to stoop down and untie his sandals!’
ACT.13.26	“Fellow Jews, Abraham’s descendants, and all those among you who worship and reverence God, this message of life has been sent for us all to hear. 
ACT.13.27	But the people of Jerusalem and their leaders didn’t realize who he was, nor did they understand the prophecies written of him. Yet they fulfilled those very prophecies, which they read week after week in their meetings, by condemning him to death. 
ACT.13.28	Even though they could come up with no legal grounds for the death sentence, they pleaded with Pilate to have him executed. 
ACT.13.29	And they did to him all that was prophesied they would do.
ACT.13.29	“Then they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead! 
ACT.13.31	And for many days afterward he appeared on numerous occasions to his disciples who knew him well and had followed him from Galilee to Jerusalem. Those disciples are now his witnesses, telling the people the truth about him.
ACT.13.32	“So here we are to share with you some wonderful news! The promise God made to our forefathers 
ACT.13.33	has now been fulfilled for us, their children. For God has raised Jesus from the dead, as it says in Psalms:
ACT.13.33	‘Today I reveal you as my Son, and I as your Father.’
ACT.13.34	“God had promised to not let him decay in the tomb or face destruction again, so God raised him from the dead. He gave this promise in the Psalms:
ACT.13.34	‘I will give to you what I gave to David:
ACT.13.34	Faithful mercies that you can trust.’
ACT.13.35	“He explains it further in another Psalm:
ACT.13.35	‘You will not allow your holy one
ACT.13.36	“This cannot be a reference to David, for after he passionately served God’s desires for his generation, he died. He was buried with his ancestors and his body experienced decay. 
ACT.13.37	But the one whom God raised from the dead has never experienced corruption in any form.
ACT.13.38	“So listen, friends! Through this Jesus, the forgiveness of sins is offered to you. 
ACT.13.39	Everyone who believes in him is set free from sin and guilt—something the law of Moses had no power to do. 
ACT.13.40	So be very careful that what the prophets warned about does not happen to you:
ACT.13.41	‘Be amazed and in agony, you scoffers!
ACT.13.41	For in your day I will do something so wonderful
ACT.13.41	that when I perform mighty deeds among you,
ACT.13.41	you won’t even believe that it was I who did it!’ ”
ACT.13.42	As Paul and Barnabas started to leave, the people pleaded with them to share more about these things on the next Sabbath day. 
ACT.13.43	When the meeting had finally broken up, many of those in attendance, both Jews and converts to Judaism, tagged along with Paul and Barnabas, who continued to persuade them to go deeper in their understanding of God’s grace.
ACT.13.44	The following week, nearly everyone in the city gathered to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.45	When the Jewish leaders saw the size of the crowds, vicious jealousy filled their hearts and they rose up to oppose what Paul was teaching. They insulted him and argued with him over everything he said.
ACT.13.46	Yet Paul and Barnabas did not back down. Filled with courage, they boldly replied, “We were compelled to bring God’s message first to you Jews. But seeing you’ve rejected this message and refuse to embrace eternal life, we will focus instead on the nations and offer it to them. 
ACT.13.47	This will fulfill what the Lord has commanded us:
ACT.13.47	‘I have destined you to become
ACT.13.47	a beacon light for the nations
ACT.13.47	and release salvation to the ends of the earth!’ ”
ACT.13.48	When the non-Jewish people in the crowd heard these words, they were thrilled and they honored the word of the Lord. All who believed that they were destined to experience eternal life received the message. 
ACT.13.49	God’s word spread like wildfire throughout the entire region.
ACT.13.50	The Jewish leaders stirred up a violent mob against Paul and Barnabas, including many prominent and wealthy people of the city. They persecuted them and ran them out of town. 
ACT.13.51	As they left, they shook the dust off their feet as a sign of protest against them, and they went on to the city of Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	They left the new converts in Antioch overflowing with the joy of the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	When Paul and Barnabas arrived at Iconium, the same thing happened there. They went, as they always did, to the synagogue and preached to the people with such power that a large crowd of both Jews and non-Jews believed.
ACT.14.2	Some of the Jews refused to believe, and they began to poison the minds of the non-Jews to discredit the believers. 
ACT.14.3	Yet Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time, preaching boldly and fearlessly about the Lord. Many trusted in the Lord, for he backed up his message of grace with miracles, signs, and wonders performed by the apostles.
ACT.14.4	The people of the city were split over the issue. Some sided with the apostles, and others with the Jews 
ACT.14.5	Eventually, all the opposition factions came together, with their leaders devising a plot to harm Paul and Barnabas and stone them to death. 
ACT.14.6	When the apostles learned about this, they escaped to the region of Lyconia, to the cities of Lystra and Derbe and the nearby villages. 
ACT.14.7	And they continued to preach the hope of the gospel.
ACT.14.8	In Lystra, Paul and Barnabas encountered a man who from birth had never walked, for he was crippled in his feet. 
ACT.14.9	He listened carefully to Paul as he preached. All of a sudden, Paul discerned that this man had faith in his heart to be healed. 
ACT.14.10	So he shouted, “You! In the name of our Lord Jesus, stand up on your feet!” The man instantly jumped to his feet, stood for the first time in his life, and walked!
ACT.14.11	When the crowds saw the miracle Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, “The gods have come down to us as men!” 
ACT.14.12	They addressed Barnabas as “Zeus” and Paul as “Hermes,” because he was the spokesman.
ACT.14.13	Now, outside of the city stood the temple of Zeus. The priest of the temple, in order to honor Paul and Barnabas, brought bulls with wreaths of flowers draped on them to the gates of the courtyard where they were staying. The crowds clamored to offer them as sacrifices to the apostles. He even brought flower wreaths as crowns to place on their heads.
ACT.14.14	When the apostles understood what was happening, they were mortified and tore their clothes as a sign of dismay. They rushed into the crowd and shouted, 
ACT.14.15	“People, what are you doing? We’re only weak human beings like everyone else. This is why we’ve come to tell you the good news, so that you would turn away from these worthless 
ACT.14.16	In previous generations he allowed the nations to pursue their own ways, 
ACT.14.17	yet he has never left himself without clear evidence of his goodness. For he blesses us with rain from heaven and seasons of fruitful harvests, and he nourishes us with food to meet our needs. He satisfies our lives, and euphoria fills our hearts.”
ACT.14.18	Even after saying these things, they were barely able to restrain the people from offering sacrifices to them.
ACT.14.19	Some of the Jews who had opposed Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and Iconium arrived and stirred up the crowd against them. They stoned Paul and dragged his body outside the city and left him for dead.
ACT.14.20	When the believers encircled Paul’s body, he miraculously stood up! Paul stood and immediately went back into the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.
ACT.14.21	After preaching the wonderful news of the gospel there and winning a large number of followers to Jesus, they retraced their steps and revisited Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. 
ACT.14.22	At each place they went, they strengthened the lives of the believers and encouraged them to go deeper in their faith. And they taught them, “It is necessary for us to enter into the realm of God’s kingdom, because that’s the only way we will endure our many trials and persecutions.”
ACT.14.23	Paul and Barnabas ordained leaders, known as elders, from among the congregations in every church they visited. After prayer and fasting, they publicly committed them into the care and protection of the Lord of their faith.
ACT.14.24	After passing through different regions of central Turkey, 
ACT.14.25	they went to the city of Perga, preaching the life-giving message of the Lord. Afterward they journeyed down to the coast at Antalya, 
ACT.14.26	and from there they sailed back to Antioch.
ACT.14.26	With their mission complete, they returned to the church where they had originally been sent out as missionaries, for it was in Antioch where they had been handed over to God’s powerful grace. 
ACT.14.27	When they arrived in Antioch, they gathered the church together and shared with them all of the wonderful works God had done through them and how God had opened the door of faith for the non-Jews to enter in. 
ACT.14.28	Afterward, Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time in fellowship with the believers.
ACT.15.1	While Paul and Barnabas were in Antioch, 
ACT.15.2	This sparked a fierce argument between the false teachers and Paul and Barnabas. So the church appointed a delegation of believers, including Paul and Barnabas, to go to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders of the church and resolve this issue. 
ACT.15.3	So the church sent them on their way.
ACT.15.3	As they passed through Lebanon and Samaria, they stopped to share with the believers how God was converting many from among the non-Jewish people. Hearing this report brought great joy to all the churches.
ACT.15.4	When they finally arrived in Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders. They explained to them everything God had done among them. 
ACT.15.5	But some of the believers who were of the religious group called “separated ones” were insistent, saying, “We must continue the custom of circumcision and require that the people keep the law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	So the apostles and elders met privately to discuss the matter further. 
ACT.15.7	After a lengthy debate, Peter rose to his feet and said to them, “Brothers, you know how God has chosen me from the beginning to preach the wonderful news of the gospel to the non-Jewish nations. 
ACT.15.8	God, who knows the hearts of every person, confirmed this when he gave them the Holy Spirit, just like he has given the Spirit to us. 
ACT.15.9	So now, not one thing separates us as Jews and gentiles, for when they believe he makes their hearts pure. 
ACT.15.10	So why on earth would you now 
ACT.15.11	Don’t you believe that we are introduced to eternal life through the grace of our Lord Jesus—the same grace that has brought these people new life?”
ACT.15.12	Everyone became silent and listened carefully as Paul and Barnabas shared with the council at length about the signs and wonders and miracles God had worked through them while ministering to the non-Jewish people.
ACT.15.13	When they had finished, Jacob took the floor and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, listen. 
ACT.15.14	Peter has explained thoroughly that God has determined to win a people for himself from among the non-Jewish nations. 
ACT.15.15	And the prophet’s words are fulfilled:
ACT.15.16	‘After these things I will return to you
ACT.15.16	and raise up the tabernacle of David
ACT.15.16	that has fallen into ruin.
ACT.15.16	I will restore and rebuild what David experienced
ACT.15.17	so that all of humanity will be able to encounter the Lord
ACT.15.18	‘For I have made known my works from eternity!’
ACT.15.19	“So, in my judgment, we should not add any unnecessary burden upon the non-Jewish converts who are turning to God. 
ACT.15.20	We will go to them as apostles and teach them to be set free from offering sacrifices to idols, sexual immorality, and eating anything strangled or with any blood. 
ACT.15.21	For many generations these words of Moses have been proclaimed every Sabbath day in the synagogues.”
ACT.15.22	The apostles and elders and the church of Jerusalem chose delegates to go to Antioch in Syria. They chose Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, both leaders in the church, to accompany Paul and Barnabas. 
ACT.15.23	They sent with them this letter:
ACT.15.23	“Greetings from the apostles and pastors, and from your fellow believers—to our non-Jewish brothers and sisters living in Antioch in Syria and the nearby regions.
ACT.15.24	“We are aware that some have come to you from the church of Jerusalem. These men were not sent by us, but came with false teachings that have brought confusion and division, telling you to keep the law and be circumcised—things we never commanded them to teach. 
ACT.15.25+ACT.15.26+ACT.15.27	So after deliberation, we’re sending you our beloved brothers Paul and Barnabas, who have risked their lives for the glory of the name of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. They are accompanied by Judas and Silas, whom we have unanimously chosen to send as our representatives to you. They will validate all that we’re wanting to share with you.
ACT.15.28	“For it pleases the Holy Spirit and us that we not place any unnecessary burden on you, except for the following restrictions: 
ACT.15.29	Stay away from anything sacrificed to a pagan idol, from eating what is strangled or with any blood, and from any form of sexual immorality. You will be beautiful believers if you keep your souls from these things, and you will be true and faithful to our Lord Jesus. May God bless you!”
ACT.15.30	They sent the four men off for Antioch, and after gathering the regional church together, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	When the people heard the letter read out loud, they were overjoyed and delighted by its encouraging message. 
ACT.15.32	Then Judas and Silas, who were both prophets, spoke to them affirming words that strengthened the believers.
ACT.15.33	After the four men spent some time there, the church sent them off in peace to return to the apostles in Jerusalem. 
ACT.15.34+ACT.15.35	However, only Judas departed; Paul, Barnabas, and Silas stayed in Antioch, where they and many others preached and taught the wonderful message of the word of God.
ACT.15.36	After some days, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s travel to the regions where we’ve preached the word of God and see how the believers are getting along.”
ACT.15.37	Barnabas wished to take Mark (also known as John) along with them, 
ACT.15.38	but Paul disagreed. He didn’t think it was proper to take the one who had deserted them in south-central Turkey, leaving them to do their missionary work without him. 
ACT.15.39	It became a heated argument between them, a disagreement so sharp that they parted from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	And Paul chose Silas as his partner.
ACT.15.40	After the believers prayed for them, asking for the Lord’s favor on their ministry, they left 
ACT.15.41	for Syria and southeast Turkey. Every place they went, they left the church stronger and more encouraged than before.
ACT.16.1	Paul and Silas came to the city of Derbe and then went on to Lystra, the hometown of a believer named Timothy. His mother was a Jewish follower of Jesus, but his father was not a Jew. 
ACT.16.2	Timothy was well known and highly respected among all the believers of Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul 
ACT.16.4	They went out together as missionaries, traveling to different cities where they preached and informed the churches of the decrees of the apostolic council of Jerusalem for the non-Jewish converts to observe. 
ACT.16.5	All the churches were growing daily and were encouraged and strengthened in their faith.
ACT.16.6	The Holy Spirit had forbidden Paul and his partners to preach the word in the southwestern provinces of Turkey, so they ministered throughout the region of central and west-central Turkey. 
ACT.16.7	When they got as far west as the borders of Mysia, they repeatedly attempted to go north into the province of Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to enter. 
ACT.16.8	So instead they went right on through the province of Mysia to the seaport of Troas.
ACT.16.9	While staying there Paul experienced a supernatural, ecstatic vision during the night. A man from Macedonia appeared before him, pleading with him, “You must come across the sea to Macedonia and help us!”
ACT.16.10	After Paul had this vision, we immediately prepared to cross over to Macedonia, convinced that God himself was calling us to go and preach the wonderful news of the gospel to them.
ACT.16.11	From Troas we sailed a straight course to the island of Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis. 
ACT.16.12	Finally we reached Philippi, a major city in the Roman colony of Macedonia, and we remained there for a number of days.
ACT.16.13	When the Sabbath day came, we went outside the gates of the city to the nearby river, for there appeared to be a house of prayer and worship there. Sitting on the riverbank we struck up a conversation with some of the women who had gathered there. 
ACT.16.14	One of them was Lydia, a businesswoman from the city of Thyatira who was a dealer of exquisite purple cloth and a Jewish convert. While Paul shared the good news with her, God opened her heart to receive Paul’s message. 
ACT.16.15	She devoted herself to the Lord, and we baptized her and her entire family. Afterward she urged us to stay in her home, saying, “Since I am now a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” So we were persuaded to stay there.
ACT.16.16	One day, as we were going to the house of prayer, we encountered a young slave girl who had an evil spirit of divination, the spirit of Python. She had earned great profits for her owners by being a fortune-teller.
ACT.16.17	She kept following us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Great High God, and they’re telling us how to be saved!”
ACT.16.18	Day after day she continued to do this, until Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit indwelling her, “I command you in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to come out of her, now!” At that very moment, the spirit came out of her!
ACT.16.19	When her owners realized that their potential of making profit had vanished, they forcefully seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the city square to face the authorities.
ACT.16.20	When they appeared before the Roman soldiers and magistrates, the slave owners leveled accusations against them, saying, “These Jews are troublemakers. They’re throwing our city into confusion. 
ACT.16.21	They’re pushing their Jewish religion down our throats. It’s wrong and unlawful for them to promote these Jewish ways, for we are Romans living in a Roman colony.”
ACT.16.22	A great crowd gathered, and all the people joined in to come against them. The Roman officials ordered that Paul and Silas be stripped of their garments and beaten with rods on their bare backs.
ACT.16.23	After they were severely beaten, they were thrown into prison and the jailer was commanded to guard them securely. 
ACT.16.24	So the jailer placed them in the innermost cell of the prison and had their feet bound and chained.
ACT.16.25	Paul and Silas, undaunted, prayed in the middle of the night and sang songs of praise to God, while all the other prisoners listened to their worship.
ACT.16.26	Suddenly, a great earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. All at once every prison door flung open and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
ACT.16.27	Startled, the jailer awoke and saw every cell door standing open. Assuming that all the prisoners had escaped, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself 
ACT.16.28	when Paul shouted in the darkness, “Stop! Don’t hurt yourself. We’re all still here.”
ACT.16.29	The jailer called for a light. When he saw that they were still in their cells, he rushed in and fell trembling at their feet. 
ACT.16.30	Then he led Paul and Silas outside and asked, “What must I do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	They answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved—you and all your family.” 
ACT.16.32	Then they prophesied the word of the Lord over him and all his family. 
ACT.16.33	Even though the hour was late, he washed their wounds. Then he and all his family were baptized. He took Paul and Silas into his home and set them at his table and fed them. 
ACT.16.34	The jailer and all his family were filled with joy in their newfound faith in God.
ACT.16.35	At daybreak, the magistrates sent officers to the prison with orders to tell the jailer, “Let those two men go.” 
ACT.16.36	The jailer informed Paul and Silas, “The magistrates have sent orders to release you. So you’re free to go now.”
ACT.16.37	But Paul told the officers, “Look, they had us beaten in public, without a fair trial—and we are Roman citizens. Do you think we’re just going to quietly walk away after they threw us in prison and violated all of our rights? Absolutely not! You go back and tell the magistrates that they need to come down here themselves and escort us out!”
ACT.16.38	When the officers went back and reported what Paul and Silas had told them, the magistrates were frightened, especially upon hearing that they had beaten two Roman citizens without due process. 
ACT.16.39	So they went to the prison and apologized to Paul and Silas, begging them repeatedly, saying, “Please leave our city.”
ACT.16.40	So Paul and Silas left the prison and went back to Lydia’s house, where they met with the believers and comforted and encouraged them before departing.
ACT.17.1	After passing through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived at Thessalonica. 
ACT.17.2	As they customarily did, they went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews from the Torah scrolls. For three weeks 
ACT.17.3	Paul challenged them by explaining the truth and proving to them the reality of the gospel—that the Messiah had to suffer and die, then rise again from among the dead. He made it clear to them, saying, “I come to announce to you that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Messiah!”
ACT.17.4	Some of the Jews were convinced that their message was true, so they joined Paul and Silas, along with quite a few prominent women and a large number of Greeks who worshiped God. 
ACT.17.5	But many of the Jews were motivated by bitter jealousy and formed a large mob out of the troublemakers, unsavory characters, and street gangs to incite a riot. They set out to attack Jason’s house, for he had welcomed the apostles into his home. The mob was after Paul and Silas and sought to take them by force and bring them out to the people. 
ACT.17.6	When they couldn’t find them, they took Jason instead, along with some of the brothers 
ACT.17.7	And now Jason and these men have welcomed them as guests. They’re traitors to Caesar, teaching that there is another king named Jesus.”
ACT.17.8	Their angry shouts stirred up the crowds and troubled the city and all its officials. 
ACT.17.9	, they refused to let them go until Jason and his men posted bail.
ACT.17.10	That night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to the city of Berea, where they once again went into the synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	They found that the Jews of Berea were of more noble character and much more open minded than those of Thessalonica. They were hungry to learn and eagerly received the word. Every day they opened the scrolls of Scripture to search and examine them, to verify that what Paul taught them was true. 
ACT.17.12	, along with quite a few influential Greek women and men.
ACT.17.13	When the news reached the Jews in Thessalonica that Paul was now in Berea, preaching the word of God, the troublemakers went there too and they agitated and stirred up the crowds against him. 
ACT.17.14	The fellow believers helped Paul slip away to the coast of the Aegean Sea, while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.
ACT.17.15	Those who accompanied Paul sailed with him as far as Athens. Then Paul sent them back to Berea with instructions for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him.
ACT.17.16	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was deeply troubled when he realized that the entire city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	 with the Jews in their synagogue, and with those who were worshipers of God, and every day he preached in the public square to whomever would listen.
ACT.17.18	Philosophers of the teachings of Epicurus, and others called Stoics, debated with Paul. When they heard him speak about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, “What strange ideas is this babbler trying to present?” Others said, “He’s peddling some kind of foreign religion.” 
ACT.17.19	So they brought him for a public dialogue before the leadership council of Athens, known as the Areopagus.
ACT.17.19	“Tell us,” they said, “about this new teaching that you’re bringing to our city. 
ACT.17.20	You’re presenting strange and astonishing things to our ears, and we want to know what it all means.” 
ACT.17.21	Now, it was the favorite pastime of the Athenians and visitors to Athens to discuss the newest ideas and philosophies.
ACT.17.22	So Paul stood in the middle of the leadership council and said, “Respected leaders of Athens, it is clear to me how extravagant you are in your worship of idols. 
ACT.17.23	For as I walked through your city, I was captivated by the many shrines and objects of your worship. I even found an inscription on one altar that read, ‘To the Unknown God.’ I have come to introduce to you this God whom you worship without even knowing anything about him.
ACT.17.24	“The true God is the Creator of all things. He is the owner and Lord of the heavenly realm and the earthly realm, and he doesn’t live in man-made temples. 
ACT.17.25	He supplies life and breath and all things to every living being. He doesn’t lack a thing that we mortals could supply for him, for he has all things and everything he needs. 
ACT.17.26	From one man, Adam, he made every man and woman and every race of humanity, and he spread us over all the earth. He sets the boundaries of people and nations, determining their appointed times in history. 
ACT.17.27	He has done this so that every person would long for God, feel their way to him, and find him—for he is the God who is easy to discover! 
ACT.17.28	It is through him that we live and function and have our identity; just as your own poets have said, ‘Our lineage comes from him.’
ACT.17.29	“Since our lineage can be traced back to God, how could we even think that the divine image could be compared to something made of gold, silver, or stone, sculpted by man’s artwork and clever imagination?
ACT.17.30	“In the past God tolerated our ignorance of these things, but now the time of deception has passed away. He commands us all to repent and turn to God. 
ACT.17.31	For the appointed day has risen, in which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the Man he has designated. And the proof given to the world that God has chosen this Man is this: he resurrected him from among the dead!”
ACT.17.32	The moment they heard Paul bring up the topic of resurrection, some of them ridiculed him, 
ACT.17.33	So Paul left the meeting. 
ACT.17.34	But there were some who believed the message and joined him from that day forward. Among them were Dionysius, a judge on the leadership council, and a woman named Damaris.
ACT.18.1	When Paul left Athens he traveled to Corinth, 
ACT.18.2	where he met a Jewish man named Aquila, who was originally from northeastern Turkey. He and his wife, Priscilla, had recently emigrated from Italy to Corinth because Emperor Claudius had expelled all the Jews from Rome. 
ACT.18.3	Since Paul and Aquila were both tentmakers by trade, Paul moved in with them and they became business partners.
ACT.18.4	Every Sabbath day Paul spoke openly in the synagogue, to both Jews and non-Jews, attempting to persuade them 
ACT.18.5	When Silas and Timothy finally arrived from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time preaching the word of God, trying to convince the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
ACT.18.6	When they viciously slandered him and hurled abuse on him, he symbolically shook the dust off his clothes in protest against them. He said to them, “Have it your way then! I am guiltless as to your fate, for the blood-guilt of your actions will be on your own heads, and from now on I will preach to the non-Jews.”
ACT.18.7	Leaving the synagogue, Paul went to the home of Titus, a convert to Judaism, for he and his family attended the Jewish meetings 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire family, and many of the Corinthians who heard what had happened believed in the Lord and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	One night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a supernatural vision and said, “Don’t ever be afraid. Speak 
ACT.18.10	because I am with you. No one will be able to hurt you, for there are many in this city whom I call my own.”
ACT.18.11	For the next year and a half, Paul stayed in Corinth, faithfully teaching the word of God.
ACT.18.12	Now, at that time, Gallio was the regional governor who ruled over the Roman province of Achaia, and the Jews turned against Paul and came together to seize him and bring him publicly before the governor’s court. 
ACT.18.13	They accused him before Gallio, saying, “This man is creating a disturbance by persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our laws.”
ACT.18.14	Just as Paul was about to speak in his defense, Gallio interrupted and said, “Wait! If this involved some major crime or fraud, it would be my responsibility to hear the case. 
ACT.18.15	But this is nothing more than a disagreement among yourselves over semantics and personalities and traditions of your own Jewish laws. Go and settle it yourselves! I refuse to be the judge of these issues.” 
ACT.18.16	So Gallio dismissed them from the court.
ACT.18.17	Immediately the crowd turned on Sosthenes, one of the leaders of the synagogue 
ACT.18.18	After remaining in Corinth several more days, Paul finally bid 
ACT.18.19	When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind, then he went into the synagogue and spoke to the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	They asked him to stay longer, but he refused 
ACT.18.21	and said farewell to them, adding, “I will come back to you, if it is God’s will, after I go to Jerusalem to observe the feast.” Then he set sail from Ephesus for Caesarea.
ACT.18.22	When he arrived there he traveled on to Jerusalem to visit the church and pray for them, then he left for Antioch. 
ACT.18.23	After spending some time there, Paul continued on through the region of Galatia and Phyrgia in central Turkey. And wherever he went he encouraged and strengthened the believers.
ACT.18.24	A Jewish man by the name of Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and was recognized as an educated and cultured man. He was powerful in the Scriptures, 
ACT.18.25	had accepted Jesus, and had been taught about the Lord. He was spiritually passionate for Jesus and a convincing teacher, although he only knew about the baptism of John. 
ACT.18.26	He fearlessly preached in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos’ teachings, they met with him privately and revealed to him the ways of God more completely.
ACT.18.27	Then Apollos, with the encouragement of the believers, went to the province of Achaia. He took a letter of recommendation from the brothers of Ephesus so his ministry would be welcomed in the region. He was a tremendous help to the believers and caused them to increase in grace. 
ACT.18.28	Apollos boldly and publicly confronted the Jews, vigorously debating them, proving undeniably from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was ministering in Corinth, Paul traveled on through the regions 
ACT.19.2	The first thing he asked them was “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?”
ACT.19.2	“No,” they replied. “We’ve not even heard of a holy spirit.”
ACT.19.3	Paul asked, “Then what was the meaning of your baptism?”
ACT.19.3	They responded, “It meant that we would follow John’s teaching.”
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John’s baptism was for those who were turning from their sins, and he taught you to believe in and follow the one who was coming after him: Jesus the Anointed One.”
ACT.19.5	When they understood this, they were baptized into the authority of Jesus, the Anointed One. 
ACT.19.6+ACT.19.7	And when Paul laid his hands on each of the twelve, the Holy Spirit manifested and they immediately spoke in tongues and prophesied.
ACT.19.8	For three months Paul taught openly and fearlessly in the synagogue, arguing persuasively for them to enter into God’s kingdom realm. 
ACT.19.9	But some of them hardened their hearts and stubbornly refused to believe. When they spoke evil of the Way in front of the congregation, Paul withdrew from them and took the believers with him.
ACT.19.10	Every day for over two years, he taught them in the lecture hall of Tyrannus, which resulted in everyone living in the province of Asia, Jews and non-Jews, hearing the prophetic word of the Lord.
ACT.19.11	God kept releasing a flow of extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul. 
ACT.19.12	Because of this, people took Paul’s handkerchiefs and articles of clothing, even pieces of cloth that had touched his skin, laying them on the bodies of the sick, and diseases and demons left them and they were healed.
ACT.19.13+ACT.19.14	Now, there were seven itinerant Jewish exorcists, sons of Sceva the high priest, who took it upon themselves to use the name and authority of Jesus over those who were demonized. They would say, “We cast you out in the name of the Jesus that Paul preaches!”
ACT.19.15	One day, when they said those words, the demon in the man replied, “I know about Jesus, and I recognize Paul, but who do you think you are?”
ACT.19.16	Then the demonized man jumped on them and threw them to the ground, beating them mercilessly. He overpowered the seven exorcists until they all ran out of the house naked and badly bruised.
ACT.19.17	All of the people in Ephesus were awestruck, both Jews and non-Jews, when they heard about what had happened. Great fear fell over the entire city, and the authority of the name of Jesus was exalted. 
ACT.19.18	Many believers publicly confessed their sins and disclosed their secrets. 
ACT.19.19	Large numbers of those who had been practicing magic took all of their 
ACT.19.20	The power of God caused the word to spread, and the people were greatly impacted.
ACT.19.21	Paul had it in his heart to go to Jerusalem and, on his way there, to revisit the places in Greece where he had ministered. “After that,” he said, “I have to go to Rome also.” 
ACT.19.22	So he sent ahead into Macedonia two of his ministry assistants, Timothy and Erastus, while he remained in western Turkey.
ACT.19.23	At that time a major disturbance erupted in Ephesus over the people following God’s way. 
ACT.19.24	It began with a wealthy man named Demetrius, who had built a large business and enriched many craftsmen by manufacturing silver shrines for the Greek goddess Artemis.
ACT.19.25+ACT.19.26	Demetrius called a meeting of his employees, along with all the various tradespeople of Ephesus, and said, “You know that our prosperous livelihood is being threatened by this Paul, who is persuading crowds of people 
ACT.19.27	Our businesses are in danger of being discredited. And not only that, but the temple of our great goddess Artemis is being dishonored and seen as worthless. She is the goddess of all of western Turkey and is worshiped in all the world. But if this outrage continues, everyone everywhere will suffer the loss of her magnificent greatness.”
ACT.19.28	When the people heard this, they were filled with boiling rage. They shouted over and over, “Artemis, the great goddess of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.29	The entire city was thrown into chaos as everyone rushed into the stadium together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia.
ACT.19.30	When Paul attempted to go in and speak to the massive crowd, the disciples wouldn’t let him. 
ACT.19.31	Some of the high-ranking governmental officials of the region, because they loved him, sent Paul an urgent message, saying, “Whatever you do, don’t step foot into that stadium!”
ACT.19.32	The frenzied crowd shouted out one thing, and others shouted something else, until they were all in mass confusion, with many not even knowing why they were there!
ACT.19.33	Some of the Jews pushed forward a Jewish man named Alexander to be their spokesman, and different factions of the crowd shouted instructions at him. He stood before the people and motioned for everyone to be quiet so he could be heard. 
ACT.19.34	But when he began to speak, they realized that he was a Jew, so they shouted him down. For nearly two hours they shouted over and over, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”
ACT.19.35	Eventually the mayor of the city was able to quiet them down. He said, “Fellow citizens! Who in the world doesn’t know that we are devoted to the great temple of Artemis and to her image that fell from Zeus out of heaven? 
ACT.19.36	Since no one can deny it, you should all just be quiet. Calm down and don’t do anything hasty. 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men before us who aren’t guilty of any crime. They are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	So if Demetrius and the men of his trade have a case against someone, the courts are open. They can appear before the judge and press charges. 
ACT.19.39	But if you’re looking for anything further to bring up, it must be argued before the court and settled there, not here. 
ACT.19.40	Don’t you realize we’re putting our city in danger of being accused of a riot by the Roman authorities? There’s no good explanation we can give them for all this commotion!”
ACT.19.41	After he had said this, he dispersed the crowds and sent them away.
ACT.20.1	When the uproar finally died down, Paul gathered the believers and encouraged their hearts. He kissed them, said good-bye, and left for Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	At every place he passed through, he brought words of great comfort and encouragement to the believers. Then he went on to Greece 
ACT.20.3	and stayed there for three months.
ACT.20.3	Just as Paul was about to sail for Syria, he learned of a plot against him by the Jews, so he decided to return by going through Macedonia. 
ACT.20.4	Seven men accompanied him as far as western Turkey. They were Sopater, son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus from western Turkey. 
ACT.20.5	These men went ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.
ACT.20.6	As soon as all of the Passover celebrations were over, we sailed from Philippi. After five days we joined the others in Troas, where we stayed another week. 
ACT.20.7	On Sunday we gathered to take communion and to hear Paul preach. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he continued speaking until past midnight. 
ACT.20.8	Many flickering lamps burned in the upstairs chamber where we were meeting. 
ACT.20.9	Sitting in an open window listening was a young man named Eutychus. As Paul’s sermon dragged on, Eutychus became drowsy and fell into a deep slumber. Sound asleep, he fell three stories to his death below.
ACT.20.10	Paul went downstairs, bent over the boy, and embraced him. Taking him in his arms, he said to all the people gathered, “Stop your worrying. He’s come back to life!”
ACT.20.11	Paul went back upstairs, served communion, and ate a meal with them. Then he picked back up where he left off and taught until dawn. 
ACT.20.12	Filled with enormous joy, they took the boy home alive and everyone was encouraged.
ACT.20.13	Continuing our journey, we made our way to the ship and sailed for Assos. Paul had previously arranged to meet us there as he traveled overland by foot. 
ACT.20.14	So he rejoined our team there and we took him aboard and sailed for Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	The next day we crossed over to Chios, and the following day we arrived at the island of Samos. We stayed at Trogyllium, and on the day after that we reached Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	Paul was in a hurry to arrive in Jerusalem, hoping to make it in time for the Feast of Pentecost, so he decided to bypass Ephesus and not spend any time in that region. 
ACT.20.17	However, from Miletus Paul had sent a message to the elders of the church in Ephesus and asked them to come meet with him.
ACT.20.18	When they arrived, he said to them, “All of you know how I’ve lived and conducted myself while I was with you. From the first day I set foot in western Turkey 
ACT.20.19	I’ve operated in God’s miracle power with great humility and served you with many tears. I’ve endured numerous ordeals because of the plots of the Jews. 
ACT.20.20	You know how I’ve taught you in public meetings and in your homes, and that I’ve not held anything back from you that would help you grow. 
ACT.20.21	I urged both Jews and non-Jews to turn from sin to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus. 
ACT.20.22	And now I am captive to the Holy Spirit to go to Jerusalem, without really knowing what will happen to me there. 
ACT.20.23	Yet I know that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town, saying, ‘Chains and afflictions are prepared for you.’
ACT.20.24	“But whether I live or die is not important, for I don’t esteem my life as indispensable. It’s more important for me to fulfill my destiny and to finish the ministry my Lord Jesus has assigned to me, which is to faithfully preach the wonderful news of God’s grace. 
ACT.20.25	I’ve been a part of your lives and shared with you many times the message of God’s kingdom realm. But now I leave you, and you will not see my face again. 
ACT.20.26	If any of you should be lost, I will not be blamed, for my conscience is clean, 
ACT.20.27	because I’ve taught you everything I could about God’s eternal plan and I’ve held nothing back. 
ACT.20.28	So guard your hearts. Be true shepherds over all the flock and feed them well. Remember, it was the Holy Spirit who appointed you to guard and oversee the churches that belong to Jesus, the Anointed One, which he purchased and established by his own blood.
ACT.20.29	“I know that after I leave, imposters who have no loyalty to the flock will come among you like savage wolves. 
ACT.20.30	Even some from among your very own ranks will rise up, twisting the truth to seduce people into following them instead of Jesus. 
ACT.20.31	So be alert and discerning. Remember that for three years, night and day, I’ve never stopped warning each of you, pouring out my heart to you with tears.
ACT.20.32	“And so now, I entrust you into God’s hands and the message of his grace, which is all that you need to become strong. All of God’s blessings are imparted through the message of his grace, which he provides as the spiritual inheritance given to all of his holy ones.
ACT.20.33	“I haven’t been after your money or any of your possessions. 
ACT.20.34	You all know that I’ve worked with my hands to meet my own needs and the needs of those who’ve served with me. 
ACT.20.35	I’ve left you an example of how you should serve and take care of those who are weak. For we must always cherish the words of our Lord Jesus, who taught, 
ACT.20.36	After Paul finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them. 
ACT.20.37	Then they all cried with great weeping as one after another hugged Paul and kissed him. 
ACT.20.38	What broke their hearts the most were his words “You will not see my face again.”
ACT.20.38	Then they tearfully accompanied Paul back to the ship.
ACT.21.1	After we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed a direct course for the island of Kos, and on the next day to the island of Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 
ACT.21.2	There we found a ship that was crossing over to Syria, so we went aboard and sailed away. 
ACT.21.3	After we sighted Cyprus and sailed south of it, we docked at Tyre in Syria, where the ship unloaded its cargo.
ACT.21.4	When we went ashore we found a number of believers and stayed with them for a week. 
ACT.21.5	When it was time for us to leave and be on our way, everyone—men, women, and children—accompanied us out of the city down to the beach. After we all knelt 
ACT.21.6	we kissed one another, said our good-byes, and boarded the ship, while the believers went back to their homes.
ACT.21.7	From Tyre we sailed on to the town of Akko and greeted the believers there with peace. We stayed with them for a day. 
ACT.21.8	Then we went on to Caesarea and stayed for several days in the home of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons and 
ACT.21.9	the father of four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
ACT.21.10	During our stay of several days, Agabus, a prophet from Judea, came to visit us. 
ACT.21.11	, he took Paul’s belt and tied his own hands and feet with it as he prophesied, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘The one who owns this belt will be tied up in this same way by the Jews and they will hand him over to those who are not Jews.’ ”
ACT.21.12	When we heard this, both we and the believers of Caesarea begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	But Paul replied, “Why do you cry and break my heart with your tears? Don’t you know that I’m prepared not only to be imprisoned but to die in Jerusalem for the sake of the wonder of the name of our Lord Jesus?”
ACT.21.14	Because we couldn’t persuade him, we gave up and said nothing more except “May the will of the Lord be done.”
ACT.21.15	Afterward we packed our bags and set off for Jerusalem, 
ACT.21.16	with some of the believers from Caesarea accompanying us. 
ACT.21.17	When we finally arrived in Jerusalem, the believers welcomed us with delight. 
ACT.21.18	The next day Paul and our team had a meeting with Jacob and all the elders of the Jerusalem church. 
ACT.21.19	After greeting everyone, Paul explained in detail what God had accomplished through his ministry among the non-Jewish people.
ACT.21.20	When they heard Paul’s report, they praised God. And they said to him, “You should know, brother, that there are many tens of thousands of Jews who have also embraced the faith and are passionately keeping the law of Moses. 
ACT.21.21	But they’ve heard a rumor that you’ve been instructing the Jews everywhere to abandon Moses by telling them they don’t need to circumcise their children or keep our Jewish customs. 
ACT.21.22	They will certainly hear that you’ve come to Jerusalem. So what is the proper way to proceed? 
ACT.21.23	We urge you to follow our suggestion. We have four men here who have taken a vow and are ready to have their heads shaved. 
ACT.21.24	Now go with them to the temple and sponsor them in their purification ceremony, and pay all their required expenses. Then everyone will know that the rumors they’ve heard are false. They’ll see that you are one who lives according to the law of Moses. 
ACT.21.25	But in reference to the non-Jewish believers, we’ve sent them a letter with our decision, stating that they should avoid eating meat that has been offered to an idol, or eating blood or any animal that has been strangled, and to avoid sexual immorality.”
ACT.21.26	The next day, Paul took the four men to the temple and ceremonially purified himself along with them. He publicly gave notice of the date when their vows would end and when sacrifices would be offered for each of them.
ACT.21.27	When the seven-day period was almost over, a number of Jews from western Turkey who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd against him. Seizing him, 
ACT.21.28	they shouted, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches everywhere what is contrary to our nation, our law, and this temple. And not only that, but now he brings these non-Jewish men with him into the inner courts of our temple! They have made this sacred place ritually unclean.” 
ACT.21.29	(For Trophimus, an Ephesian, had been seen previously with him, and they assumed that he entered the inner courts with Paul.)
ACT.21.30	This ignited a huge riot in the city as all the people came together to seize Paul and drag him out of the temple courts, closing the gates behind him. 
ACT.21.31	But as they were about to kill Paul, the news reached the commander of the Roman garrison that the entire city was in an uproar. 
ACT.21.32	He immediately ran out to the crowd with a large number of his officers and soldiers. When the crowd saw them coming, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	The commander arrested him and ordered that he be bound with two chains. He then asked, “Who is he and what has he done wrong?”
ACT.21.34	Some in the crowd shouted one thing and others something else, just adding to the confusion. Since the commander was unable to get to the truth because of the disturbance, he ordered that Paul be brought back to their headquarters. 
ACT.21.35	When they reached the steps leading up to the fortress, they had to protect Paul and carry him up because of the violent mob following them, 
ACT.21.36	and everyone was screaming out, “Away with this man! Kill him!”
ACT.21.37	As Paul was being led to the entrance of the compound, he said to the commander in Greek, “May I have a word with you?”
ACT.21.37	The commander replied, “So you know Greek, do you? 
ACT.21.38	Aren’t you that Egyptian fanatic who started a rebellion some time ago and led four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?”
ACT.21.39	Paul answered, “I am, in fact, a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a well-known city of southern Turkey where I was born. I beg you, sir, please give me a moment to speak to these people.”
ACT.21.40	When the commander gave his permission, Paul stood on the steps and gestured with his hands for the people to listen. When the crowd quieted down, Paul addressed them in Aramaic and said:
ACT.22.1	“Ladies and gentlemen, fellow believers and elders—please listen to me as I offer my defense.” 
ACT.22.2	(Now, when everyone realized he was speaking to them in their Judean Aramaic language, the crowd became all the more attentive.)
ACT.22.3	Then Paul said, “I am a Jewish man who was born in Tarsus, a city of Turkey. However, I grew up in this city and was properly trained in the Mosaic law and tutored by Rabbi Gamaliel according to our ancestral customs. I’ve been extremely passionate in my desire to please God, just as all of you are today. 
ACT.22.4	I’ve hunted down and killed the followers of this Way. I have seized them and thrown them into prison, both men and women. 
ACT.22.5	All of this can be verified by the high priest and the Supreme Council of Elders. For they even wrote letters to our fellow Jews of Damascus, authorizing me to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“As I was on the road approaching Damascus, about noon, a brilliant heavenly light suddenly appeared, flashing all around me. 
ACT.22.7	As I fell to the ground I heard a voice say, 
ACT.22.8	“I answered, ‘Who are you, my Lord?’
ACT.22.8	“He said to me, 
ACT.22.9	“Those who were with me saw the brilliant light, but they didn’t hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.
ACT.22.10	“So I asked, ‘Lord, what am I to do?’
ACT.22.10	“And the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.11	“Because of the dazzling glory of the light, I couldn’t see—I was left blind. So they had to lead me by the hand the rest of the way into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	“A Jewish man living there named Ananias came to see me. He was a godly man who lived according to the law of Moses and was highly esteemed by the Jewish community. 
ACT.22.13	He stood beside me and said, ‘Saul! My brother, Saul—open your eyes and see again!’ At that very instant I opened my eyes and I could see! 
ACT.22.14	Then he said to me, ‘The God of our ancestors has destined you to know his plan and for you to see the Holy One and to hear his voice. 
ACT.22.15	For you will be his witness to every race of people and will share with them everything that you’ve seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	So now, what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins as you call upon his name.’
ACT.22.17	“Then I returned to Jerusalem. And while I was praying in the temple, I entered another realm 
ACT.22.18	and saw him. He said to me, 
ACT.22.19	“ ‘But Lord,’ I argued, ‘they all know that I’m the one who went into our Jewish meetings to find those who believe in you and had them beaten and imprisoned. 
ACT.22.20	When the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I stood nearby in full approval of what was happening. I even guarded the cloaks of those who 
ACT.22.21	“Then he said to me, 
ACT.22.22	The crowd listened attentively to Paul up to this point. But when they heard this, all at once they erupted with loud shouts, saying, “Get rid of this man! Kill him! He doesn’t deserve to live!”
ACT.22.23	While the crowd was screaming and yelling, removing their outer garments, and throwing handfuls of dust in the air in protest, 
ACT.22.24	the commander had Paul brought back into the compound. He ordered that he be whipped with a lash and interrogated to find out what he said that so infuriated the crowd.
ACT.22.25	When the soldiers stretched Paul out with ropes, he said to the captain, who was standing nearby, “Is it legal for you to torture a Roman citizen like this, without a proper trial?”
ACT.22.26	When the officer heard this, he immediately went to his commander and reported it, saying, “This man is a Roman citizen. What should we do now?”
ACT.22.27	The commander came to Paul and asked him, “Tell me the truth, are you a Roman citizen?”
ACT.22.27	“Yes I am,” he replied.
ACT.22.28	The commander said, “I had to purchase my citizenship with a great sum of money.”
ACT.22.28	Paul replied, “I was born as a citizen!”
ACT.22.29	All of the soldiers who were about to whip Paul backed away, because they were afraid of the consequences for tying up and holding a Roman citizen against his will.
ACT.22.30	The next day the commander ordered that the high priest and the supreme Jewish council be convened, because he wanted to find out exactly why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he had him untied and brought out to stand before them all.
ACT.23.1	Paul fixed his eyes on the members of the council and said, “My brothers, up to this day I have lived my life before God with a perfectly clear conscience.”
ACT.23.2	At that moment, Ananias the high priest ordered those standing near Paul to strike him in the mouth.
ACT.23.3	Paul responded, “God is going to strike you, you corrupt pretender! For you sit there judging me according to the law, yet you broke the law when you ordered me to be struck.”
ACT.23.4	Those standing near Paul said to him, “Do you dare insult the high priest of God?”
ACT.23.5	Paul answered, “I had no idea, brothers, that he was the high priest. For the Scriptures say, ‘Do not curse the ruler of your people.’ ”
ACT.23.6	Just then Paul realized that part of the council were Sadducees, who deny the resurrection of the dead, and others were of the separated ones. So he shouted, “My fellow Jews, I am a separated one, and the son of a separated one. That’s why I’m on trial here. It’s because of the hope I have that the dead will rise to live again.”
ACT.23.7	When he said this, a heated argument started among them, dividing the council between the Sadducees and the separated ones. 
ACT.23.8	 that the Sadducees teach there is no resurrection and do not believe in angels or spirits, but the separated ones believe in them all. 
ACT.23.9	This sparked an even greater uproar among them.
ACT.23.9	Finally, some of the separated ones who were religious scholars stood up and protested strongly, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man. It could be that the Spirit has spoken to him or an angel came to him.”
ACT.23.10	When the shouting match became intense, the commander, fearing they would tear Paul to pieces, intervened and ordered his soldiers to go in to their meeting and seize him and take him back to their headquarters.
ACT.23.11	That night our Lord appeared to Paul and stood before him and said, 
ACT.23.12+ACT.23.13	The next day, more than forty Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath to have no food or water until they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the high priest and the elders to divulge their plans and said to them, “We have united in a solemn oath not to eat or drink until Paul is dead. 
ACT.23.15	So we urge you to have the commander bring him to you as though you were to determine his case with a more thorough inquiry. And we will kill him before he even gets here!”
ACT.23.16	When Paul’s nephew, his sister’s son, overheard their plot to kill him, he came to the headquarters and informed him of their plans. 
ACT.23.17	Paul called for one of the captains and said, “Take this boy to the commander, for he has something important to report to him.”
ACT.23.18	The captain took him to the commander and informed him, “Paul the prisoner asked me to bring this boy to you because he has something important for you to know.”
ACT.23.19	The commander took him by the arm and led him aside in private and asked him, “What do you have to tell me?”
ACT.23.20	He replied, “The Jews have plotted to kill Paul. Tomorrow they will ask you to bring him again to the supreme council under the pretense of wanting to question him further. 
ACT.23.21	Don’t believe them, because they have forty men lying in wait to ambush Paul. These men have sworn an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They’re all waiting for you to agree to their request 
ACT.23.22	The commander dismissed Paul’s nephew after directing him, “Tell no one that you’ve reported these things to me.” 
ACT.23.23+ACT.23.24	Then he summoned two of his captains and said to them, “I want you to take Paul by horseback to Caesarea tonight at nine o’clock. Dispatch two hundred infantrymen, seventy horsemen, and another two hundred spearmen to provide security and deliver him safely to Governor Felix.” 
ACT.23.25	He sent with them a letter that read:
ACT.23.26	From Claudias Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix:
ACT.23.26	Dear Governor,
ACT.23.27	I rescued this man, who was seized by the Jews as they were about to put him to death. I intervened with my troops because I understand that he is a Roman citizen. 
ACT.23.28	I was determined to learn exactly what charge they were accusing him of, so I brought him to stand before the Jewish supreme council. 
ACT.23.29	I discovered that he was being accused with reference to violating controversial issues about their law, but I found no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment. 
ACT.23.30	When I was informed of an imminent plot to kill him, I sent him to you at once, and I have ordered his accusers to also come before you and state their charges against him.
ACT.23.30	Sincerely,
ACT.23.30	Claudius Lysias
ACT.23.31	The soldiers carried out their orders and escorted Paul during the night until they reached the city of Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	The next day the horsemen continued on with Paul and the rest of the soldiers were dismissed to return to their headquarters.
ACT.23.33	Upon their arrival in Caesarea, they presented the letter to the governor and brought Paul before him. 
ACT.23.34	After reading the letter, he asked Paul what province he was from.
ACT.23.34	Paul answered, “Southeast Turkey.”
ACT.23.35	The governor said, “I will give you a full hearing when your accusers arrive here also.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
ACT.24.1	Five days later, Ananias the high priest arrived in Caesarea, accompanied by some Jewish elders and Tertullus, their prosecuting attorney. They were brought before the governor to present formal charges against Paul. 
ACT.24.2	After Paul was summoned, Tertullus accused him, saying, 
ACT.24.3	“Your Excellency Felix, under the shadow of your wise leadership we Jews have experienced a long period of peace. Because of your wise foresight, many reforms are coming to pass in our nation because of you, Most Honorable Felix. We deeply appreciate this and thank you very much.
ACT.24.4	“So that I won’t weary you with a lengthy presentation, I beg you to hear our brief summary, with your customary graciousness. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man to be a contagious plague, a seditious man who continually stirs up riots among the Jews all over the world. He has become a ringleader of the sect known as the Nazarenes. 
ACT.24.6	He has even attempted to desecrate our temple, which is why we had him arrested. We sought to judge him according to our law, 
ACT.24.7	but Commander Lysias came with great force, snatched him away from our hands, and sent him here to you. 
ACT.24.8	He has ordered his accusers to come to you so that you could interrogate him and ascertain for yourself that all these charges we are bringing against him are true.”
ACT.24.9	All the Jews present joined in the verbal attack, saying, “Yes, it’s true!”
ACT.24.10	The governor motioned that it was Paul’s turn to speak, so he began to answer the accusations.
ACT.24.10	“Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly respond in my defense. 
ACT.24.11	You can easily verify that about twelve days ago, I went to Jerusalem to worship. 
ACT.24.12	No one found me arguing with anyone or causing trouble among the people in the synagogues or in the temple or anywhere in the city. 
ACT.24.13	They are completely unable to prove these accusations they make against me.
ACT.24.14	“But I do confess this to you: I worship the God of our Jewish ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. For I believe everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets. 
ACT.24.15	And my hope is in God, the same hope that even my accusers have embraced, the hope of a resurrection from the dead of both the righteous and the unrighteous. 
ACT.24.16	That’s why I seek with all my heart to have a clean conscience toward God and toward others.
ACT.24.17	“After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I returned to bring to my people gifts for the poor. 
ACT.24.18	I was in the temple, ritually purified and presenting my offering to God, when they seized me. I had no noisy crowd around me, and I wasn’t causing trouble or making any kind of disturbance whatsoever. 
ACT.24.19	It was a group of Jews from western Turkey who were being unruly; they are the ones who should be here now to bring their charges if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or at least these men standing before you should clearly state what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the Jewish supreme council, 
ACT.24.21	unless it’s the one thing I passionately spoke out when I stood among them. I am on trial today only because of my belief in the resurrection of the dead.”
ACT.24.22	Felix, who was well acquainted with the facts about the Way, concluded the hearing with these words: “I will decide your case after Commander Lysias arrives.” 
ACT.24.23	He then ordered the captain to keep Paul in protective custody, but to give him a measure of freedom, he allowed any of his friends to visit him and help take care of his needs.
ACT.24.24	Several days later, Felix came back with his wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish. They sent for Paul and listened as he shared with them about faith in Jesus, the Anointed One. 
ACT.24.25	As Paul spoke about true righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified and said, “Leave me for now. I’ll send for you later when it’s more convenient.”
ACT.24.26	He expected to receive a bribe from Paul for his release, so for that reason he would send for Paul from time to time to converse with him.
ACT.24.27	Two years later, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Before he left office he decided to leave Paul in prison as a political favor to the Jews.
ACT.25.1	Three days after Festus assumed his duties in Caesarea, he made the journey to Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.2	Religious authorities and prominent leaders among the Jews brought formal charges against Paul before Festus. 
ACT.25.3	They came asking him for a favor—that he would transfer Paul from Caesarea to Jerusalem—all the while plotting to ambush and kill Paul along the way.
ACT.25.4	Festus responded to their request by informing them that he planned to return to Caesarea shortly. 
ACT.25.5	He told them, “Your leaders can come with me to Caesarea. If this man has broken any laws, you can bring charges against him there.”
ACT.25.6	After Festus had stayed in Jerusalem no more than eight to ten days, he left for Caesarea. The day after he arrived, he convened the court and took his seat on the bench as judge over the proceedings. After he ordered Paul brought into the courtroom, 
ACT.25.7	the Jewish leaders who came from Jerusalem encircled him and leveled against him many serious charges, which they were unable to substantiate.
ACT.25.8	In his defense, Paul said by the Holy Spirit, “I have done nothing wrong. I’ve committed no offense against Jewish law, or against the temple, or against Caesar.”
ACT.25.9	Festus, because he wanted to curry favor with the Jews, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go with me to Jerusalem and be tried for these charges?”
ACT.25.10	Paul replied, “I am standing here before Caesar’s tribunal. This is where I should be tried. As you well know, I have done no harm to the Jews. 
ACT.25.11	If I have committed a crime worthy of death, I won’t seek to escape the death penalty. But if none of their charges are true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
ACT.25.12	After conferring with the members of his council, Festus replied, “Since you have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you will go!”
ACT.25.13	Several days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea for a visit with Festus. 
ACT.25.14	During their stay of many days, Festus explained Paul’s situation to the king to get his opinion on the matter, saying, “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner. 
ACT.25.15	When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and demanded that I issue a guilty verdict against him. 
ACT.25.16	I explained to them that it is not our Roman custom to condemn any man before he has an opportunity to face his accusers and present his defense. 
ACT.25.17	So they returned here with me. I didn’t postpone the trial, but convened the court the very next day and ordered the man to be brought before me. 
ACT.25.18	I listened to their accusations against him, but they were not what I expected to hear, for he had committed no crime. 
ACT.25.19	Rather, their issues centered around disagreements with him over their religion, and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul claimed was alive. 
ACT.25.20	Because I was perplexed about how to proceed, I asked him if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial on these charges. 
ACT.25.21	When Paul appealed his case to the emperor for a decision, I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”
ACT.25.22	King Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to listen to this man myself.”
ACT.25.22	“Tomorrow,” he replied, “you will have that opportunity.”
ACT.25.23	The next day King Agrippa and Bernice entered the audience hall with much pomp and pageantry. Accompanying them were the senior military officers and prominent citizens. Festus ordered that Paul be brought before them all.
ACT.25.24	Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and esteemed guests, here is the man whom the entire Jewish community, both here and in Jerusalem, has asked me to condemn to death. They have screamed and shouted at me, demanding that I end his life. 
ACT.25.25	Yet upon investigation I couldn’t find one thing that he has done to deserve the death penalty. When he appealed to His Majesty the emperor, I determined to send him. 
ACT.25.26	But I have nothing concrete to write to His Majesty, so I have now brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa. After this preliminary hearing I should have something to write, 
ACT.25.27	for it seems absurd to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	King Agrippa said to Paul, “You may now state your case.” Paul motioned with his hand for silence, then began his defense.
ACT.26.2	“King Agrippa, I consider myself highly favored to stand before you today and answer the charges made against me by the Jews. 
ACT.26.3	Because you, more than anyone else, are very familiar with the customs and controversies among the Jewish people, I now ask for your patience as I state my case.
ACT.26.4	“All the Jews know how I have been raised as a young man, living among my own people from the beginning and in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	If my accusers are willing to testify, they must admit that they’ve known me all along as a Pharisee, a member of the most strict and orthodox sect within Judaism. 
ACT.26.6	And now, here I am on trial because I believe in the hope of God’s promises made to our ancestors. 
ACT.26.7	This is the promise the twelve tribes of our people hope to see fulfilled as they sincerely strive to serve God with prayers night and day.
ACT.26.7	“So, Your Highness, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me. 
ACT.26.8	And how should you judge this matter? Why is it that any of you think it unbelievable that God raises the dead? 
ACT.26.9	I used to think that I should do all that was in my power to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	And that’s exactly what I did in Jerusalem, for I not only imprisoned many of the holy believers by the authority of the chief priests, I also cast my vote against them, sentencing them to death. 
ACT.26.11	I punished them often in every Jewish meeting hall and attempted to force them to blaspheme. I boiled with rage against them, hunting them down in distant foreign cities to persecute them.
ACT.26.12	“For that purpose I went to Damascus, with the authority granted to me by the chief priests. 
ACT.26.13	While traveling on the road at noon, Your Highness, I saw a light brighter than the sun flashing from heaven all around me and those who were with me. 
ACT.26.14	We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Aramaic, saying, 
ACT.26.15	“I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
ACT.26.15	“And the Lord replied, 
ACT.26.19	“So you see, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to what was revealed to me from heaven. 
ACT.26.20	For it was in Damascus that I first declared the truth. And then I went to Jerusalem and throughout our nation, and even to other nations, telling people everywhere that they must repent and turn to God and demonstrate it with a changed life. 
ACT.26.21	That’s why the Jews seized me when I was in the temple and tried to murder me.
ACT.26.22	“But in spite of all this, I have experienced the supernatural help of God up to this very moment. So I’m standing here saying the same thing that I’ve shared with everyone, from the least to the greatest. For I teach nothing but what 
ACT.26.23	Moses and the prophets have said was destined to happen: that our Messiah had to suffer and die and be the first to rise from the dead, to release the bright light of truth both to our people and to the non-Jewish nations.”
ACT.26.24	Festus interrupted Paul’s defense, blurting out, “You’re out of your mind! All this great learning of yours is driving you crazy.”
ACT.26.25	Paul replied, “No, Your Excellency Festus, I am not crazy. I speak the words of truth and reason. 
ACT.26.26	King Agrippa, I know I can speak frankly and freely with you, for you understand these matters well, and none of these things have escaped your notice. After all, it’s not like it was a secret! 
ACT.26.27	Don’t you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you do.”
ACT.26.28	Agrippa responded, “In such a short time you are nearly persuading me to become a Christian.”
ACT.26.29	Paul replied, “I pray to God that both you and those here listening to me would one day become the same as I am, except, of course, without these chains.”
ACT.26.30	The king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others got up. 
ACT.26.31	As they were leaving the chamber, they commented to one another, “This man has done nothing that deserves death or even imprisonment.”
ACT.26.32	King Agrippa said to Festus, “If he hadn’t appealed to Caesar, he could have been released.”
ACT.27.1	When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, Festus handed over Paul and a number of other prisoners to the custody of a Roman officer named Julius, a member of the imperial guard. 
ACT.27.2	We went on board a ship from the port of Adramyttium that was planning to stop at various ports along the coast of southwestern Turkey. We put out to sea and were accompanied by Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia.
ACT.27.3	The next day we docked at Sidon, and Julius, being considerate of Paul, allowed him to disembark and be refreshed by his friends living there. 
ACT.27.4	From there we put out to sea, but because the winds were against us, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus. 
ACT.27.5	After sailing across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we docked at the port of Myra in Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	While we were there, the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.
ACT.27.7	We made little headway for several days, and with difficulty we made it to Knidus. The strong winds kept us from holding our course, so from there we sailed along the lee of Crete, opposite Cape Salome. 
ACT.27.8	Hugging the coast, we struggled on to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. 
ACT.27.9	We remained there a long time, until we passed the day of the Jewish fast.
ACT.27.9	Paul advised the frightened sailors that they should not put out to sea in such dangerous weather, saying, 
ACT.27.10	“Men, I can see that our voyage would be disastrous for us and bring great loss, not only to our ship and cargo but also to our own lives. 
ACT.27.11	But the officer in charge was persuaded more by the ship’s helmsman and captain than he was by Paul. 
ACT.27.12	So the majority decided to put out to sea, since Fair Haven was an exposed harbor and not suitable to winter in. They had hoped to somehow reach the Cretan port of Phineka, which was a more suitable port because it was facing south.
ACT.27.13	When a gentle south breeze began to blow, they assumed they could make it, so they pulled up anchor and sailed close to Crete. 
ACT.27.14	But it wasn’t long before the weather abruptly worsened and a storm of hurricane force called the Nor’easter tore across the island and blew us out to sea. 
ACT.27.15	The sailors weren’t able to turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it be driven by the gale winds.
ACT.27.16	As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to get the ship’s lifeboat under control, 
ACT.27.17	so the crew hoisted the dinghy aboard. The sailors used ropes and cables to undergird the ship, fearing they would run aground on the shoals of Syrtis. They lowered the drag anchor to slow its speed and let the ship be driven along.
ACT.27.18	The next day, because of being battered severely by the storm, the sailors jettisoned the cargo, 
ACT.27.19	and by the third day they even threw the ship’s tackle and rigging overboard. 
ACT.27.20	After many days of seeing neither the sun nor the stars, and with the violent storm continuing to rage against us, all hope of ever getting through it alive was abandoned.
ACT.27.21	After being without food for a long time, Paul stepped before them all and said, “Men, you should have obeyed me and avoided all of this pain and suffering by not leaving Crete. 
ACT.27.22	Now listen to me. Don’t be depressed, for no one will perish—only the ship will be lost. 
ACT.27.23	For God’s angel visited me last night, the angel of my God, the God I passionately serve. He came and stood in front of me 
ACT.27.24	and said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul. You are destined to stand trial before Caesar. And because of God’s favor on you, he has given you the lives of everyone who is sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So men, keep up your courage! I know that God will protect you, just as he told me he would. 
ACT.27.26	But we must run aground on some island 
ACT.27.27	On the fourteenth night of being tossed about the Adriatic Sea, about midnight, the sailors sensed we were approaching land. 
ACT.27.28	So they took soundings and discovered that the water was about 120 feet deep. After sailing a short distance, they again took soundings and found it was only ninety feet deep. 
ACT.27.29	Fearing we would be dashed against a rocky coast, they dropped four anchors from the stern and waited for morning to come.
ACT.27.30	Some sailors pretended to go down to drop anchors from the bow when in fact they wanted to lower the lifeboat into the sea and escape, abandoning ship. 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the Roman officer and his soldiers, “Unless you all stay together onboard the ship, you have no chance of surviving.” 
ACT.27.32	At the moment they heard this, the soldiers cut the ropes of the dinghy and let it fall away.
ACT.27.33	Just before daybreak, Paul urged everyone to eat. He said, “Today makes two full weeks that you’ve been in fearful peril and hunger, unable to eat a thing. 
ACT.27.34	Now eat and be nourished. For you’ll all come through this ordeal without a scratch.”
ACT.27.35	Then Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them, broke it and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36+ACT.27.37	There were 276 people who ate until they were filled, and were strengthened and encouraged. 
ACT.27.38	After they were satisfied, they threw the grain into the sea to lighten the ship.
ACT.27.39	When daylight came, the sailors didn’t recognize the land, but they noticed a cove with a sandy beach, so they decided to run the ship ashore. 
ACT.27.40	They cut away the anchors, leaving them in the sea, untied the ropes holding the rudders, and hoisted the foresail to the breeze to head for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But they drifted into the rocky shoals between two depths of the sea, causing the ship to flounder still a distance from shore. The bow was stuck fast, jammed on the rocks, while the stern was being smashed by the pounding of the surf.
ACT.27.42	The soldiers wanted to kill all the prisoners to prevent them from escaping. 
ACT.27.43	But the Roman officer was determined to bring Paul safely through, so he foiled their attempts. He commanded the prisoners and crew who could swim to jump overboard and swim ashore. 
ACT.27.44	The rest all managed to survive by clinging to planks and broken pieces of the ship, so that everyone scrambled to the shore uninjured.
ACT.28.1	After we had safely reached land, we discovered that the island we were on was Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The people who lived there showed us extraordinary kindness, for they welcomed us around the fire they had built because it was cold and rainy.
ACT.28.3	When Paul had gathered an armful of brushwood and was setting it on the fire, a venomous snake was driven out by the heat and latched onto Paul’s hand with its fangs. 
ACT.28.4	When the islanders saw the snake dangling from Paul’s hand, they said to one another, “No doubt about it, this guy is a murderer. Even though he escaped death at sea, Justice has now caught up with him!”
ACT.28.5	But Paul shook the snake off, flung it into the fire, and suffered no harm at all. 
ACT.28.6	Everyone watched him, expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. After observing him for a long time and seeing that nothing unusual happened, they changed their minds and said, “He must be a god!”
ACT.28.7	The Roman governor of the island, named Publius, had his estate nearby. He graciously welcomed us as his houseguests and showed us hospitality for the three days that we stayed with him. 
ACT.28.8	His father lay sick in bed, suffering from fits of high fever and dysentery. So Paul went into his room, and after praying, placed his hands on him. He was instantly healed. 
ACT.28.9	When the people of the island heard about this miracle, they brought all the sick to Paul, and they were also healed. 
ACT.28.10	The islanders honored us greatly, and when we were preparing to set sail again, they gave us all the supplies we needed for our journey.
ACT.28.11	After three months we put out to sea on an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island. The ship had carved on its prow as its emblem the “Heavenly Twins.”
ACT.28.12	When we landed at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we set sail for the Italian city of Rhegium. The day after we landed, a south wind sprang up that enabled us to reach Puteoli in two days. 
ACT.28.14	There we found some believers, who begged us to stay with them for a week. Afterward, we made our way to Rome.
ACT.28.15	When the believers were alerted we were coming, they came out to meet us at the Forum of Appius 
ACT.28.16	When we finally entered Rome, Paul was turned over to the authorities and was allowed to live where he pleased, with one soldier assigned to guard him.
ACT.28.17	After three days Paul called together all the prominent members of the Jewish community of Rome. When they had all assembled, Paul said to them, “My fellow Jews, while I was in Jerusalem, I was handed over as a prisoner of the Romans for prosecution, even though I had done nothing against any of our people or our Jewish customs. 
ACT.28.18	After hearing my case, the Roman authorities wanted to release me since they found nothing that deserved a death sentence. 
ACT.28.19	When the Jews objected to this, I felt it necessary, with no malice against them, to appeal to Caesar. 
ACT.28.20	This, then, is the reason I’ve asked to speak with you, so that I could explain these things. It is only because I believe in the Hope of Israel that I am in chains before you.”
ACT.28.21	They replied, “We haven’t received any letters from the Jews of Judea, nor has anyone come to us with a bad report about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we are anxious to hear you present your views regarding this Christian sect we’ve been hearing about, for people everywhere are speaking against it.”
ACT.28.23	So they set a time to meet with Paul. On that day an even greater crowd gathered where he was staying. From morning until evening Paul taught them, opening up the truths of God’s kingdom realm. With convincing arguments from both the Law and the Prophets, he tried to persuade them about Jesus. 
ACT.28.24	Some were converted, but others refused to believe. They argued back and forth, 
ACT.28.25	still unable to agree among themselves. They were about to leave when Paul made one last statement to them: “The Holy Spirit stated it well when he spoke to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah:
ACT.28.26	‘I send you to this people to say to them, “You will keep learning, but not understanding. You will keep staring at truth but not perceiving it. 
ACT.28.27	For your hearts are hard and insensitive to me—you must be hard of hearing! For you’ve closed your eyes so that you won’t be troubled by the truth, and you’ve covered your ears so that you won’t have to listen and be pierced by what I say. For then you would have to respond and repent, so that I could heal your hearts.” ’
ACT.28.28	“So listen well. This wonderful salvation given by God is now being presented to the non-Jewish nations, and they will believe and receive it!”
ACT.28.30	Paul lived two more years in Rome, in his own rented quarters, welcoming all who came to visit. 
ACT.28.31	He continued to proclaim to all the truths of God’s kingdom realm, teaching them about the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, speaking triumphantly and without any restriction.
ROM.1.1	Paul, a loving and loyal servant of the Anointed One, Jesus. He called me to be his apostle and set me apart with a mission to reveal God’s wonderful gospel. 
ROM.1.7	I write this letter to all his beloved chosen ones in Rome, for you have been divinely summoned to be holy. May his joyous grace and total well-being, flowing from our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, rest upon you.
ROM.1.2	My commission is to preach the good news. Yet it is not entirely new, but the fulfillment of the hope promised to us through the many prophecies found in the sacred Scriptures. 
ROM.1.3	For the gospel is all about God’s Son. As a man he descended from David’s royal lineage, 
ROM.1.4	but as the mighty Son of God he was raised from the dead and miraculously set apart with a display of triumphant power supplied by the Spirit of Holiness. And now Jesus is our Lord and our Messiah. 
ROM.1.5	Through him a joy-producing grace cascaded into us, empowering us with the gift of apostleship, so that we can win people from every nation into a faithful commitment to Jesus, to bring honor to his name. 
ROM.1.6	And you are among the chosen ones who received the call to belong to Jesus, the Anointed One.
ROM.1.8	I give thanks to God for all of you, because the testimony of your 
ROM.1.9	And God knows that I pray for you continually and at all times. For I 
ROM.1.10	My desire and constant prayer is that I would succeed in coming to you, according to the plan and timing of God. 
ROM.1.11	I yearn to come and be face-to-face with you and get to know you. For I long to impart to you some spiritual gift that will empower you to stand strong in your faith. 
ROM.1.12	Now, this means that when we come together and are side by side, something wonderful will be released. We can expect to be co-encouraged and co-comforted by each other’s faith!
ROM.1.13	So, my dear brothers and sisters, please don’t interpret my failure to visit you as indifference, because many times I’ve intended to come but have not been released to do so up to now. For I long to enjoy a harvest of spiritual fruit among you, like I have experienced among the nations. 
ROM.1.14	Love obligates me to preach to everyone, to those who are among the elite and those who are among the outcasts, to those who are wise and educated as well as to those who are foolish and unlearned. 
ROM.1.15	This is why I am so excited about coming to preach the wonderful message of Jesus to you in Rome!
ROM.1.16	I refuse to be ashamed of sharing the wonderful message of God’s liberating power unleashed in us through Christ! For I am thrilled to preach that everyone who believes is saved—the Jew first, and then people everywhere! 
ROM.1.17	This gospel unveils a continual revelation of God’s righteousness—a perfect righteousness given to us when we believe. And it moves us from 
ROM.1.17	“We are right with God through life-giving faith!”
ROM.1.18	For God in heaven unveils his holy anger breaking forth against every form of sin, both toward ungodliness that lives in hearts and evil actions. For the wickedness of humanity deliberately smothers the truth and keeps people from acknowledging the truth about God. 
ROM.1.19	In reality, the truth of God is known instinctively, for God has embedded this knowledge inside every human heart. 
ROM.1.20	, because from the creation of the world, the invisible qualities of God’s nature have been made visible, such as his eternal power and transcendence. He has made his wonderful attributes easily perceived, for seeing the visible makes us understand the invisible. So then, this leaves everyone without excuse.
ROM.1.21	 the fingerprints of God were upon them, yet they refused to honor him as God or even be thankful for his kindness. Instead, they entertained corrupt and foolish thoughts about what God was like. This left them with nothing but misguided hearts, steeped in moral darkness. 
ROM.1.22	Although claiming to be wise, they were in fact shallow fools. 
ROM.1.23	For only a fool would trade the unfading splendor of the immortal God to worship the fading image of other humans, idols made to look like people, animals, birds, and even creeping reptiles!
ROM.1.24	This is why God lifted off his restraining hand and let them have full expression of their sinful and shameful desires. They were given over to moral depravity, dishonoring their bodies 
ROM.1.25	all because they traded the truth of God for a lie. They worshiped and served the things God made rather than the God who made all things—glory and praises to him forever and ever! Amen!
ROM.1.26+ROM.1.27	For this reason God gave them over to their own disgraceful and vile passions. Enflamed with lust for one another, men and women ignored the natural order and exchanged normal sexual relations for homosexuality. Women engaged in lesbian conduct, and men committed shameful acts with men, receiving in themselves the due penalty for their deviation.
ROM.1.28	And because they thought it was worthless to embrace the true knowledge of God, God gave them over to a worthless mind-set, to break all rules of proper conduct. 
ROM.1.29	Their sinful lives became full of every kind of evil, wicked schemes, greed, and cruelty. Their hearts overflowed with jealous cravings, and with conflict and strife, which drove them into hateful arguments and murder. They are deceitful liars full of hostility. They are gossips 
ROM.1.30	who love to spread malicious slander. With inflated egos they hurl hateful insults at God, yet they are nothing more than arrogant boasters. They are rebels against their parents and totally immoral. 
ROM.1.31	They are senseless, faithless, ruthless, heartless, and completely merciless. 
ROM.1.32	Although they are fully aware of God’s laws and proper order, and knowing that those who do all of these things deserve to die, yet they still go headlong into darkness, encouraging others to do the same and applauding them when they do!
ROM.2.1	No matter who you are, before you judge the wickedness of others, you had better remember this: you are also without excuse, for you too are guilty of the same kind of things! When you judge others, and then do the same things they do, you condemn yourself. 
ROM.2.2	We know that God’s judgment falls upon those who practice these things. God is always right, because he has all the facts. 
ROM.2.3	And no matter who you think you are, when you judge others who do these things and then do the same things yourself, what makes you think that you will escape God’s judgment?
ROM.2.4	Do the riches of his extraordinary kindness make you take him for granted and despise him? Haven’t you experienced how kind and understanding he has been to you? Don’t mistake his tolerance for acceptance. Do you realize that all the wealth of his extravagant kindness is meant to melt your heart and lead you into repentance? 
ROM.2.5	But because of your calloused heart and refusal to change direction, you are piling up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.
ROM.2.6	For:
ROM.2.6	He will give to each one in return for what he has done.
ROM.2.7	For those living in constant goodness and doing what pleases him, seeking an unfading glory and honor and imperishable virtue, will experience eternal life. 
ROM.2.8	But those governed by selfishness and self-promotion, whose hearts are unresponsive to God’s truth and would rather embrace unrighteousness, will experience the fullness of wrath.
ROM.2.9	Anyone who does evil can expect tribulation and distress—to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew. 
ROM.2.10	But when we do what pleases God, we can expect unfading glory, true honor, and a continual peace—to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew, 
ROM.2.11	for God sees us all without partiality.
ROM.2.12	When people who have never been exposed to the laws of Moses commit sin, they will still perish for what they do. And those who are under the law of Moses and fail to obey it are condemned by the law. 
ROM.2.13	For it’s not merely knowing the law that makes you right with God, but doing all that the law says that will cause God to pronounce you innocent.
ROM.2.14	For example, whenever people who don’t possess the law as their birthright commit sin, it still confirms that a “law” is present in their conscience. For when they instinctively do what the law requires, that becomes a “law” to govern them, even though they don’t have Mosaic law. 
ROM.2.15	It demonstrates that the requirements of the law are woven into their hearts. They know what is right and wrong, for their conscience validates this “law” in their heart. Their thoughts correct them in one instance and commend them in another. 
ROM.2.16	So this judgment will be revealed on the day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, judges the hidden secrets of people’s hearts. And their response to the gospel I preach will be the standard of judgment used in that day.
ROM.2.17	Now, you claim to be a Jew because you lean upon your trust in the law and boast in your relationship with God. 
ROM.2.18	And you claim to know the will of God, and to have the moral high ground because you’ve been taught the law of Moses. 
ROM.2.19	You are also confident that you are a qualified guide to those who are “blind,” a shining light to those who live in darkness. 
ROM.2.20	You are confident that you are a true teacher of the foolish and immature, all because you have the treasury of truth and knowledge in the law of Moses. 
ROM.2.21	So let me ask you this: Why don’t you practice what you preach? You preach, “Don’t steal!” but are you a thief? 
ROM.2.22	You are swift to tell others, “Don’t commit adultery!” but are you guilty of adultery? You say, “I hate idolatry and false gods!” but do you withhold from the true God what is due him? 
ROM.2.23	Even though you boast in the law, you dishonor God, the Lawgiver, when you break it! 
ROM.2.24	For your actions seem to fulfill what is written:
ROM.2.24	“God’s precious name is cursed among the nations because of you.”
ROM.2.25	, yet circumcision only has value if you faithfully keep the teachings of the law. But if you violate the law, you have invalidated your circumcision. 
ROM.2.26	And if the uncircumcised one faithfully keeps the law, won’t his obedience make him more “Jewish” than the actual rite of circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	And won’t the one who has never had the knife cut his foreskin be your judge when you break the law? 
ROM.2.28	You are not a Jew if it’s only superficial—for it’s more than the surgical cut of a knife that makes you Jewish. 
ROM.2.29	But you are Jewish because of the inward act of spiritual circumcision—a radical change that lays bare your heart. It’s not by the principle of law, but by power of the Holy Spirit. For then your praise will not come from people, but from God himself!
ROM.3.1	So then what is the importance of circumcision, and what advantage is there of being a Jew? 
ROM.3.2	Actually, there are numerous advantages. Most important, God 
ROM.3.3	But what if some were unfaithful to their divine calling? Does their unbelief weaken God’s faithfulness? 
ROM.3.4	Absolutely not! God will always be proven faithful and true to his word, while people are proven to be liars. This will fulfill what was written in the Scriptures:
ROM.3.4	Your words will always be vindicated
ROM.3.4	and you will rise victorious
ROM.3.4	when you are being tried by your critics!
ROM.3.5	But what if our wrong shows how right God is? Doesn’t our bad serve the purpose of making God look good? (Of course, I’m only speaking from a human viewpoint.) Would that infer that God is unfair when he displays his anger against wrongdoing? 
ROM.3.6	Absolutely not! For if that were the case, how could God be the righteous judge of all the earth?
ROM.3.7	So, if my lie brings into sharp contrast the brightness of God’s truth, and if my lie accentuates his glory, then why should I be condemned as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	Is it proper for us to sin, just so good things may come? May it never be! Yet there are some who slander us and claim that is what we teach. They deserve to be condemned for even saying it!
ROM.3.9	So, are we to conclude then that we Jews are superior to all others? Certainly not! For we have already proven that both Jews and gentiles are all under the bondage of sin. 
ROM.3.10	And the Scriptures agree, for it is written:
ROM.3.10	There is no one who always does what is right,
ROM.3.10	no, not even one!
ROM.3.11	There is no one with true spiritual insight,
ROM.3.11	and there is no one who seeks after God alone.
ROM.3.12	All have deliberately wandered from God’s ways.
ROM.3.12	All have become depraved and unfit.
ROM.3.12	Kindness has disappeared from them all,
ROM.3.12	not even one is good.
ROM.3.13	Their words release a stench,
ROM.3.13	like the smell of death—foul and filthy!
ROM.3.13	Deceitful lies roll off their tongues.
ROM.3.13	The venom of a viper drips from their lips.
ROM.3.14	Bitter profanity flows from their mouths,
ROM.3.14	only meant to cut and harm.
ROM.3.15	They are infatuated with violence and murder.
ROM.3.16	They release ruin and misery wherever they go.
ROM.3.17	They never experience the path of peace.
ROM.3.18	They shut their eyes to the awe-inspiring God!
ROM.3.19	Now, we realize that everything the law says is addressed to those who are under its authority. This is for two reasons: So that every excuse will be silenced, 
ROM.3.20	For by the merit of observing the law no one earns the status of being declared righteous before God, for it is the law that fully exposes and unmasks the reality of sin.
ROM.3.21+ROM.3.22	But now, independently of the law, the righteousness of God is tangible and brought to light through Jesus, the Anointed One. This is the righteousness that the Scriptures prophesied would come. It is God’s righteousness made visible through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. And now all who believe in him receive that gift. For there is really no difference between us, 
ROM.3.23	for we all have sinned and are in need of the glory of God. 
ROM.3.24	Yet through his powerful declaration of acquittal, God freely gives away his righteousness. His gift of love and favor now cascades over us, all because Jesus, the Anointed One, has liberated us from 
ROM.3.25	Jesus’ God-given destiny was to be the sacrifice to take away sins, and now he is our mercy seat because of his death on the cross. We come to him for mercy, for God has made a provision for us to be forgiven by faith in the sacred blood of Jesus. This is the perfect demonstration of God’s justice, because until now, he had been so patient—holding back his justice out of his tolerance for us. So he covered over the sins of those who lived prior to Jesus’ sacrifice. 
ROM.3.26	And when the season of tolerance came to an end, there was only one possible way for God to give away his righteousness and still be true to both his justice and his mercy—to offer up his own Son. So now, because we stand on the faithfulness of Jesus, God declares us righteous in his eyes!
ROM.3.27	Where, then, is there room for boasting? Do our works bring God’s acceptance? Not at all! It was not our works of keeping the law but our faith in his finished work 
ROM.3.28	So our conclusion is this: God’s wonderful declaration that we are righteous in his eyes can only come when we put our faith in Christ, and not in keeping the law.
ROM.3.29	After all, is God the God of the Jews only, or is he equally the God for all of humanity? Of course, he’s the God of all people! 
ROM.3.30	Since there is only one God, he will treat us all the same—he eliminates our guilt and makes us right with him by faith no matter who we are. 
ROM.3.31	Does emphasizing our faith invalidate the law? Absolutely not. Instead, our faith establishes the role the law should rightfully have.
ROM.4.1	Let me use Abraham as an example. It is clear that humanly speaking, he was the founder of Judaism. What was his experience of being made right with God? 
ROM.4.2	Was it by his good works of keeping the law? No. For if it was by the things he did, he would have something to boast about, but no one boasts before God. 
ROM.4.3	Listen to what the Scriptures say:
ROM.4.3	Because Abraham believed God’s words, his faith transferred God’s righteousness into his account.
ROM.4.4	When people work, they earn wages. It can’t be considered a free gift, because they earned it. 
ROM.4.5	But no one earns God’s righteousness. It can only be transferred when we no longer rely on our own works, but believe in the one who powerfully declares the ungodly to be righteous in his eyes. It is faith that transfers God’s righteousness into your account!
ROM.4.6	Even King David himself speaks to us regarding the complete wholeness that comes inside a person when God’s powerful declaration of righteousness is heard over our life. Apart from our works, God’s work is enough. 
ROM.4.7	Here’s what David says:
ROM.4.7	What happy fulfillment is ahead for those
ROM.4.7	whose rebellion has been forgiven
ROM.4.7	and whose sins are covered 
ROM.4.8	What happy progress comes to them
ROM.4.8	when they hear the Lord speak over them,
ROM.4.8	“I will never hold your sins against you!”
ROM.4.9	Now, think about it. Does this happiness come only to the Jews, or is it available to all who believe? Our answer is this: faith was credited to Abraham as God’s righteousness!
ROM.4.10	How did he receive this gift of righteousness? Was he circumcised at the time God accepted him, or was he still uncircumcised? Clearly, he was an uncircumcised gentile when God said this of him! 
ROM.4.11	It was later that he received the external sign of circumcision as a seal to confirm that God had already transferred his righteousness to him by faith, while he was still uncircumcised. So now this qualifies him to become the father of all who believe among the non-Jewish people. And like their “father of faith,” Abraham, God also transfers his righteousness to them by faith. 
ROM.4.12	Yes, Abraham is obviously the true father of faith for the Jewish people who are not only circumcised but who walk in the way of faith that our father Abraham displayed before his circumcision.
ROM.4.13	God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would have an heir who would reign over the world. This royal promise was not fulfilled because Abraham kept all the law, but through the righteousness that was transferred by faith. 
ROM.4.14	For if keeping the law earns the inheritance, then faith is robbed of its power and the promise becomes useless. 
ROM.4.15	For the law provokes punishment, and where no law exists there cannot be a violation of the law.
ROM.4.16	The promise depends on faith so that it can be experienced as a grace-gift, and now it extends to all the descendants of Abraham. This promise is not only meant for those who obey the law, but also to those who enter into the faith of Abraham, the father of us all. 
ROM.4.17	That’s what the Scripture means when it says:
ROM.4.17	“I have made you the father of many nations.”
ROM.4.17	He is our example and father, for in God’s presence he believed that God can raise the dead and call into being things that don’t even exist yet. 
ROM.4.18	Against all odds, when it looked hopeless, Abraham believed the promise and expected God to fulfill it. He took God at his word, and as a result he became the father of many nations. God’s declaration over him came to pass:
ROM.4.18	“Your descendants will be so many
ROM.4.18	that they will be impossible to count!”
ROM.4.19	In spite of being nearly one hundred years old when the promise of having a son was made, his faith was so strong that it could not be undermined by the fact that he and Sarah were incapable of conceiving a child. 
ROM.4.20+ROM.4.21	He never stopped believing God’s promise, for he was made strong in his faith 
ROM.4.22	So now you can see why Abraham’s faith was credited to his account as righteousness before God. 
ROM.4.23	And this declaration was not just spoken over Abraham, 
ROM.4.24	but also over us. For when we believe and embrace the one who brought our Lord Jesus back to life, perfect righteousness will be credited to our account as well. 
ROM.4.25	Jesus was handed over to be crucified for the forgiveness of our sins and was raised back to life to prove that he had made us right with God!
ROM.5.1	Our faith in Jesus transfers God’s righteousness to us and he now declares us flawless in his eyes. This means we can now enjoy true and lasting peace with God, all because of what our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has done for us. 
ROM.5.2	Our faith guarantees us permanent access into this marvelous kindness that has given us a perfect relationship with God. What incredible joy bursts forth within us as we keep on celebrating our hope of experiencing God’s glory!
ROM.5.3	But that’s not all! Even in times of trouble we have a joyful confidence, knowing that our pressures will develop in us patient endurance. 
ROM.5.4	And patient endurance will refine our character, and proven character leads us back to hope. 
ROM.5.5	And this hope is not a disappointing fantasy, because we can now experience the endless love of God cascading into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who lives in us!
ROM.5.6	For when the time was right, the Anointed One came and died 
ROM.5.7	Now, who of us would dare to die for the sake of a wicked person? We can all understand if someone was willing to die for a truly noble person. 
ROM.5.8	But Christ proved God’s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly!
ROM.5.9	And there is still much more to say of his unfailing love for us! For through the blood of Jesus we have heard the powerful declaration, “You are now righteous in my sight.” And because of the sacrifice of Jesus, you will never experience the wrath 
ROM.5.10	So if while we were still enemies, God fully reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son, then something greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, and because we share in his 
ROM.5.11	And even more than that, we overflow with triumphant joy in our new relationship of living reconciled to God—all because of Jesus Christ!
ROM.5.12	When Adam sinned, the entire world was affected. Sin entered human experience, and death was the result. And so death followed this sin, casting its shadow over all humanity, because all have sinned. 
ROM.5.13	Sin was in the world before Moses gave the written law, but it was not charged against them where no law existed. 
ROM.5.14	Yet death reigned as king from Adam to Moses even though they hadn’t broken a command 
ROM.5.15	Now, there is no comparison between Adam’s transgression and the gracious gift that we experience. 
ROM.5.16	And this free-flowing gift imparts to us much more than what was given to us through the one who sinned. For because of one transgression, we are all facing a death sentence with a verdict of “Guilty!” But this gracious gift leaves us free from our many failures and brings us into the perfect righteousness of God—acquitted with the words “Not guilty!”
ROM.5.17	Death once held us in its grip, and by the blunder of one man, death reigned as king over humanity. But now, how much more are we held in the grip of grace and continue reigning as kings in life, enjoying our regal freedom through the gift of perfect righteousness in the one and only Jesus, the Messiah!
ROM.5.18	In other words, just as condemnation came upon all people through one transgression, so through one righteous act 
ROM.5.19	One man’s disobedience opened the door for all humanity to become sinners. So also one man’s obedience opened the door for many to be made perfectly right with God and acceptable to him. 
ROM.5.20	So then, the law was introduced into God’s plan to bring the reality of human sinfulness out of hiding. And yet, wherever sin increased, there was more than enough of God’s grace to triumph all the more! 
ROM.5.21	And just as sin reigned through death, so also this sin-conquering grace will reign as king through righteousness, imparting eternal life through Jesus, our Lord and Messiah!
ROM.6.1	So what do we do, then? Do we persist in sin so that God’s kindness and grace will increase? 
ROM.6.2	What a terrible thought! We have died to sin once and for all, as a dead man passes away from this life. So how could we live under sin’s rule a moment longer? 
ROM.6.3	Or have you forgotten that all of us who were immersed into union with Jesus, the Anointed One, were immersed into union with his death?
ROM.6.4	Sharing in his death by our baptism means that we were co-buried and entombed with him, so that when the Father’s glory raised Christ from the dead, we were also raised with him. We have been co-resurrected with him so that we could be empowered to walk in the freshness of new life. 
ROM.6.5	For since we are permanently grafted into him to experience a death like his, then we are permanently grafted into him to experience a resurrection like his and the new life that it imparts.
ROM.6.6	Could it be any clearer that our former identity is now and forever deprived of its power? For we were co-crucified with him to dismantle the stronghold of sin within us, so that we would not continue to live one moment longer submitted to sin’s power.
ROM.6.7	Obviously, a dead person is incapable of sinning. 
ROM.6.8	And if we were co-crucified with the Anointed One, we know that we will also share in the fullness of his life. 
ROM.6.9	And we know that since the Anointed One has been raised from the dead to die no more, his resurrection life has vanquished death and its power over him is finished. 
ROM.6.10	For by his sacrifice he died to sin’s power once and for all, but he now lives continuously for the Father’s pleasure. 
ROM.6.11	So let it be the same way with you! Since you are now joined with him, you must continually view yourselves as dead and unresponsive to sin’s appeal while living daily for God’s pleasure in union with Jesus, the Anointed One.
ROM.6.12	Sin is a dethroned monarch; so you must no longer give it an opportunity to rule over your life, controlling how you live and compelling you to obey its desires and cravings. 
ROM.6.13	So then, refuse to answer its call to surrender your body as a tool for wickedness. Instead, passionately answer God’s call to keep yielding your body to him as one who has now experienced resurrection life! You live now for his pleasure, ready to be used for his noble purpose. 
ROM.6.14	Remember this: sin will not conquer you, for God already has! You are not governed by law but governed by the reign of the grace of God.
ROM.6.15	What are we to do, then? Should we sin to our hearts’ content since there’s no law to condemn us anymore? What a terrible thought! 
ROM.6.16	Don’t you realize that grace frees you to choose your own master? But choose carefully, for you surrender yourself to become a servant—bound to the one you choose to obey. If you choose to love sin, it will become your master, and it will own you and reward you with death. But if you choose to love and obey God, he will lead you into perfect righteousness.
ROM.6.17	And thanks be to God, for in the past you were servants of sin, but now your obedience is heart deep, and your life is being molded by truth through the teaching you are devoted to. 
ROM.6.18	And now you celebrate your freedom from your former master—sin. You’ve left its bondage, and now God’s perfect righteousness holds power over you as his loving servants.
ROM.6.19	I’ve used the familiar terms of a “servant” and a “master” to compensate for your weakness to understand. For just as you surrendered your bodies and souls to impurity and lawlessness, which only brought more lawlessness into your lives, so now surrender yourselves as servants of righteousness, which brings you deeper into true holiness. 
ROM.6.20	For when you were bound as servants to sin, you lived your lives free from any obligation to righteousness.
ROM.6.21	So tell me, what benefit ensued from doing those things that you’re now ashamed of? It left you with nothing but a legacy of shame and death. 
ROM.6.22	But now, as God’s loving servants, you live in joyous freedom from the power of sin. So consider the benefits you now enjoy—you are brought deeper into the experience of true holiness that ends with eternal life! 
ROM.6.23	For sin’s meager wages is death, but God’s lavish gift is life eternal, found in your union with our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.
ROM.7.1	I write to you, dear brothers and sisters, who are familiar with the law. Don’t you know that when a person dies, it ends his obligation to the law? 
ROM.7.2	For example, a married couple is bound by the law to remain together until separated by death. But when one spouse dies, the other is released from the law of the marriage. 
ROM.7.3	So then if a wife is joined to another man while still married, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is obviously free from the marriage contract and may marry another man without being charged with adultery.
ROM.7.4	So, my dear brothers and sisters, the same principle applies to your relationship with God. For you died to 
ROM.7.5	When we were merely living natural lives, the law, 
ROM.7.6	But now that we have been fully released from the power of the law, we are dead to what once controlled us. And our lives are no longer motivated by the obsolete way of following the written code, so that now we may serve God by living in the freshness of a new life in the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.7.7	So, what shall we say about all this? Am I suggesting that the law is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that gave us the clear definition of sin. For example, when the law said, “Do not covet,” it became the catalyst to see how wrong it was for me to crave what belongs to someone else. 
ROM.7.8	It was through God’s commandment that sin was awakened in me and built its base of operation within me to stir up every kind of wrong desire. For in the absence of the law, sin hides dormant.
ROM.7.9+ROM.7.10	I once lived without a clear understanding of the law, but when I heard God’s commandments, sin sprang to life and brought with it a death sentence. The commandment that was intended to bring life brought me death instead. 
ROM.7.11	Sin, by means of the commandment, built a base of operation within me, to overpower me and put me to death. 
ROM.7.12	So then, we have to conclude that the problem is not with the law itself, for the law is holy and its commandments are correct and for our good.
ROM.7.13	So, did something meant to be good become death to me? Certainly not! It was not the law but sin unmasked that produced my spiritual death. The sacred commandment merely uncovered the evil of sin so it could be seen for what it is. 
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is divinely inspired and comes from the spiritual realm, but I am a human being made of flesh and trafficked as a slave under sin’s authority.
ROM.7.15	I’m a mystery to myself, for I want to do what is right, but end up doing what my moral instincts condemn. 
ROM.7.16	And if my behavior is not in line with my desire, my conscience still confirms the excellence of the law. 
ROM.7.17	And now I realize that it is no longer my true self doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin in my humanity. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that nothing good lives within the flesh of my fallen humanity. The longings to do what is right are within me, but willpower is not enough to accomplish it. 
ROM.7.19	My lofty desires to do what is good are dashed when I do the things I want to avoid. 
ROM.7.20	So if my behavior contradicts my desires to do good, I must conclude that it’s not my true identity doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin 
ROM.7.21	Through my experience of this principle, I discover that even when I want to do good, evil is ready to sabotage me. 
ROM.7.22	Truly, deep within my true identity, I love to do what pleases God. 
ROM.7.23	But I discern another power operating in my humanity, waging a war against the moral principles of my conscience and bringing me into captivity as a prisoner to the “law” of sin—this unwelcome intruder in my humanity. 
ROM.7.24	What an agonizing situation I am in! So who has the power to rescue this miserable man from the unwelcome intruder of sin and death? 
ROM.7.25	I give all my thanks to God, for his mighty power has finally provided a way out through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One! So if left to myself, the flesh is aligned with the law of sin, but now my renewed mind is fixed on and submitted to God’s righteous principles.
ROM.8.1	 There remains no accusing voice of condemnation against those who are joined in life-union with Jesus, the Anointed One. 
ROM.8.2	For the “law” of the Spirit of life flowing through the anointing of Jesus has liberated us from the “law” of sin and death. 
ROM.8.3	For God achieved what the law was unable to accomplish, because the law was limited by the weakness of human nature.
ROM.8.3	Yet God sent us his Son in human form to identify with human weakness. Clothed with humanity, God’s Son gave his body to be the sin-offering so that God could once and for all condemn the guilt and power of sin. 
ROM.8.4	So now every righteous requirement of the law can be fulfilled through the Anointed One living his life in us. And we are free to live, not according to our flesh, but by the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit!
ROM.8.5	Those who are motivated by the flesh only pursue what benefits themselves. But those who live by the impulses of the Holy Spirit are motivated to pursue spiritual realities. 
ROM.8.6	For the mind-set of the flesh is death, but the mind-set controlled by the Spirit finds life and peace.
ROM.8.7	In fact, the mind-set focused on the flesh fights God’s plan and refuses to submit to his direction, because it cannot! 
ROM.8.8	For no matter how hard they try, God finds no pleasure with those who are controlled by the flesh. 
ROM.8.9	But when the Spirit of Christ empowers your life, you are not dominated by the flesh but by the Spirit. And if you are not joined to the Spirit of the Anointed One, you are not of him.
ROM.8.10	Now Christ lives his life in you! And even though your body may be dead because of the effects of sin, his life-giving Spirit imparts life to you because you are fully accepted by God. 
ROM.8.11	Yes, God raised Jesus to life! And since God’s Spirit of Resurrection lives in you, he will also raise your dying body to life by the same Spirit that breathes life into you!
ROM.8.12	So then, beloved ones, the flesh has no claims on us at all, and we have no further obligation to live in obedience to it. 
ROM.8.13	For when you live controlled by the flesh, you are about to die. But if the life of the Spirit puts to death the corrupt ways of the flesh, we then taste his abundant life.
ROM.8.14	The mature children of God are those who are moved by the impulses of the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.8.15	And you did not receive the “spirit of religious duty,” leading you back into the fear 
ROM.8.16	For the Holy Spirit makes God’s fatherhood real to us as he whispers into our innermost being, “You are God’s beloved child!”
ROM.8.17	And since we are his true children, we qualify to share all his treasures, for indeed, we are heirs of God himself. And since we are joined to Christ, we also inherit all that he is and all that he has. We will experience being co-glorified with him provided that we accept his sufferings as our own.
ROM.8.18	I am convinced that any suffering we endure is less than nothing compared to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us. 
ROM.8.19	The entire universe is standing on tiptoe, yearning to see the unveiling of God’s 
ROM.8.20	For against its will the universe itself has had to endure the empty futility resulting from the consequences of human sin. But now, with eager expectation, 
ROM.8.21	all creation longs for freedom from its slavery to decay and to experience with us the wonderful freedom coming to God’s children. 
ROM.8.22	To this day we are aware of the universal agony and groaning of creation, as if it were in the contractions of labor for childbirth. 
ROM.8.23	And it’s not just creation. We who have already experienced the firstfruits of the Spirit also inwardly groan as we passionately long to experience our full status as God’s sons and daughters—including our physical bodies being transformed. 
ROM.8.24	For this is the hope of our salvation.
ROM.8.24	But hope means that we must trust and wait for what is still unseen. For why would we need to hope for something we already have? 
ROM.8.25	So because our hope is set on what is yet to be seen, we patiently keep on waiting for its fulfillment.
ROM.8.26	And in a similar way, the Holy Spirit takes hold of us in our human frailty to empower us in our weakness. For example, at times we don’t even know how to pray, or know the best things to ask for. But the Holy Spirit rises up within us to super-intercede on our behalf, pleading to God with emotional sighs too deep for words.
ROM.8.27	God, the searcher of the heart, knows fully our longings, yet he also understands the desires of the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit passionately pleads before God for us, his holy ones, in perfect harmony with God’s plan and our destiny.
ROM.8.28	So we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God’s perfect plan of bringing good into our lives, for we are his lovers who have been called to fulfill his designed purpose. 
ROM.8.29	For he knew all about us before we were born and he destined us from the beginning to share the likeness of his Son. This means the Son is the oldest among a vast family of brothers and sisters who will become just like him.
ROM.8.30	Having determined our destiny ahead of time, he called us to himself and transferred his perfect righteousness to everyone he called. And those who possess his perfect righteousness he co-glorified with his Son!
ROM.8.31	So, what does all this mean? If God has determined to stand with us, tell me, who then could ever stand against us? 
ROM.8.32	For God has proved his love by giving us his greatest treasure, the gift of his Son. And since God freely offered him up as the sacrifice for us all, he certainly won’t withhold from us anything else he has to give.
ROM.8.33	Who then would dare to accuse those whom God has chosen in love to be his? God himself is the judge who has issued his final verdict over them—“Not guilty!”
ROM.8.34	Who then is left to condemn us? Certainly not Jesus, the Anointed One! For he gave his life for us, and even more than that, he has conquered death and is now risen, exalted, and enthroned by God at his right hand. So how could he possibly condemn us since he is continually praying 
ROM.8.35	Who could ever separate us from the endless love of God’s Anointed One? 
ROM.8.36	even though it is written:
ROM.8.36	All day long we face death threats for your sake, God.
ROM.8.36	We are considered to be nothing more
ROM.8.36	than sheep to be slaughtered!
ROM.8.37	Yet even in the midst of all these things, we triumph over them all, for God has made us to be more than conquerors, and his demonstrated love is our glorious victory over everything!
ROM.8.38	So now I live with the confidence that there is nothing in the universe with the power to separate us from God’s love. I’m convinced that his love will triumph over death, life’s troubles, fallen angels, or dark rulers in the heavens. There is nothing in our present or future circumstances that can weaken his love. 
ROM.8.39	There is no power above us or beneath us—no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God’s passionate love, which is lavished upon us through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!
ROM.9.1+ROM.9.2	O Israel, my Jewish family, I feel such great sorrow and heartache for you that never leaves me! God knows these deep feelings within me as I long for you to come to faith in the Anointed One. My conscience will not let me speak anything but the truth. 
ROM.9.3+ROM.9.4	For my grief is so intense that I wish that I would be accursed, cut off from the Messiah, if it would mean that you, my people, would come to faith in him!
ROM.9.3+ROM.9.4	You are Israelites, my fellow citizens, and God’s chosen people. To you belong God’s glorious presence, the covenants, the Torah, the temple with its required sacrifices, and the promises of God. 
ROM.9.5	We trace our beginnings back to the patriarchs, and through their bloodline is the genealogy of the Messiah, who is God over everything. May he be praised through endless ages! Amen!
ROM.9.6	Clearly, God has not failed to fulfill his promises to Israel, for that will never happen! But not everyone who has descended from Israel belongs to Israel. 
ROM.9.7	Physical descent from Abraham doesn’t guarantee the inheritance, because God has said:
ROM.9.7	“Through Isaac your descendants will be counted 
ROM.9.8	This confirms that it is not merely the natural offspring of Abraham who are considered the children of God; rather, the children born because of God’s promise are counted as descendants. 
ROM.9.9	For God promised Abraham:
ROM.9.9	“In nine months from now your wife, Sarah, will have a son!”
ROM.9.10	Now, this son was our ancestor, Isaac, who, with his wife, Rebekah, conceived twins. 
ROM.9.11+ROM.9.12	And before her twin sons were born, God spoke to Rebekah and said:
ROM.9.11+ROM.9.12	“The oldest will serve the younger.”
ROM.9.11+ROM.9.12	God spoke these words before the sons had done anything good or bad, which proves that God calls people not on the basis of their good or bad works, but according to his divine purpose. 
ROM.9.13	For in the words of Scripture:
ROM.9.13	“Jacob I have chosen, but Esau I have rejected.”
ROM.9.14	So, what does all this mean? Are we saying that God is unfair? Of course not! 
ROM.9.15	He had every right to say to Moses:
ROM.9.15	“I will be merciful to whomever I choose and I will show compassion to whomever I wish.”
ROM.9.16	Again, this proves that God’s choice doesn’t depend on how badly someone wants it or tries to earn it, but it depends on God’s kindness and mercy. 
ROM.9.17	For just as God said to Pharaoh:
ROM.9.17	“I raised you up as ruler of Egypt for this reason, that I might make you an example of how I demonstrate my miracle power. For by the example of how I deal with you, my powerful name will be a message proclaimed throughout the earth!”
ROM.9.18	So again we see that it is entirely up to God to show mercy or to harden the hearts of whomever he chooses.
ROM.9.19	Well then, one might ask, “If God is in complete control, how could he blame us? For who can resist whatever he wants done?”
ROM.9.20	But who do you think you are to second-guess God? How could a human being molded out of clay say to the one who molded him, “Why in the world did you make me this way?” 
ROM.9.21	Or are you denying the right of the potter to make out of clay whatever he wants? Doesn’t the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay an elegant vase or an ordinary pot?
ROM.9.22	And in the same way, although God has every right to unleash his anger and demonstrate his power, yet he is extremely patient with those who deserve wrath—vessels prepared for destruction. 
ROM.9.23	And doesn’t he also have the right to release the revelation of the wealth of his glory to his vessels of mercy, whom God prepared beforehand to receive his glory? 
ROM.9.24	Even for us, whether we are Jews or non-Jews, we are those he has called to experience his glory. 
ROM.9.25	Remember the prophecy God gave in Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“To those who were rejected and not my people,
ROM.9.25	I will say to them: ‘You are mine.’
ROM.9.25	And to those who were unloved I will say:
ROM.9.25	‘You are my darling.’ ”
ROM.9.26	And:
ROM.9.26	“In the place where they were told, ‘You are nobody,’
ROM.9.26	this will be the very place where they will be renamed
ROM.9.26	‘Children of the living God.’ ”
ROM.9.27	And the prophet Isaiah cries out to Israel:
ROM.9.27	Though the children of Israel
ROM.9.27	are as many as the sands of the seashore,
ROM.9.27	only a remnant will be saved.
ROM.9.28	For the Lord will act
ROM.9.28	and carry out his word on the earth,
ROM.9.28	and waste no time to accomplish it!
ROM.9.29	Just as Isaiah saw it coming and prophesied:
ROM.9.29	If the Lord God of angel armies
ROM.9.29	had not left us a remnant,
ROM.9.29	we would have been destroyed like Sodom
ROM.9.29	and left desolate like Gomorrah!
ROM.9.30	So then, what does all this mean? 
ROM.9.31	Yet Israel, even though pursuing a legal righteousness, did not attain to it. 
ROM.9.32	And why was that? Because they did not pursue the path of faith but insisted on pursuing righteousness by works, as if it could be seized another way. 
ROM.9.33	just as it is written:
ROM.9.33	“Be careful! I am setting in Zion a stone
ROM.9.33	that will cause people to stumble,
ROM.9.33	a rock of offense that will make them fall,
ROM.9.33	but believers in him will not experience shame.”
ROM.10.1	My beloved brothers and sisters, the passionate desire of my heart and constant prayer to God is for my fellow Israelites to experience salvation. 
ROM.10.2	For I know that although they are deeply devoted to God, they are unenlightened. 
ROM.10.3	And since they’ve ignored the righteousness God gives, wanting instead to be acceptable to God because of their own works, they’ve refused to submit to God’s faith-righteousness. 
ROM.10.4	For the Christ is the end of the law. And because of him, God has transferred his perfect righteousness to all who believe.
ROM.10.5	Moses wrote long ago about the need to obey every part of the law in order to be declared right with God:
ROM.10.5	“The one who obeys these things must always live by them.”
ROM.10.6	But we receive the faith-righteousness that speaks an entirely different message:
ROM.10.6	“Don’t for a moment think you need to climb into the heavens to find the Messiah and bring him down, 
ROM.10.7	or to descend into the underworld to bring him up from the dead.”
ROM.10.8	But the faith-righteousness we receive speaks to us in these words of Moses:
ROM.10.8	“God’s living message is very close to you, as close as your own heart beating in your chest and as near as the tongue in your mouth.”
ROM.10.9	And what is God’s “living message”? It is the revelation of faith for salvation, which is the message that we preach. For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will experience salvation. 
ROM.10.10	The heart that believes in him receives the gift of the righteousness of God—and then the mouth confesses, resulting in salvation. 
ROM.10.11	For the Scriptures encourage us with these words:
ROM.10.11	“Everyone who believes in him will never be disappointed.”
ROM.10.12	So then faith eliminates the distinction between Jew and non-Jew, for he is the same Lord for all people. And he has enough treasures to lavish generously upon all who call on him. 
ROM.10.13	And it’s true:
ROM.10.13	“Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
ROM.10.13	will be rescued and experience new life.”
ROM.10.14	But how can people call on him for help if they’ve not yet believed? And how can they believe in one they’ve not yet heard of? And how can they hear the message of life if there is no one there to proclaim it? 
ROM.10.15	And how can the message be proclaimed if messengers have yet to be sent? That’s why the Scriptures say:
ROM.10.15	How welcome is the arrival
ROM.10.15	of those proclaiming the joyful news of peace
ROM.10.15	and of good things to come!
ROM.10.16	But not everyone welcomes the good news, as Isaiah said:
ROM.10.16	Lord, is there anyone who hears
ROM.10.16	and believes our message?
ROM.10.17	Faith, then, is birthed in a heart that responds to God’s anointed utterance of the Anointed One.
ROM.10.18	Can it be that Israel hasn’t heard the message? No, they have heard it, for:
ROM.10.18	The voice has been heard throughout the world,
ROM.10.18	and its message has gone to the ends of the earth!
ROM.10.19	So again I ask, didn’t Israel already understand that God’s message was for others as well as for themselves? 
ROM.10.19	“I will make you jealous of a people who are ‘nobodies.’
ROM.10.19	And I will use people with no understanding
ROM.10.19	to provoke you to anger.”
ROM.10.20	And Isaiah the fearless prophet dared to declare:
ROM.10.20	“Those who found me weren’t even seeking me.
ROM.10.20	I manifested myself before those
ROM.10.20	who weren’t even asking to know me!”
ROM.10.21	Yet regarding Israel Isaiah says:
ROM.10.21	“With love I have held out my hands day after day,
ROM.10.21	offering myself to this unbelieving
ROM.10.21	and stubborn people!”
ROM.11.1	So then I ask you this question: did God really push aside and reject his people? Absolutely not! For I myself am a Jew, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	God has not rejected his chosen, destined people! Haven’t you heard Elijah’s testimony in the Scriptures, and how he prays to God, agonizing over Israel?
ROM.11.3	“Lord, they’ve murdered your prophets; they’ve demolished your altars. Now I’m the only one left and they want to kill me!”
ROM.11.4	But what was the revelation God spoke to him in response?
ROM.11.4	“
ROM.11.5	And that is but one example of what God is doing in this age of fulfillment, for God’s grace empowers his chosen remnant. 
ROM.11.6	And since it is by God’s grace, it can’t be a matter of their good works; otherwise, it wouldn’t be a gift of grace, but earned by human effort.
ROM.11.7	So then, Israel failed to achieve what it had strived for, but the divinely chosen remnant receives it by grace, while the rest were hardened 
ROM.11.8	Just as it is written:
ROM.11.8	God granted them a spirit of deep slumber.
ROM.11.8	He closed their eyes to the truth
ROM.11.8	and prevented their ears from hearing
ROM.11.8	up to this very day.
ROM.11.9	And King David also prophesied this:
ROM.11.9	May their table prove to be a snare
ROM.11.9	and a trap to cause their ruin.
ROM.11.9	Bring them the retribution they deserve.
ROM.11.10	Blindfold their eyes and don’t let them see.
ROM.11.10	Let them be stooped over continually.
ROM.11.11	So, am I saying that Israel stumbled so badly that they will never get back up? Certainly not! Rather, it was because of their stumble that salvation now extends to all the non-Jewish people, in order to make Israel jealous and desire the very things that God has freely given them. 
ROM.11.12	So if all the world is being greatly enriched through their failure, and through their fall great spiritual wealth is given to the non-Jewish people, imagine how much more will Israel’s awakening bring to us all!
ROM.11.13	Now, I speak to you who are not Jewish, since I am an apostle to reach the non-Jewish people. And I draw attention to this ministry as much as I can when I am among the Jews, 
ROM.11.14	hoping to make them jealous of what God has given to those who are not Jews, winning some of my people to salvation.
ROM.11.15	For if their 
ROM.11.16	Since Abraham and the patriarchs are consecrated and set apart for God, so also will their descendants be set apart. If the roots of a tree are holy and set apart for God, so too will be the branches.
ROM.11.17	However, some of the branches have been pruned away. And you, who were once nothing more than a wild olive branch, God has grafted in—inserting you among the remaining branches as a joint partner to share in the wonderful richness of the cultivated olive stem. 
ROM.11.18	So don’t be so arrogant as to believe that you are superior to the natural branches. There’s no reason to boast, for the new branches don’t support the root, but you owe your life to the root that supports you!
ROM.11.19	You might begin to think that some branches were pruned or broken off just to make room for you. 
ROM.11.20	Yes, that’s true. They were removed because of their unbelief. But remember this: you are only attached by your faith. So don’t be presumptuous, but stand in awe and reverence. 
ROM.11.21	Since God didn’t spare the natural branches that fell into unbelief, perhaps he won’t spare you either!
ROM.11.22	So fix your gaze on the simultaneous kindness and strict justice of God. How severely he treated those who fell into unbelief! Yet how tender and kind is his relationship with you. So keep on trusting in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be cut off.
ROM.11.23	God is more than ready to graft back in the natural branches when they turn from clinging to their unbelief to embracing faith. 
ROM.11.24	For if God grafted you in, even though you were taken from what is by nature a wild olive tree, how much more can he reconnect the natural branches by inserting them back into their own cultivated olive tree!
ROM.11.25	My beloved brothers and sisters, I want to share with you a mystery concerning Israel’s future. For understanding this mystery will keep you from thinking you already know everything.
ROM.11.25	A partial and temporary hardening to the gospel has come over Israel, which will last until the full number of non-Jews has come into God’s family. 
ROM.11.26	And then God will bring all of Israel to salvation! The prophecy will be fulfilled that says:
ROM.11.26	“Coming from Zion will be the Savior,
ROM.11.26	and he will turn Jacob away from evil.
ROM.11.27	For this is my covenant promise with them
ROM.11.27	when I forgive their sins.”
ROM.11.28	Now, many of the Jews are opposed to the gospel, but their opposition has opened the door of the gospel to you who are not Jewish. Yet they are still greatly loved by God because their ancestors were divinely chosen to be his. 
ROM.11.29	And when God chooses someone and graciously imparts gifts to him, they are never rescinded.
ROM.11.30	You who are not Jews were once rebels against God, but now, because of their disobedience, you have experienced God’s tender mercies. 
ROM.11.31	And now they are the rebels, and because of God’s tender mercies to you, you can open the door to them to share in and enjoy what God has given to us!
ROM.11.32	Actually, God considers all of humanity to be prisoners of their unbelief, so that he can unlock our hearts and show his tender mercies to all who come to him.
ROM.11.33	Who could ever wrap their minds around the riches of God, the depth of his wisdom, and the marvel of his perfect knowledge? Who could ever explain the wonder of his decisions or search out the mysterious way he carries out his plans?
ROM.11.34	For who has discovered how the Lord thinks
ROM.11.34	or is wise enough to be the one
ROM.11.34	to advise him in his plans?
ROM.11.35	Or:
ROM.11.35	“Who has ever first given something to God
ROM.11.35	that obligates God to owe him something in return?”
ROM.11.36	For out of him, the sustainer of everything, came everything, and now everything finds fulfillment in him. May all praise and honor be given to him forever! Amen!
ROM.12.1	Beloved friends, what should be our proper response to God’s marvelous mercies? I encourage you to surrender yourselves to God to be his sacred, living sacrifices. And live in holiness, experiencing all that delights his heart. For this becomes your genuine expression of worship.
ROM.12.2	Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you, but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God’s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.
ROM.12.3	God has given me grace to speak a warning about pride. I would ask each of you to be emptied of self-promotion and not create a false image of your importance. Instead, honestly assess your worth by using your God-given faith as the standard of measurement, and then you will see your true value with an appropriate self-esteem.
ROM.12.4	In the human body there are many parts and organs, each with a unique function. 
ROM.12.5	And so it is in the body of Christ. For though we are many, we’ve all been mingled into one body in Christ. This means that we are all vitally joined to one another, with each contributing to the others.
ROM.12.6	God’s marvelous grace imparts to each one of us varying gifts and ministries that are uniquely ours. So if God has given you the grace-gift of prophecy, you must activate your gift by using the proportion of faith you have to prophesy. 
ROM.12.7	If your grace-gift is serving, then thrive in serving others well. If you have the grace-gift of teaching, then be actively teaching and training others. 
ROM.12.8	If you have the grace-gift of encouragement, then use it often to encourage others. If you have the grace-gift of giving to meet the needs of others, then may you prosper in your generosity without any fanfare. If you have the gift of leadership, be passionate about your leadership. And if you have the gift of showing compassion, then flourish in your cheerful display of compassion.
ROM.12.9	Let the inner movement of your heart always be to love one another, and never play the role of an actor wearing a mask. Despise evil and embrace everything that is good and virtuous.
ROM.12.10	Be devoted to tenderly loving your fellow believers 
ROM.12.11	Be enthusiastic to serve the Lord, keeping your passion toward him boiling hot! Radiate with the glow of the Holy Spirit and let him fill you with excitement as you serve him.
ROM.12.12	Let this hope burst forth within you, releasing a continual joy. Don’t give up in a time of trouble, but commune with God at all times.
ROM.12.13	Take a constant interest in the needs of God’s beloved people and respond by helping them. And eagerly welcome people as guests into your home.
ROM.12.14	Speak blessing, not cursing, over those who reject and persecute you.
ROM.12.15	Celebrate with those who celebrate, and weep with those who grieve. 
ROM.12.16	Live happily together in a spirit of harmony, and be as mindful of another’s worth as you are your own. Don’t live with a lofty mind-set, thinking you are too important to serve others, but be willing to do menial tasks and identify with those who are humble minded. Don’t be smug or even think for a moment that you know it all.
ROM.12.17	Never hold a grudge or try to get even, but plan your life around the noblest way to benefit others. 
ROM.12.18	Do your best to live as everybody’s friend.
ROM.12.19	Beloved, don’t be obsessed with taking revenge, but leave that to God’s righteous justice. For the Scriptures say:
ROM.12.19	“Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,” says the Lord.
ROM.12.20	And:
ROM.12.20	If your enemy is hungry, buy him lunch!
ROM.12.20	Win him over with kindness.
ROM.12.20	For your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience,
ROM.12.20	and God will reward you with favor.
ROM.12.21	Never let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Every person must submit to and support the authorities over him. For there can be no authority in the universe except by God’s appointment, which means that every authority that exists has been instituted by God. 
ROM.13.2	So to resist authority is to resist the divine order of God, which results in severe consequences. 
ROM.13.3	For civil authorities don’t intimidate those who are doing good, but those who are doing evil. So do what is right and you’ll never need to fear those in authority. They will commend you for your good citizenship.
ROM.13.4	Those in authority are God’s servants for the good of society. But if you break the law, you have reason to be alarmed, for they are God’s agents of punishment to bring criminals to justice. Why do you think they carry weapons? 
ROM.13.5	You are compelled to obey them, not just to avoid punishment, but because you want to live with a clean conscience.
ROM.13.6	This is also the reason you pay your taxes, for governmental authorities are God’s officials who oversee these things. 
ROM.13.7	So it is your duty to pay all the taxes and fees that they require and to respect those who are worthy of respect, honoring them accordingly.
ROM.13.8	Don’t owe anything to anyone, except your outstanding debt to continually love one another, for the one who learns to love has fulfilled every requirement of the law. 
ROM.13.9	For the commandments, “Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,” and every other commandment can be summed up in these words:
ROM.13.9	“Love and value others the same way you love and value yourself.”
ROM.13.10	Love makes it impossible to harm another, so love fulfills all that the law requires.
ROM.13.11	To live like this is all the more urgent, for time is running out and you know it is a strategic hour in human history. It is time for us to wake up! For our full salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
ROM.13.12	Night’s darkness is dissolving away as a new day of destiny dawns. So we must once and for all strip away what is done in the shadows of darkness, 
ROM.13.13	We must live honorably, surrounded by the light of this new day, not in the darkness of drunkenness and debauchery, not in promiscuity and sensuality, not being argumentative or jealous of others.
ROM.13.14	Instead fully immerse yourselves into the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, and don’t waste even a moment’s thought on your former identity to awaken its selfish desires.
ROM.14.1	Offer an open hand of fellowship to welcome every true believer, even though their faith may be weak and immature. And refuse to engage in debates with them concerning nothing more than opinions.
ROM.14.2	For example, one believer has no problem with eating all kinds of food, but another with weaker faith will eat only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	The one who eats freely shouldn’t judge and look down on the one who eats only vegetables. And the vegetarian must not judge and look down on the one who eats everything. Remember, God has welcomed him and taken him as his partner.
ROM.14.4	Who do you think you are to sit in judgment of someone else’s household servant? His own master is the one to evaluate whether he succeeds or fails. And God’s servants will succeed, for God’s power supports them and enables them to stand.
ROM.14.5	In the same way, one person regards a certain day as more sacred than another, and another person regards them all alike. There is nothing wrong with having different personal convictions about such matters. 
ROM.14.6	For the person who observes one day as especially sacred does it to honor the Lord. And the same is true regarding what a person eats. The one who eats everything eats to honor the Lord, because he gives thanks to God, and the one who has a special diet does it to honor the Lord, and he also gives thanks to God.
ROM.14.7	No one lives to himself and no one dies to himself. 
ROM.14.8	While we live, we must live for our Master, and in death we must bring honor to him. So dead or alive we belong to our Master. 
ROM.14.9	For this very reason the Anointed One died and was brought back to life again, so that he would become the Lord God over both the dead and the living.
ROM.14.10	Why would you judge your brothers or sisters because of their diet, despising them for what they eat or don’t eat? For we each will have our turn to stand before God’s judgment seat. 
ROM.14.11	Just as it is written:
ROM.14.11	“As surely as I am the Living God, I tell you:
ROM.14.11	‘Every knee will bow before me
ROM.14.11	and every tongue will confess the truth
ROM.14.11	and glorify me!’ ”
ROM.14.12	Therefore, each one must answer for himself and give a personal account of his own life before God.
ROM.14.13	So stop being critical and condemning of other believers, but instead determine to never deliberately cause a brother or sister to stumble and fall because of your actions.
ROM.14.14	I know and am convinced by personal revelation from the Lord Jesus that there is nothing wrong with eating any food. But to the one who considers it to be unclean, it is unacceptable. 
ROM.14.15	If your brother or sister is offended because you insist on eating what you want, it is no longer love that rules your conduct. Why would you wound someone for whom the Messiah gave his life, just so you can eat what you want? 
ROM.14.16	So don’t give people the opportunity to slander what you know to be good. 
ROM.14.17	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of rules about food and drink, but is in the realm of the Holy Spirit, filled with righteousness, peace, and joy. 
ROM.14.18	Serving the Anointed One by walking in these kingdom realities pleases God and earns the respect of others.
ROM.14.19	So then, make it your top priority to live a life of peace with harmony in your relationships, eagerly seeking to strengthen and encourage one another. 
ROM.14.20	Stop ruining the work of God by insisting on your own opinions about food. You can eat anything you want, but it is wrong to deliberately cause someone to be offended over what you eat. 
ROM.14.21	 to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine or doing anything else that would cause a fellow believer to be offended or tempted to be weakened in his faith. 
ROM.14.22	Keep the convictions you have about these matters between yourself and God, 
ROM.14.23	But the one who has misgivings feels miserable if he eats meat, because he doubts and doesn’t eat in faith. For anything we do that doesn’t spring from faith is, by definition, sinful.
ROM.15.1	Now, those who are mature in their faith can easily be recognized, for they don’t live to please themselves but have learned to patiently embrace others in their immaturity. 
ROM.15.2	Our goal must be to empower others to do what is right and good for them, and to bring them into spiritual maturity. 
ROM.15.3	For not even 
ROM.15.3	All the insults of those who insulted you fall upon me.
ROM.15.4	Whatever was written beforehand is meant to instruct us in how to live. The Scriptures impart to us encouragement and inspiration so that we can live in hope and endure all things.
ROM.15.5	Now may God, the source of great endurance and comfort, grace you with unity among yourselves, which flows from your relationship with Jesus, the Anointed One. 
ROM.15.6	Then, with a unanimous rush of passion, you will with one voice glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ROM.15.7	You will bring God glory when you accept and welcome one another as partners, just as the Anointed One has fully accepted you and received you as his partner.
ROM.15.8	I am convinced that Jesus, the Messiah, was sent as a servant to the Jewish people to fulfill the promises God made to our ancestors and to prove God’s faithfulness. 
ROM.15.9	And now, because of Jesus, the non-Jewish people of the world can glorify God for his kindness to them, fulfilling the prophecy of Scripture:
ROM.15.9	Because of this I will proclaim you among the nations
ROM.15.9	and they will hear me sing praises to your name.
ROM.15.10	And in another place it says:
ROM.15.10	“You who are not Jewish,
ROM.15.10	celebrate life right alongside his Jewish people.”
ROM.15.11	And again:
ROM.15.11	Praise the Lord, all you who are not Jews,
ROM.15.11	and let all the people of the earth
ROM.15.11	raise their voices in praises to him.
ROM.15.12	And Isaiah prophesied:
ROM.15.12	“An heir to David’s throne will emerge,
ROM.15.12	and he will rise up as ruler
ROM.15.12	over all the non-Jewish nations,
ROM.15.12	for all their hopes will be met in him.”
ROM.15.13	Now may God, the inspiration and fountain of hope, fill you to overflowing with uncontainable joy and perfect peace as you trust in him. And may the power of the Holy Spirit continually surround your life with his super-abundance until you radiate with hope!
ROM.15.14	My dear brothers and sisters, I am fully convinced of your genuine spirituality. I know that each of you is stuffed full of God’s goodness, that you are richly supplied with all kinds of revelation-knowledge, and that you are empowered to effectively instruct one another. 
ROM.15.15	And because of the outpouring of God’s grace on my life to be his minister and to preach Jesus, the Anointed One, to the non-Jewish people, I have written rather boldly to you on some themes, reminding you of their importance. 
ROM.15.16	For this grace has made me a servant of the gospel of God, constantly doing the work of a priest, for I endeavor to present an acceptable offering to God; so that the non-Jewish people of the earth may be set apart and made holy by the Spirit of holiness.
ROM.15.17	Now then, it is through my union with Jesus Christ, that I enjoy an enthusiasm and confidence in my ministry for God. 
ROM.15.18+ROM.15.19	And I will not be presumptuous to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me. For many non-Jewish people are coming into faith’s obedience by the power of the Spirit of God, which is displayed through mighty signs and amazing wonders, both in word and deed. Starting from Jerusalem I went from place to place as far as the distant Roman province of Illyricum, fully preaching the wonderful message of Christ. 
ROM.15.20	It is my honor and constant passion to be a pioneer who preaches where no one has ever even heard of the Anointed One, instead of building upon someone else’s foundation. 
ROM.15.21	As the Scriptures say:
ROM.15.21	Those who know nothing about him will clearly see him,
ROM.15.21	and those who have not heard will respond.
ROM.15.22	My pursuit of this mission has prevented me many times from visiting you, 
ROM.15.23	but there is now nothing left to keep me in these regions. So many years I have longed to come and be with you! 
ROM.15.24	So on my way to Spain I hope to visit you as I pass through Rome. And after I have enjoyed fellowship with you for a while, I hope that you would help me financially on my journey. 
ROM.15.25	But now I’m on my way to Jerusalem to encourage God’s people and minister to them.
ROM.15.26	I am pleased to inform you that the believers of Macedonia and Greece have made a generous contribution for the poor among the holy believers in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	They were thrilled to have an opportunity to give back to the believers in Jerusalem. For indeed, they are deeply grateful for them and feel indebted because they brought them the gospel. Since the ethnic multitudes have shared in the spiritual wealth of the Jewish people, it is only right that the non-Jewish people share their material wealth with them.
ROM.15.28	So, when I have completed this act of worship and safely delivered the offering to them in Jerusalem, I will set out for Spain and visit you on my way there. 
ROM.15.29	I am convinced that when I come to you, I will come packed full and loaded with the blessings of the Anointed One!
ROM.15.30	That’s why I plead with you, because of our union with our Lord Jesus Christ, to be partners with me in your prayers to God. My dear brothers and sisters in the faith, with the love we share in the Holy Spirit, fight alongside me in prayer. 
ROM.15.31	Ask the Father to deliver me from the danger I face from the unbelievers in Judea. For I want to make sure that the contribution I carry for Jerusalem will be favorably received by God’s holy ones. 
ROM.15.32	Then he will send me to you with great joy in the pleasure of God’s will, and I will be spiritually refreshed by your fellowship.
ROM.15.33	And now may the God who gives us his peace and wholeness be with you all. Yes, Lord, so let it be!
ROM.16.1	Now, let me introduce to you our dear and beloved sister in the faith, Phoebe, a shining minister of the church in Cenchrea. 
ROM.16.2	I am sending her with this letter and ask that you shower her with your hospitality when she arrives. Embrace her with honor, as is fitting for one who belongs to the Lord and is set apart for him. So provide her whatever she may need, for she’s been a great leader and champion for many—I know, for she’s been that for even me!
ROM.16.3	Give my love to Prisca and Aquila, my partners in ministry serving the Anointed One, Jesus, 
ROM.16.4	for they’ve risked their own lives to save mine. I’m so thankful for them, and not just I, but all the congregations among the non-Jewish people respect them for their ministry. 
ROM.16.5	Also give my loving greetings to all the believers in their house church.
ROM.16.5	And greet Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the Roman province of Asia, for I love him dearly.
ROM.16.6	And give my greetings to Miriam, who has toiled and labored extremely hard to benefit you.
ROM.16.7	Make sure that my relatives Andronicus and Junia are honored, for they’re my fellow captives who bear the distinctive mark of being outstanding and well-known apostles, and who were joined into the Anointed One before me.
ROM.16.8	Give my regards to Ampliatus, whom I love, for he is joined into the Lord.
ROM.16.9	And give my loving greetings to Urbanus, our partner in ministry serving the Anointed One, and also to Stachus, whom I love.
ROM.16.10	Don’t forget to greet Apelles for me, for he’s been tested and found to be approved by the Anointed One.
ROM.16.10	And extend warm greetings to all those of Aristobolos’s house church.
ROM.16.11	Give my love to my relative Herodion, and also to all those of the house church of Narcissus, for they too are joined into the Lord.
ROM.16.12	Please greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, for they are women who have diligently served the Lord.
ROM.16.12	To Persis, who is much loved and faithful in her ministry for the Lord, I send my greetings.
ROM.16.13	And Rufus, for he is especially chosen by the Lord. And I greet his mother, who was like a mother to me.
ROM.16.14	I cannot forget to mention my esteemed friends Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the brothers and sisters who meet with them.
ROM.16.15	Give my regards to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and also Olympas and all the holy believers who meet with them.
ROM.16.16	Greet each other with a holy kiss 
ROM.16.17	And now, dear brothers and sisters, I’d like to give one final word of caution: Watch out for those who cause divisions and offenses among you. When they antagonize you by speaking of things that are contrary to the teachings that you’ve received, don’t be caught in their snare! 
ROM.16.18	For people like this are not truly serving the Lord, our Messiah, but are being driven by their own desires for a following. Utilizing their smooth words and well-rehearsed blessings, they seek to deceive the hearts of innocent ones.
ROM.16.19	I’m so happy when I think of you, because everyone knows the testimony of your deep commitment of faith. So I want you to become scholars of all that is good and beautiful, and stay pure and innocent when it comes to evil. 
ROM.16.20	And the God of peace will swiftly pound Satan to a pulp under your feet! And the wonderful favor of our Lord Jesus will surround you.
ROM.16.21	My ministry partner, Timothy, sends his loving greetings, along with Luke, Jason, and Sosipater, my Jewish kinsmen.
ROM.16.22	(I, Tertius, am the one transcribing this letter for Paul, and I too send my greetings to all of you, as a follower of the Lord.)
ROM.16.23	My kind host here in Corinth, Gaius, likewise greets you, along with the entire congregation of his house church. Also, the city administrator Erastus and our brother Quartus send their warm greetings.
ROM.16.24	May the grace and favor of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, continually rest upon you all.
ROM.16.25	I give all my praises and glory to the one who has more than enough power to make you strong and keep you steadfast through the promises found in the wonderful news that I preach; that is, the proclamation of Jesus, the Anointed One. This wonderful news includes the unveiling of the mystery kept secret from the dawn of creation until now. 
ROM.16.26	This mystery is understood through the prophecies of the Scripture and by the decree of the eternal God. And it is now heard openly by all the nations, igniting within them a deep commitment of faith.
ROM.16.27	Now to God, the only source of wisdom, be glorious praises for endless ages through Jesus, the Anointed One! Amen!
ROM.16.27	(Paul’s letter was transcribed by Tertius in Corinth and sent from Corinth and carried to Rome by Phoebe.)
1CO.1.1	From Paul, divinely appointed according to the plan of God, to be an apostle of the Anointed One, Jesus. Our fellow believer Sosthenes joins me 
1CO.1.2	in writing you this letter addressed to the community of God throughout the city of Corinth. For you have been made pure, set apart in the Anointed One, Jesus. And God has invited you to be his devoted and holy people, and not only you, but everyone everywhere who calls on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord, and ours also.
1CO.1.3	May joyous grace and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!
1CO.1.4	I am always thanking my God for you because he has given you such free and open access to his grace through your union with Jesus, the Messiah. 
1CO.1.5	In him you have been made extravagantly rich in every way. You have been endowed with a wealth of inspired utterance and the riches that come from your intimate knowledge of him. 
1CO.1.6	For the reality of the truth of Christ is seen among you and strengthened through your experience of him. 
1CO.1.7	So now you aren’t lacking any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the unveiling of the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. 
1CO.1.8	He will keep you steady and strong to the very end, making your character mature so that you will be found innocent on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.9	God is forever faithful and can be trusted to do this in you, for he has invited you to co-share the life of his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One, our King!
1CO.1.10	I urge you, my brothers and sisters, for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree to live in unity with one another and put to rest any division that attempts to tear you apart. Be restored as one united body living in perfect harmony. Form a consistent choreography among yourselves, having a common perspective with shared values.
1CO.1.11	My dear brothers and sisters, 
1CO.1.12	And I need to bring this up because each of you is claiming loyalty to different preachers. Some are saying, “I am a disciple of Paul,” or, “I follow Apollos,” or, “I am a disciple of Peter the Rock,” and some, “I belong 
1CO.1.13	But 
1CO.1.14	Thank God I only baptized two from Corinth—Crispus and Gaius! 
1CO.1.15	So now no one can say that in my name I baptized others. 
1CO.1.16	(Yes, I also baptized Stephanus and his family. Other than that, I don’t remember baptizing anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	For the Anointed One has sent me on a mission, not to see how many I could baptize, but to proclaim the good news. And I declare this message stripped of all philosophical arguments that empty the cross of its true power. For I trust in the all-sufficient cross of Christ alone.
1CO.1.18	To preach the message of the cross seems like sheer nonsense to those who are on their way to destruction, but to us who are on our way to salvation, it is the mighty power of God released within us. 
1CO.1.19	For it is written:
1CO.1.19	I will dismantle the wisdom of the wise
1CO.1.19	and I will invalidate the intelligence of the scholars.
1CO.1.20	So where is the wise philosopher 
1CO.1.21	For in his wisdom, 
1CO.1.22	For the Jews constantly demand to see miraculous signs, while those who are not Jews constantly cling to the world’s wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	but we preach the crucified Messiah. The Jews stumble over him and the rest of the world sees him as foolishness. 
1CO.1.24	But for those who have been chosen to follow him, both Jews and Greeks, he is God’s mighty power, God’s true wisdom, and our Messiah. 
1CO.1.25	For the “foolish” things of God have proven to be wiser than human wisdom. And the “feeble” things of God have proven to be far more powerful than any human ability.
1CO.1.26	Brothers and sisters, consider who you were when God called you 
1CO.1.27	But God chose those whom the world considers foolish to shame those who think they are wise, and God chose the puny and powerless to shame the high and mighty. 
1CO.1.28	He chose the lowly, the laughable in the world’s eyes—nobodies—so that he would shame the somebodies. For he chose what is regarded as insignificant in order to supersede what is regarded as prominent, 
1CO.1.29	so that there would be no place for prideful boasting in God’s presence. 
1CO.1.30	 but from God as we are being joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. And now he is our God-given wisdom, our virtue, our holiness, and our redemption. 
1CO.1.31	And this fulfills what is written:
1CO.1.31	If anyone boasts, let him only boast
1CO.1.31	in all that the Lord has done!
1CO.2.1	My brothers and sisters, when I first came to proclaim to you the secrets of God, I refused to come 
1CO.2.2	For while I was with you I was determined to be consumed with one topic—Jesus, the crucified Messiah. 
1CO.2.3	I stood before you feeling inadequate, filled with reverence for God, and trembling 
1CO.2.4	The message I preached and how I preached it was not an attempt to sway you with persuasive arguments but to prove to you the almighty power of God’s Holy Spirit. 
1CO.2.5	For God intended that your faith not be established on man’s wisdom but by trusting in his almighty power.
1CO.2.6	However, there is a wisdom that we continually speak of when we are among the spiritually mature. It’s wisdom that didn’t originate in this present age, nor did it come from the rulers of this age who are in the process of being dethroned. 
1CO.2.7	Instead, we continually speak of this wonderful wisdom that comes from God, hidden before now in a mystery. It is his secret plan, destined before the ages, 
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this present world order understood it, for if they had, they never would have crucified the Lord of shining glory. 
1CO.2.9	This is why the Scriptures say:
1CO.2.9	Things never discovered or heard of before,
1CO.2.9	things beyond our ability to imagine—
1CO.2.9	these are the many things God has in store
1CO.2.9	for all his lovers.
1CO.2.10	But God now unveils these profound realities to us by the Spirit. Yes, he has revealed to us his inmost heart and deepest mysteries through the Holy Spirit, who constantly explores all things. 
1CO.2.11	After all, who can really see into a person’s heart and know his hidden impulses except for that person’s spirit? So it is with God. His thoughts and secrets are only fully understood by his Spirit, the Spirit of God.
1CO.2.12	For we did not receive the spirit of this world system but the Spirit of God, so that we might come to understand and experience all that grace has lavished upon us. 
1CO.2.13	And we articulate these realities with the words imparted to us by the Spirit and not with the words taught by human wisdom. We join together Spirit-revealed truths with Spirit-revealed words. 
1CO.2.14	Someone living on an entirely human level rejects the revelations of God’s Spirit, for they make no sense to him. He can’t understand the revelations of the Spirit because they are only discovered by the illumination of the Spirit. 
1CO.2.15	Those who live in the Spirit are able to carefully evaluate all things, and they are subject to the scrutiny of no one 
1CO.2.16	For
1CO.2.16	Who has ever intimately known the mind of the Lord Yahweh well enough to become his counselor?
1CO.2.16	, and we possess Christ’s perceptions.
1CO.3.1	Brothers and sisters, when I was with you I found it impossible to speak to you as those who are spiritually mature people, for you are still dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. And because you are immature infants in Christ, 
1CO.3.2	I had to nurse you and feed you with “milk,” not with the solid food 
1CO.3.3	for you are living your lives dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. Ask yourselves: Is there jealousy among you? Do you compare yourselves with others? Do you quarrel 
1CO.3.4	For when you divide yourselves up in groups—a “Paul group” and an “Apollos group”—you’re acting like people without the Spirit’s influence.
1CO.3.5	Who is Apollos, really? Or who is Paul? Aren’t we both just servants through whom you believed our message? Aren’t each of us doing the ministry the Lord has assigned to us? 
1CO.3.6	I was the one who planted the church and Apollos came and cared for it, but it was God who caused it to grow. 
1CO.3.7	This means the one who plants is not anybody special, nor the one who waters, for God is the one who brings the supernatural growth.
1CO.3.8	Now, the one who plants and the one who waters are 
1CO.3.9	We are coworkers with God and you are God’s cultivated garden, the house he is building. 
1CO.3.10	God has given me unique gifts as a skilled master builder who lays a good foundation. Afterward another craftsman comes and builds on it. So builders beware! Let every builder do his work carefully, according to God’s standards. 
1CO.3.11	For no one is empowered to lay an alternative foundation other than the good foundation that exists, which is Jesus Christ!
1CO.3.12+1CO.3.13	The quality of materials used by anyone building on this foundation will soon be made apparent, whether it has been built with gold, silver, and costly stones, or wood, hay, and straw. Their work will soon become evident, for the Day will make it clear, because it will be revealed by blazing fire! And the fire will test and prove the workmanship of each builder. 
1CO.3.14	If his work stands the test of fire, he will be rewarded. 
1CO.3.15	If his work is consumed by the fire, he will suffer great loss. Yet he himself will barely escape destruction, like one being rescued out of a burning house.
1CO.3.16	Don’t you realize that together you have become God’s inner sanctuary and that the Spirit of God makes his permanent home in you? 
1CO.3.17	Now, if someone desecrates God’s inner sanctuary, God will desecrate him, for God’s inner sanctuary is holy, and that is exactly who you are.
1CO.3.18	So why fool yourself and live under an illusion? Make no mistake about it, if anyone thinks he is wise by the world’s standards, he will be made wiser by being a fool for God! 
1CO.3.19	For what the world says is wisdom is actually foolishness in God’s eyes. As it is written:
1CO.3.19	The cleverness of the know-it-alls
1CO.3.19	becomes the trap that ensnares them.
1CO.3.20	And again:
1CO.3.20	The Lord sees right through
1CO.3.20	the clever reasonings of the wise
1CO.3.20	and knows that it’s all a sham.
1CO.3.21	So don’t be proud of your allegiance to any human leader. For actually, you already have everything! It has all been given for your benefit, 
1CO.3.22	whether it is Paul or Apollos or Peter the Rock, or whether it’s the world or life or death, or whether it’s the present or the future—everything belongs to you! 
1CO.3.23	And now you are joined to the Messiah, who is joined to God.
1CO.4.1	So then you must perceive us—
1CO.4.2	The most important quality of one entrusted with such secrets is that they are faithful and trustworthy. 
1CO.4.3	But personally, I’m not the least bit concerned if I’m judged by you or any verdict I receive from any human court. In fact, I don’t even assume to be my own judge, 
1CO.4.4	even though my conscience is clear. But that doesn’t mean I stand acquitted before the Lord, for the only judge I care about is him!
1CO.4.5	So resist the temptation to pronounce premature judgment on anything before the appointed time 
1CO.4.6	Dear brothers and sisters, I’ve been referring allusively to myself and Apollos in order to illustrate what I’ve been saying. It is futile to move beyond what is written in the Scriptures and be inflated with self-importance by following and promoting one leader in competition with another. 
1CO.4.7	For what makes a distinction between you and someone else? And what do you have that grace has not given you? And if you received it 
1CO.4.8	Oh, I know, you already have all you need! Since when did you become so content and rich without us? You’ve already crowned yourselves as royalty, reigning on your thrones, leaving us 
1CO.4.9	It seems to me that God has appointed us apostles to be at the end of the line. We are like those on display at the end of the procession, as doomed gladiators soon to be killed. We have become a theatrical spectacle to all creation, both to people and to angels. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are the frail; you are the powerful. You are celebrated; we are humiliated. 
1CO.4.11	If you could see us now, you’d find that we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and with no roof over our heads. 
1CO.4.12	We work hard, toiling with our own hands. When people abuse and insult us, we respond with a blessing, and when severely persecuted, we endure it with patience. 
1CO.4.13	When we are slandered incessantly, we always answer gently, ready to reconcile. Even now, in the world’s opinion, we are nothing but filth and the lowest scum.
1CO.4.14	I’m not writing this to embarrass you or to shame you, but to correct you as the children I love. 
1CO.4.15	For although you could have countless babysitters in Christ 
1CO.4.16	So I encourage you, my children, to follow the example that I live before you.
1CO.4.17	That’s why I’ve sent my dear son Timothy, whom I love. He is faithful to the Lord Yahweh and will remind you of how I conduct myself as one who lives in union with Jesus, the Anointed One, and of the teachings that I bring to every church everywhere.
1CO.4.18	There are some among you who have exalted themselves as if I were not coming back to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come soon, if it pleases the Lord, and I will find out not only what these arrogant ones are saying, but also if they have power to back up their words! 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom realm of God comes with power, not simply impressive words. 
1CO.4.21	So which would you prefer? Shall I come carrying the rod of authority to discipline or with an embrace in love with a gentle spirit?
1CO.5.1+1CO.5.2	It’s been widely reported that there is gross sexual immorality among you—the kind of immorality that’s so revolting it’s not even tolerated by the social norms of unbelievers. Are you proud of the fact that one of your men is having sex with his stepmother? Shouldn’t this heartbreaking scandal bring you to your knees in tears? You must remove the offender from among you!
1CO.5.3	Even though I am physically far away from you, my spirit is present with you. And as one who is present with you, I have already evaluated and judged the perpetrator. 
1CO.5.4	So 
1CO.5.5	release this man over to Satan for the destruction of his 
1CO.5.6	Boasting 
1CO.5.7	So remove every trace of your “leaven” of compromise with sin so that you might become new and pure again. For indeed, you are clean because Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us. 
1CO.5.8	So now we can celebrate our continual feast, not with the old “leaven,” the yeast of wickedness or bitterness, but we will feast on the freshly baked bread of innocence and holiness.
1CO.5.9	I wrote you 
1CO.5.10	Yet in no way was I referring to avoiding contact with unbelievers who are immoral, or greedy, or swindlers, or those who worship other gods—for that would mean you’d have to isolate yourself from the world entirely! 
1CO.5.11	But now I’m writing to you so that you would exclude from your fellowship anyone who calls himself a fellow believer and practices sexual immorality, or is consumed with greed, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive or a drunkard or a swindler. Don’t mingle with them or even have a meal with someone like that. 
1CO.5.12+1CO.5.13	What right do I have to pronounce judgment on unbelievers? That’s God’s responsibility. But those who are inside the church family are our responsibility to discern and judge. So it’s your duty to remove that wicked one from among you.
1CO.6.1	Furthermore, how dare you take a fellow believer to court! It is wrong to drag him before the unrighteous to settle a legal dispute. Isn’t it better to take him before God’s holy believers to settle the matter? 
1CO.6.2	Don’t you realize that we, the holy ones, will judge the universe? If the unbelieving world is under your jurisdiction, you should be fully competent to settle these trivial lawsuits among yourselves. 
1CO.6.3	For surely you know that we will one day judge angels, let alone these everyday matters. 
1CO.6.4	Don’t you realize that you are bringing your issues before civil judges appointed by people who have no standing within the church? 
1CO.6.5	What a shame that there is not one within the church who has 
1CO.6.6	 a believer to sue a fellow believer—and especially to bring it before the unbelievers.
1CO.6.7	Don’t you realize that when you drag another believer into court you’re providing the evidence that you are already defeated? Wouldn’t it be better to accept the fact that someone is trying to cheat and take advantage of you, and simply 
1CO.6.8	But instead you keep cheating and doing wrong to your brothers and sisters, 
1CO.6.9	Surely you must know that people who practice evil cannot possess God’s kingdom realm. Stop being deceived! People who continue to engage in sexual immorality, idolatry, adultery, sexual perversion, homosexuality, 
1CO.6.10	fraud, greed, drunkenness, verbal abuse, or extortion—these will not inherit God’s kingdom realm. 
1CO.6.11	It’s true that some of you once lived in those lifestyles, but now you have been purified from sin, made holy, and given a perfect standing before God—all because of the power of the name of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and through our union with the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	It’s true that our freedom allows us to do anything, but that doesn’t mean that everything we do is good for us. I’m free to do as I choose, but I choose to never be enslaved to anything. 
1CO.6.13	Some have said, “I eat to live and I live to eat!” But God will do away with it all. The body was not created for illicit sex, but to serve and worship our Lord Jesus, who can fill the body with himself.
1CO.6.14	Now the God who raised up our Lord from the grave will awaken and raise us up through his mighty power!
1CO.6.15	Don’t you know that your bodies belong to Christ as his body parts? Should one presume to take the members of Christ’s body and make them into members of a harlot? Absolutely not! 
1CO.6.16	Aren’t you aware of the fact that when anyone sleeps with a prostitute he becomes a part of her, and she becomes a part of him? For it has been declared:
1CO.6.16	The two become a single body.
1CO.6.17	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is mingled into one spirit with him. 
1CO.6.18	 you must keep running away from sexual immorality. For every other sin a person commits is external to the body, but immorality involves sinning against your own body.
1CO.6.19	Have you forgotten that your body is now the sacred temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who lives in you? You don’t belong to yourself any longer, for the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, lives inside your sanctuary. 
1CO.6.20	You were God’s expensive purchase, paid for with tears of blood, so by all means, then, use your body to bring glory to God!
1CO.7.1	Now for my response concerning the issues you’ve asked me to address. 
1CO.7.2	Perhaps. But because of the danger of immorality, each husband should have sexual intimacy with his wife and each wife should have sexual intimacy with her husband. 
1CO.7.3	A husband has the responsibility of meeting the sexual needs of his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	Neither the husband nor the wife have exclusive rights to their own bodies, but those rights are to be surrendered to the other. 
1CO.7.5	So don’t continue to refuse your spouse those rights, except perhaps by mutual agreement for a specified time so that you can both be devoted to prayer. And then you should resume your physical pleasure so that the Adversary cannot take advantage of you because of the desires of your body. 
1CO.7.6	I’m not giving you a divine command, but my godly advice. 
1CO.7.7	I would wish that all of you could live 
1CO.7.8	So let me say to the unmarried and those who have lost their spouses, it is fine for you to remain single as I am. 
1CO.7.9	But if you have no power over your passions, then you should go ahead and marry, for marriage is far better than a continual battle with lust.
1CO.7.10	And to those who are married, I give this charge—which is not mine, but the Lord’s—that the wife should not depart from her husband. 
1CO.7.11	But if she does, then she should either remain unmarried or reconcile with her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. 
1CO.7.12	To the rest I say, which is not a saying of the Lord, if a brother has an unbelieving wife and she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by his believing wife. And the unbelieving wife has been made holy by her believing husband 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving spouse wants a divorce, then let it be so. In this situation the believing spouse is not bound 
1CO.7.16	And wives, for all you know you could one day lead your husband to salvation. Or husbands, how do you know for sure that you could not one day lead your wife to salvation?
1CO.7.17	May all believers continue to live the wonderful lives God has called them to live, according to what he assigns for each person, for this is what I teach to believers everywhere. 
1CO.7.18	If when you were called 
1CO.7.19	Your identity 
1CO.7.20	So everyone should continue to live 
1CO.7.21	Were you a slave when you heard the call 
1CO.7.22	For truly, if you are called to a life-union with the Lord, you are already a free man! And those who were called to follow Jesus when they were free are now the Messiah’s slaves. 
1CO.7.23	Since a great price was paid for your redemption, stop having the mind-set of a slave. 
1CO.7.24	Brothers and sisters, we must remain in close communion with God, no matter what our situation was when we were first called to follow Jesus.
1CO.7.25	Now let me address the issue of singleness. I must confess, I have no command to give you that comes directly from the Lord. But let me share my thoughts on the matter, as coming from one who has experienced the mercy of the Lord to keep me faithful to him. 
1CO.7.26	Because of the severe pressure we are in, I recommend you remain as you are. 
1CO.7.27	If you are married, stay in the marriage. If you are single, don’t rush into marriage. 
1CO.7.28	But if you do get married, you haven’t sinned. It’s just that I would want to spare you the problems you’ll face with the extra challenges of being married.
1CO.7.29	My friends, what I mean is this. The urgency of our times mean that from now on, those who have wives should live as though without them. 
1CO.7.30	And those who weep should forget their tears. And those who rejoice will have no time to celebrate. And those who purchase items will have no time to enjoy them. 
1CO.7.31	We are to live as those who live in the world system but are not absorbed by it, for the world as we know it is quickly passing away. 
1CO.7.32	Because of this, we need to live as free from anxiety as possible.
1CO.7.32	For a single man is focused on the things of the Lord and how he may please him. 
1CO.7.33	But a married man is pulled in two directions, for he is concerned about both the things of God and the things of the world in order to please his wife. 
1CO.7.34	And the single woman is focused on the things of the Lord so she can be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world and how she may please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	I am trying to help you and make things easier for you and not make things difficult, but so that you would have undistracted devotion, serving the Lord constantly with an undivided heart.
1CO.7.36	However, if a man has decided to serve God as a single person, yet changes his mind and finds himself in love with a woman, although he never intended to marry, let him go ahead and marry her; it is not a sin to do so. 
1CO.7.37	On the other hand, if a man stands firm in his heart to remain single, and is under no compulsion to get married but has control over his passions and is determined to remain celibate, he has chosen well. 
1CO.7.38	So then, the one who marries his fiancée does well and the one who chooses not to marry her does better.
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound 
1CO.7.40	However, in my opinion (and I think that I too have the Spirit of God), she would be happier if she remained single.
1CO.8.1	Now let me address the issue of food offered in sacrifice to idols. It seems that everyone believes his own opinion is right on this matter. How easily we get puffed up over our opinions! But love builds up the structure 
1CO.8.2	If anyone thinks of himself as a know-it-all, he still has a lot to learn. 
1CO.8.3	But if a person passionately loves God, he will possess the knowledge of God.
1CO.8.4	Concerning food sacrificed as offerings to idols, we all know that an idol is nothing, for there is no God but one. 
1CO.8.5	Although there may be many so-called gods in this world, and in heaven there may be many “gods,” “lords,” and “masters,” 
1CO.8.6	yet for us there is only one God—the Father. Out of him is all things, and our lives are lived for him. And there is one Lord, Jesus, the Anointed One, through whom we and all things exist.
1CO.8.7	But not everyone has this revelation. For some were formerly idolaters, who consider idols as real and living. That’s why they consider the food offered to that “god” as defiled. And their weak consciences become defiled if they eat it. 
1CO.8.8	Yes, we know that what you eat will not bring you closer to God. You are no better if you don’t eat certain foods and no better if you do. 
1CO.8.9	But you must be careful that the liberty you exercise in eating food offered to idols doesn’t offend the weak believers. 
1CO.8.10	For if a believer with a weak conscience sees you, who have a greater understanding, dining in an idol’s temple, won’t this be a temptation to him to violate his own conscience and eat food offered to idols? 
1CO.8.11	So, in effect, by exercising your understanding of freedom, you have ruined this weak believer, a brother for whom Christ has died! 
1CO.8.12	And when you offend weaker believers by wounding their consciences in this way, you also offend the Anointed One!
1CO.8.13	So I conclude that if my eating certain food deeply offends my brother and hinders his advance in Christ, I will never eat it again. I don’t want to be guilty of causing my brother or sister to be wounded and defeated.
1CO.9.1	Am I not completely free and unrestrained? 
1CO.9.2	If others do not recognize me as their apostle, at least you are bound to do so, for now your lives are joined to the Lord. You are the 
1CO.9.3	So to those who want to continually criticize my apostolic ministry, here’s my statement of defense. 
1CO.9.4	Don’t we apostles have the right to be supported financially? 
1CO.9.5	Don’t we have the right to travel accompanied by our believing wives 
1CO.9.6	 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop working for a living?
1CO.9.7	Who serves in the military at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not enjoy the grapes for himself? Who would nurture and shepherd a flock and never get to drink its fresh milk? 
1CO.9.8	Am I merely giving you my own opinions, or does the Torah teach the same things? 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moses:
1CO.9.9	You should never put a muzzle over the mouth of an ox
1CO.9.9	while he is treading out the grain.
1CO.9.9	Tell me, is God only talking about oxen here? 
1CO.9.10	Doesn’t he also give us this principle so that we won’t withhold support from his workers? It was written so that we would understand that the one 
1CO.9.11	So, if we’ve sowed many spiritual gifts among you, is it too much to expect to reap material gifts from you? 
1CO.9.12	And if you have supported others, don’t we rightfully deserve this privilege even more?
1CO.9.12	But as you know, we haven’t used that right. Instead, we have continued to support ourselves so that we would never be a hindrance to the spread of the gospel of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	Don’t you know that the priests employed in sacred duty in the temple are provided for by temple resources? And the priests who serve at the altar receive a portion of the offerings? 
1CO.9.14	In the same way, the Lord has directed those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. As for me, I’ve preferred to never use any of these rights for myself. 
1CO.9.15	And keep in mind that I’m not writing all this because I’m hinting that you should support me.
1CO.9.15	Actually, I’d rather die than to have anyone rob me of this joyous reason for boasting! 
1CO.9.16	For you see, even though I proclaim the good news, I can’t take the credit for my labors, for I am compelled to fulfill my duty by completing this work. It would be agony to me if I did not constantly preach the gospel! 
1CO.9.17	If it were my own idea to preach as a way to make a living, I would expect to be paid. Since it’s not my idea but God’s, who commissioned me, I am entrusted with the stewardship of the gospel 
1CO.9.18	So then, where is my reward? It is found in continually depositing the good news 
1CO.9.19	Now, even though I am free from obligations to others, I 
1CO.9.20	I became Jewish to the Jewish people in order to win them 
1CO.9.21	And to those who are without the Jewish laws, I became like them, as one without the Jewish laws, in order to win them, although I’m not outside the law of God but under the law of Christ. 
1CO.9.22	I became “weak” to the weak to win the weak. I have adapted to the culture of every place I’ve gone so that I could more easily win people to Christ. 
1CO.9.23	I’ve done all this so that I would become God’s partner for the sake of the gospel.
1CO.9.24	Isn’t it obvious that all runners on the racetrack keep on running to win, but only one receives the victor’s prize? Yet each one of you must run the race to be victorious. 
1CO.9.25	A true athlete will be disciplined in every respect, practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel wreath that quickly withers. But we run our race to win a victor’s crown that will last forever. 
1CO.9.26	For that reason, I don’t run just for exercise or box like one throwing aimless punches, 
1CO.9.27	but I train like a champion athlete. I subdue my body and get it under my control, so that after preaching the good news to others I myself won’t be disqualified.
1CO.10.1	My dear fellow believers, you need to understand that all of our Jewish ancestors 
1CO.10.2	They were all baptized into the cloud of glory, into the fellowship of Moses, and into the sea. 
1CO.10.3	They all ate the same heavenly manna 
1CO.10.4	and drank water from the same spiritual rock that traveled with them—and that Rock was Christ himself. 
1CO.10.5	Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their dead bodies were scattered around the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now, all these things serve as types and pictures for us—lessons that teach us not to fail in the same way by callously craving worthless things 
1CO.10.7	and practicing idolatry, as some of them did. For it is written:
1CO.10.7	The people settled in to their unrestrained revelry, with feasting and drinking, then they rose up and became wildly out of control!
1CO.10.8	Neither should we commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, which caused the death of twenty-three thousand on a single day. 
1CO.10.9	Nor should we ever provoke the Lord, as some of them did by putting him to outrageous tests that resulted in their death from snakebites day after day. 
1CO.10.10	And we must not embrace their ways by complaining—grumbling with discontent, as many of them did, and were killed by the destroyer!
1CO.10.11	All the tests they endured on their way through the wilderness are a symbolic picture, an example that provides us with a warning so that we can learn through what they experienced. For we live in a time when the purpose of all the ages past is now completing its goal within us. 
1CO.10.12	So beware if you think it could never happen to you, lest your pride becomes your downfall.
1CO.10.13	We all experience times of testing, which is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He will screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial you face so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust him more, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape that will bring you out of it victoriously.
1CO.10.14	My cherished friends, keep on running far away from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I know I am writing to thoughtful people, so carefully consider what I say. 
1CO.10.16	For when we pray for the blessing of the communion cup, isn’t this our co-participation with the blood of Jesus? And the bread that we distribute, isn’t this the bread of our co-participation with the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	For although we’re many, we become one loaf of bread and one body as we feast together on one loaf.
1CO.10.18	Consider the people of Israel 
1CO.10.19	Now, am I saying that idols and the sacrifices offered to them have any value? 
1CO.10.20	Absolutely not! However, I am implying that when an unbeliever offers a sacrifice to an idol, it is not offered to the true God but to a demon. I don’t want you to be participants with demons! 
1CO.10.21	You can’t drink from the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t feast at the table of the Lord and feast at the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Who would ever want to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Is that something you think you’re strong enough to endure?
1CO.10.23	, “
1CO.10.24	So don’t always seek what is best for you at the expense of another. 
1CO.10.25	Yes, you are free to eat anything without worrying about your conscience, 
1CO.10.26	for the earth and all its abundance belongs to the Lord.
1CO.10.27	So if an unbeliever invites you to dinner, go ahead and eat whatever is served, without asking questions concerning where it came from. 
1CO.10.28	But if he goes out of his way to inform you that the meat was actually an offering sacrificed to idols, then you should pass, not only for his sake but because of his conscience. 
1CO.10.29	I’m talking about someone else’s conscience, not yours. What good is there in doing what you please if it’s condemned by someone else?
1CO.10.30	So if I voluntarily participate, why should I be judged for celebrating my freedom? 
1CO.10.31	Whether you eat or drink, live your life in a way that glorifies and honors God. 
1CO.10.32	And make sure you’re not offending Jews or Greeks or any part of God’s assembly 
1CO.10.33	, for I try to please everyone in all things, rather than putting my liberty first. I sincerely attempt to do anything I can so that others may be saved.
1CO.11.1	I want you to pattern your lives after me, just as I pattern mine after Christ. 
1CO.11.2	And I give you full credit for always keeping me in mind as you follow carefully the substance of my instructions that I’ve taught you. 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to understand that Christ is the source of every human alive, and Adam was the source of Eve, and God is the source of the Messiah.
1CO.11.4	Any man 
1CO.11.5	And if any woman 
1CO.11.6	If a woman who wants to be in leadership will not conform to the customs of what is proper for women, she might as well cut off her hair. But if it’s disgraceful for her to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.
1CO.11.7	A man 
1CO.11.8	for man was not created from woman but woman from man. 
1CO.11.9	By the same token, the man was not created because the woman needed him; the woman was created because the man needed her. 
1CO.11.10	For this reason she should have authority over the head because of the angels.
1CO.11.11	So then, I have to insist that in the Lord, neither is woman inferior to man nor is man inferior to woman. 
1CO.11.12	For just as woman was taken from the side of man, in the same way man is taken from the 
1CO.11.13	So then you can decide for yourselves—is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her hair unbound? 
1CO.11.14	Doesn’t our long-established cultural tradition teach us that if a man has long hair that is 
1CO.11.15	This is because long hair is the endowment that God has given her as a head covering.
1CO.11.16	If someone wants to quarrel about this, I want you to know that we have no intention to start an argument, neither I nor the congregations of God.
1CO.11.17	Now, on this next matter, I wish I could commend you, but I cannot, because when you meet together as a church family it is doing more harm than good! 
1CO.11.18	I’ve been told many times that when you meet as a congregation, divisions and cliques emerge—and to some extent, this doesn’t surprise me. 
1CO.11.19	Differences of opinion are unavoidable, yet they will reveal which ones among you truly have God’s approval.
1CO.11.20	When all of 
1CO.11.21	For when it comes time to eat, some gobble down their food before anything is given to others—one is left hungry while others become drunk! 
1CO.11.22	Don’t you all have homes where you can eat and drink? Don’t you realize that you’re showing a superior attitude by humiliating those who have nothing? Are you trying to show contempt for God’s beloved church? How should I address this appropriately? If you’re looking for my approval, you won’t find it!
1CO.11.23	I have handed down to you what came to me by direct revelation from the Lord himself. The same night in which he was handed over, he took bread 
1CO.11.24	and gave thanks. Then he distributed it to the disciples and said, 
1CO.11.25	He did the same with the cup 
1CO.11.26	Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are retelling the story, proclaiming our Lord’s death until he comes. 
1CO.11.27	For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit will be guilty of dishonoring the body and blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	So let each individual first evaluate his own attitude and only then eat the bread and drink the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For continually eating and drinking with a wrong spirit will bring judgment upon yourself by not recognizing the body. 
1CO.11.30	This insensitivity is why many of you are weak, chronically ill, and some even dying. 
1CO.11.31	If you do not sit in judgment of others, you will avoid judgment yourself. 
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, it is the Lord’s training so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
1CO.11.33	So then, my fellow believers, when you assemble as one to share a meal, show respect for one another and wait for all to be served. 
1CO.11.34	If you are that hungry, eat at home first, so that when you gather together you will not bring judgment upon yourself.
1CO.11.34	When I come to you, I will answer the other questions you asked me 
1CO.12.1	My fellow believers, I don’t want you to be confused about spiritual realities. 
1CO.12.2	For you know full well that when you were unbelievers you were often led astray in one way or another by your worship of idols, which are incapable of talking with you. 
1CO.12.3	Therefore, I want to impart to you an understanding of the following:
1CO.12.3	No one speaking by the Spirit of God would ever say, “Jesus is the accursed one.”
1CO.12.3	No one can say, “Jesus is the Lord Yahweh,” unless the Holy Spirit is speaking through him.
1CO.12.4	It is the same Holy Spirit who continues to distribute many different varieties of gifts.
1CO.12.5	The Lord Yahweh is one, and he is the one who apportions to believers different varieties of ministries.
1CO.12.6	The same God distributes different kinds of miracles that accomplish different results through each believer’s gift and ministry as he energizes and activates them.
1CO.12.7	Each believer is given continuous revelation by the Holy Spirit to benefit not just himself but all.
1CO.12.8	For example:
1CO.12.8	The Spirit gives to one the gift of the word of wisdom.
1CO.12.8	To another, the same Spirit gives the gift of the word of revelation knowledge.
1CO.12.9	And to another, the same Spirit gives the gift of faith.
1CO.12.9	And to another, the same Spirit gives gifts of healing.
1CO.12.10	And to another the power to work miracles.
1CO.12.10	And to another the gift of prophecy.
1CO.12.10	And to another the gift to discern what the Spirit is speaking.
1CO.12.10	And to another the gift of speaking different kinds of tongues.
1CO.12.10	And to another the gift of interpretation of tongues.
1CO.12.11	Remember, it is the same Holy Spirit who distributes, activates, and operates these different gifts as he chooses for each believer.
1CO.12.12	Just as the human body is one, though it has many parts that together form one body, so too is Christ. 
1CO.12.13	For by one Spirit we all were immersed and mingled into one single body. And no matter our status—whether we are Jews or non-Jews, oppressed or free—we are all privileged to drink deeply of the same Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.14	In fact, the human body is not one single part but rather many parts 
1CO.12.15	So if the foot were to say, “Since I’m not a hand, I’m not a part of the body,” it’s forgetting that it is still a vital part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear were to say, “Since I’m not an eye, I’m not really a part of the body,” it’s forgetting that it is still an important part of the body.
1CO.12.17	 If the whole body were just an eyeball, how could it hear sounds? And if the whole body were just an ear, how could it smell different fragrances? 
1CO.12.18	But God has carefully designed each member and placed it in the body to function as he desires. 
1CO.12.19	, for if the body consisted of one single part, there wouldn’t be a body at all! 
1CO.12.20	So now we see that there are many differing parts and functions, but one body.
1CO.12.21	It would be wrong for the eye to say to the hand, “I don’t need you,” and equally wrong if the head said to the foot, “I don’t need you.” 
1CO.12.22	In fact, the weaker our parts, the more vital and essential they are. 
1CO.12.23	The body parts we think are less honorable we treat with greater respect. And the body parts that need to be covered in public we treat with propriety and clothe them. 
1CO.12.24	But some of our body parts don’t require as much attention. Instead, God has mingled the body parts together, giving greater honor to the “lesser” members who lacked it. 
1CO.12.25	 so that every member would look after the others with mutual concern, and so that there will be no division in the body. 
1CO.12.26	In that way, whatever happens to one member happens to all. If one suffers, everyone suffers. If one is honored, everyone rejoices.
1CO.12.27	You are the body of the Anointed One, and each of you is a unique and vital part of it. 
1CO.12.28	God has placed in the church the following:
1CO.12.28	First apostles,
1CO.12.28	second prophets,
1CO.12.28	third teachers,
1CO.12.28	then those with gifts of miracles, gifts of divine healing,
1CO.12.28	gifts of revelation knowledge, gifts of leadership,
1CO.12.28	and gifts of different kinds of tongues.
1CO.12.29	Not everyone is an apostle or a prophet or a teacher. Not everyone performs miracles 
1CO.12.30	or has gifts of healing or speaks in tongues or interprets tongues. 
1CO.12.31	But you should all constantly boil over with passion in seeking the higher gifts.
1CO.12.31	And now I will show you a superior way to live that is beyond comparison!
1CO.13.1	If I were to speak with eloquence in earth’s many languages, and in the heavenly tongues of angels, yet I didn’t express myself with love, my words would be reduced to the hollow sound of nothing more than a clanging cymbal.
1CO.13.2	And if I were to have 
1CO.13.3	And if I were to be so generous as to give away everything I owned to feed the poor, and to offer my body to be burned 
1CO.13.4	Love is 
1CO.13.5	Love does not traffic in shame and disrespect, nor selfishly seek its own honor. Love is not easily irritated or quick to take offense. 
1CO.13.6	Love joyfully celebrates honesty and finds no delight in what is wrong. 
1CO.13.7	Love is a safe place of shelter, for it never stops believing the best for others. Love never takes failure as defeat, for it never gives up.
1CO.13.8	Love never stops loving. It extends beyond the gift of prophecy, which eventually fades away. It is more enduring than tongues, which will one day fall silent. Love remains long after 
1CO.13.9	Our present knowledge and our prophecies are but partial, 
1CO.13.10	but when love’s perfection arrives, the partial will fade away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke about childish matters, for I saw things like a child and reasoned like a child. But the day came when I matured, and I set aside my childish ways.
1CO.13.12	For now we see but a faint reflection of riddles and mysteries as though reflected in a mirror, but one day we will see face-to-face. My understanding is incomplete now, but one day I will understand everything, just as everything about me has been fully understood. 
1CO.13.13	Until then, there are three things that remain: faith, hope, and love—yet love surpasses them all. So above all else, let love be the beautiful prize for which you run.
1CO.14.1	It is good that you are enthusiastic and passionate about spiritual gifts, especially prophecy. 
1CO.14.2	When someone speaks in tongues, no one understands a word he says, because he’s not speaking to people, but to God—he is speaking intimate mysteries in the Spirit. 
1CO.14.3	But when someone prophesies, he speaks to encourage people, to build them up, and to bring them comfort. 
1CO.14.4	The one who speaks in tongues advances his own spiritual progress, while the one who prophesies builds up the church. 
1CO.14.5	I would be delighted if you all spoke in tongues, but I desire even more that you impart prophetic revelation to others. Greater gain comes through the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless there is interpretation so that it builds up the entire church.
1CO.14.6	My dear friends, what good is it if I come to you always speaking in tongues? But if I come with a clear revelation from God, or with insight, or with a prophecy, or with a clear teaching, 
1CO.14.7	Similarly, if musical instruments, such as flutes or stringed instruments, are out of tune and don’t play the arrangement clearly, how will anyone recognize the melody? 
1CO.14.8	If the bugle makes a garbled sound, who will recognize the signal to show up for the battle? 
1CO.14.9	So it is with you. Unless you speak in a language that’s easily understood, how will anyone know what you’re talking about? You might as well save your breath!
1CO.14.10	I suppose that the world has all sorts of languages, and each conveys meaning to the ones who speak it. 
1CO.14.11	But I am like a foreigner if I don’t understand the language, and the speaker will be like a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	And that’s what’s happening among you. You are so passionate about embracing the manifestations of the Holy Spirit! Now become even more passionate about the things that strengthen the entire church.
1CO.14.13	So then, if you speak in a tongue, pray for the interpretation to be able to unfold the meaning of what you are saying. 
1CO.14.14	For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit is engaged in prayer but I have no clear understanding of what is being said.
1CO.14.15	So here’s what I’ve concluded. I will pray in the Spirit, but I will also pray with my mind engaged. I will sing rapturous praises in the Spirit, but I will also sing with my mind engaged. 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise, if you are praising God in your spirit, how could someone without the gift participate by adding his “amen” to your giving of thanks, since he doesn’t have a clue of what you’re saying? 
1CO.14.17	Your praise to God is admirable, but it does nothing to strengthen and build up others.
1CO.14.18	I give thanks to God that I speak in tongues more than all of you, 
1CO.14.19	but in the church setting I would rather speak five words that can be understood than ten thousand exotic words in a tongue. That way I could have a role in teaching others.
1CO.14.20	Beloved ones, don’t remain as immature children in your reasoning. As it relates to evil, be like newborns, but in your thinking be mature adults.
1CO.14.21	For it stands written in the law:
1CO.14.21	I will bring my message to this people with strange tongues and foreign lips, yet even then they still will not listen to me, says the Lord.
1CO.14.22	So then, tongues are not a sign for believers, but a miracle for unbelievers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is not for unbelievers, but a miracle sign for believers.
1CO.14.23	If the entire church comes together and everyone is speaking in tongues, won’t the visitors say that you have lost your minds? 
1CO.14.24	But if everyone is prophesying, and an unbeliever or one without the gift enters your meeting, he will be convicted by all that he hears and will be called to account, 
1CO.14.25	for the intimate secrets of his heart will be brought to light. He will be mystified and fall facedown in worship and say, “God is truly among you!”
1CO.14.26	Beloved friends, what does all this imply? When you conduct your meetings, you should always let everything be done to build up the church family. Whether you share a song of praise, a teaching, a divine revelation, or a tongue and interpretation, let each one contribute what strengthens others.
1CO.14.27	If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two or three, one after another, with someone interpreting. 
1CO.14.28	If there’s no one with the interpretation, then he should remain silent in the meeting, content to speak to himself and to God.
1CO.14.29	 Let two or three prophets prophesy and let the other prophets carefully evaluate and discern what is being said. 
1CO.14.30	But if someone receives a revelation while someone else is still speaking, the one speaking should conclude 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy in turn and in an environment where all present can be instructed, encouraged, and strengthened. 
1CO.14.32	Keep in mind that the anointing to prophesy doesn’t mean that the speaker is out of control—he can wait his turn. 
1CO.14.33	For God is the God of harmony, not confusion, as is the pattern in all the churches of God’s holy believers.
1CO.14.34	The women should be respectfully silent 
1CO.14.35	If they want to inquire about something, let them ask their husbands when they get home, for a woman embarrasses herself when she constantly interrupts the church meeting.
1CO.14.36	Do you actually think that you were the starting point for the Word of God going forth? Were you the only ones it was sent to? 
1CO.14.37	If anyone considers himself to be a prophet or a spiritual person, let him discern that what I’m writing to you carries the Lord’s authority. 
1CO.14.38	And if anyone continues not to recognize this, he should not be recognized!
1CO.14.39	So, beloved friends, with all this in mind, be passionate to prophesy and don’t forbid anyone from speaking in tongues, 
1CO.14.40	doing all things in a beautiful and orderly way.
1CO.15.1	Dear friends, let me give you clearly the heart of the gospel that I’ve preached to you—the good news that you have heartily received and on which you stand. 
1CO.15.2	For it is through the revelation of the gospel that you are being saved, if you fasten your life firmly to the message I’ve taught you, unless you have believed in vain. 
1CO.15.3	For I have shared with you what I have received and what is of utmost importance:
1CO.15.3	The Messiah died for our sins,
1CO.15.3	fulfilling the prophecies of the Scriptures.
1CO.15.4	He was buried in a tomb
1CO.15.4	and was raised from the dead after three days,
1CO.15.4	as foretold in the Scriptures.
1CO.15.5	Then he appeared to Peter the Rock
1CO.15.5	and to the twelve apostles.
1CO.15.6	He also appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at the same time, most of whom are still alive as I write this, though a few have passed away. 
1CO.15.7	Then he appeared to Jacob and to all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	Last of all he appeared in front of me, like one born prematurely, ripped from the womb. 
1CO.15.9	Yes, I am the most insignificant of all the apostles, unworthy even to be called an apostle, because I hunted down believers and persecuted God’s church. 
1CO.15.10	But God’s amazing grace has made me who I am! And his grace to me was not fruitless. In fact, I worked harder than all the rest, yet not in my own strength but God’s, for his empowering grace is poured out upon me. 
1CO.15.11	So this is what we all have taught you, and whether it was through me or someone else, you have now believed the gospel.
1CO.15.12	The message we preach is Christ, who has been raised from the dead. So how could any of you possibly say there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	For if there is no such thing as a resurrection from the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
1CO.15.14	And if Christ has not been raised, all of our preaching has been for nothing and your faith is useless. 
1CO.15.15	Moreover, if the dead are not raised, that would mean that we are false witnesses who are misrepresenting God. And that would mean that we have preached a lie, stating that God raised him from the dead, if in reality he didn’t.
1CO.15.16	If the dead aren’t raised up, that would mean that Christ has not been raised up either. 
1CO.15.17	And if Christ is not alive, you are still lost in your sins and your faith is a fantasy. 
1CO.15.18	It would also mean that those believers in Christ who have passed away have simply perished. 
1CO.15.19	If the only benefit of our hope in Christ is limited to this life on earth, we deserve to be pitied more than all others!
1CO.15.20	But the truth is, Christ is risen from the dead, as the firstfruit of a great resurrection harvest of those who have died. 
1CO.15.21	For since death came through a man, 
1CO.15.22	Even as all who are in Adam die, so also all who are in Christ will be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But each one in his proper order: Christ, the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ in his presence.
1CO.15.24	Then the final stage of completion comes, when he will bring to an end every other rulership, authority, and power, and he will hand over his kingdom to Father God. 
1CO.15.25	Until then he is destined to reign 
1CO.15.26	And the last enemy to be subdued and eliminated is death itself.
1CO.15.27	The Father has placed all things in subjection under the feet of Christ. Yet when it says, “all things,” it is understood that the Father does not include himself, for he is the one who placed all things in subjection to Christ. 
1CO.15.28	However, when everything is subdued and in submission to him, then the Son himself will be subject to the Father, who put all things under his feet. This is so that Father God will be everything in everyone!
1CO.15.29	If there is no resurrection, what do these people think they’re doing when they are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised, why be baptized for them? 
1CO.15.30	And why would we be risking our lives every day?
1CO.15.31	My brothers and sisters, I continually face death. This is as sure as my boasting of you and our co-union together in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives me confidence to share my experiences with you. 
1CO.15.32	Tell me, why did I fight “wild beasts” in Ephesus if my hope is in this life only? What was the point of that? If the dead do not rise, then
1CO.15.32	Let’s party all night, for tomorrow we die!
1CO.15.33	So stop fooling yourselves! Evil companions will corrupt good morals and character. 
1CO.15.34	Come back to your right senses and awaken to what is right. Repent from your sinful ways. For some have no knowledge of God’s wonderful love. You should be ashamed that you make me write this way to you!
1CO.15.35	I can almost hear someone saying, “How can the dead come back to life? And what kind of body will they have when they are resurrected?” 
1CO.15.36	Foolish man! Don’t you know that what you sow in the ground doesn’t germinate unless it dies? 
1CO.15.37	And what you sow is not the body that will come into being, but the bare seed. And it’s hard to tell whether it’s wheat or some other seed. 
1CO.15.38	But when it dies, God gives it a new form, a body to fulfill his purpose, and he sees to it that each seed gets a new body of its own 
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not identical. Animals have one flesh and human beings another. Birds have their distinct flesh and fish another. 
1CO.15.40	In the same way there are earthly bodies and heavenly bodies. There is a splendor of the celestial body and a different one for the earthly. 
1CO.15.41	There is the radiance of the sun and differing radiance for the moon and for the stars. Even the stars differ in their shining. 
1CO.15.42	And that’s how it will be with the resurrection of the dead.
1CO.15.43	The body is “sown” in decay, but will be raised in immortality. It is “sown” in humiliation, but will be raised in glorification. 
1CO.15.44	It is “sown” in weakness but will be raised in power. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	For it is written:
1CO.15.45	The first man, Adam, became a living soul.
1CO.15.45	The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. 
1CO.15.46	However, the spiritual didn’t come first. The natural precedes the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man was from the dust of the earth; the second Man is the Lord Jehovah, from the realm of heaven. 
1CO.15.48	The first one, made from dust, has a race of people just like him, who are also made from dust. The One sent from heaven has a race of heavenly people who are just like him. 
1CO.15.49	Once we carried the likeness of the man of dust, but now let us carry the likeness of the Man of heaven.
1CO.15.50	Now, I tell you this, my brothers and sisters, flesh and blood are not able to inherit God’s kingdom realm, and neither will that which is decaying be able to inherit what is incorruptible.
1CO.15.51	Listen, and I will tell you a divine mystery: not all of us will die, but we will all be transformed. 
1CO.15.52	It will happen in an instant—in the twinkling of his eye. For when the last trumpet is sounded, the dead will come back to life. We will be indestructible and we will be transformed. 
1CO.15.53	For we will discard our mortal “clothes” and slip into a body that is imperishable. What is mortal now will be exchanged for immortality. 
1CO.15.54	And when that which is mortal puts on immortality, and what now decays is exchanged for what will never decay, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says:
1CO.15.54	Death is swallowed up by a triumphant victory!
1CO.15.55	So death, tell me, where is your victory?
1CO.15.55	Tell me death, where is your sting?
1CO.15.56	It is sin that gives death its sting and the law that gives sin its power. 
1CO.15.57	But we thank God for giving us the victory as conquerors through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. 
1CO.15.58	So now, beloved ones, stand firm, stable, and enduring. Live your lives with an unshakable confidence. We know that we prosper and excel in every season by serving the Lord, because we are assured that our union with the Lord makes our labor productive with fruit that endures.
1CO.16.1	Now, concerning the collection I want you to take for God’s holy believers 
1CO.16.2	Every Sunday, each of you make a generous offering by taking a portion of whatever God has blessed you with and place it in safekeeping. Then I won’t have to make a special appeal when I come. 
1CO.16.3	When I arrive, I will send your gift to the poor in Jerusalem along with a letter of explanation, carried by those whom you approve. 
1CO.16.4	If it seems advisable for me to accompany them, I’ll be glad to have them travel with me.
1CO.16.5	I plan to be traveling through Macedonia, and afterward I will visit you 
1CO.16.6	and perhaps stay there for a while, or even spend the winter with you. Afterward you can send me on my journey, wherever I go next, with your financial support. 
1CO.16.7	For it’s not my desire to just see you in passing, but I would like to spend some time with you if the Lord permits. 
1CO.16.8	Regardless, I will remain in Ephesus until 
1CO.16.9	There’s an amazing door of opportunity standing wide open for me to minister here, even though there are many who oppose and stand against me.
1CO.16.10	When Timothy arrives, make sure that he feels at home while he’s with you, for he’s advancing the Lord’s work just as I am. 
1CO.16.11	Don’t let anyone disparage or look down on him, but kindly help him on his way with financial support so that he may come back to me, for I am waiting for him and the brothers to return.
1CO.16.12	Now, about our brother Apollos. I’ve tried hard to convince him to come visit you with the other brothers, but it’s simply not the right time for him now. But 
1CO.16.13	Remember to stay alert and hold firmly to all that you believe. Be mighty and full of courage. 
1CO.16.14	Let love and kindness be the motivation behind all that you do. 
1CO.16.15	Dear brothers and sisters, I have a request to make of you. Give special recognition to Stephanas and his family, for they were the first converts in Achaia, and they have fully devoted themselves to serve God’s holy people. 
1CO.16.16	I urge you to honor and support them, and all those like them who work so diligently for the Lord.
1CO.16.17	I was delighted when Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus arrived, for they’ve made up for your absence. 
1CO.16.18	They have refreshed my spirit in the same way they’ve refreshed yours. Be sure to honor people like this.
1CO.16.19	All the churches of western Turkey send their loving greetings to you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord with those of their house church. 
1CO.16.20	All of your fellow believers 
1CO.16.21	In my own handwriting, I, Paul, add my loving greeting.
1CO.16.22	If anyone doesn’t sincerely love the Lord, he deserves to be doomed as an outcast. Our Lord has come! 
1CO.16.23	May the grace and favor of our Lord Jesus be with you. 
1CO.16.24	I send my love to all who are joined in the life of Jesus, the Anointed One.
2CO.1.1	From Paul to God’s called ones, his church in Corinth.
2CO.1.1	I have been chosen by Jesus Christ to be his apostle according to God’s perfect plan. Our brother Timothy joins me in writing to you and all the holy believers throughout the Roman province of Achaia. 
2CO.1.2	May undeserved favor and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!
2CO.1.3	All praises belong to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he is the Father of tender mercy and the God of endless comfort. 
2CO.1.4	He always comes alongside us to comfort us in every suffering so that we can come alongside those who are in any painful trial. We can bring them this same comfort that God has poured out upon us. 
2CO.1.5	And just as we experience the abundance of Christ’s own sufferings, even more of God’s comfort will cascade upon us through our union with Christ.
2CO.1.6	If troubles weigh us down, that just means that we will receive even more comfort to pass on to you for your deliverance! For the comfort pouring into us empowers us to bring comfort to you. And with this comfort upholding you, you can endure 
2CO.1.7	Now our hope for you is unshakable, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings you will also share in God’s comforting strength.
2CO.1.8	Brothers and sisters, you need to know about the severe trials we experienced while we were in western Turkey. All of the hardships we passed through crushed us beyond our ability to endure, and we were so completely overwhelmed that we were about to give up entirely. 
2CO.1.9	It felt like we had a death sentence written upon our hearts, 
2CO.1.10	He has rescued us from terrifying encounters with death. And now we fasten our hopes on him to continue to deliver us from death yet again, 
2CO.1.11	as you labor together with us through prayer. 
2CO.1.12	We rejoice in saying with complete honesty and a clear conscience that God has empowered us to conduct ourselves in a holy manner and with no hidden agenda. God’s marvelous grace enables us to minister to everyone with pure motives, not in the clever wisdom of the world. This is especially true in all of our dealings with you. 
2CO.1.13	We write to you with words that are clearly understood, and there is no need for you to try to read between the lines of what we write in hopes that you can completely and accurately understand 
2CO.1.14	We know you have already understood us in a measure and that you will eventually come to understand us fully. Then you’ll be able to boast of us even as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15+2CO.1.16	With this confidence, I’m wanting to visit you before and after my trip 
2CO.1.17	When I revised my itinerary, was I vacillating? Or do I make my plans with unprincipled motives, ready to flip-flop with a “yes” and a “no” in the same breath? 
2CO.1.18	For as God is true to his word, my promise to you was not a 
2CO.1.19	Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and he is the one whom Timothy, Silas, and I have preached to you—and he has never been both a “yes” and a “no.” He has always been and always will be for us a resounding “YES!” 
2CO.1.20	For all of God’s promises find their “yes” of fulfillment in him. And as his “yes” and our “amen” ascend to God, we bring him glory!
2CO.1.21	Now, it is God himself who has anointed us. And he is constantly strengthening both you and us in union with Christ. 
2CO.1.22	 since he has also stamped his seal of love over our hearts and has given us the Holy Spirit like an engagement ring is given to a bride—a down payment of the blessings to come!
2CO.1.23	Now, I call upon this faithful God as a witness against me 
2CO.1.24	But I don’t want to imply that 
2CO.2.1	So 
2CO.2.2	For if I brought you pain, you would be unable to bring me joy. 
2CO.2.3	And this was the very point I made in my letter, for I didn’t want to come and find sadness filling the very ones who should give me cheer. But I’m confident 
2CO.2.4	I wrote you previously sobbing and with a broken heart. I was filled with anguish and deep distress. I had no intention of causing you pain but to convey the overwhelming measure of my love for you. 
2CO.2.5	For the one who has caused me grief has not only grieved me but, to some extent, has caused you all grief as well. 
2CO.2.6	I believe that your united rebuke has been punishment enough for him. 
2CO.2.7	Instead of more punishment, what he needs most is your encouragement through your gracious display of forgiveness. 
2CO.2.8	I beg you to reaffirm your deep love for him.
2CO.2.9	You see, I wrote previously in order to see if your hearts would pass the test and if you were willing to follow my counsel in everything. 
2CO.2.10	If you freely forgive anyone for anything, then I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I did so for you before the face of Christ, 
2CO.2.11	so that we would not be exploited by the adversary, Satan, for we know his clever schemes.
2CO.2.12	When I arrived at Troas, bringing the wonderful news of Christ, the Lord opened a great door of opportunity to minister there. 
2CO.2.13	Still, I had no peace of mind, because I couldn’t find my dear brother Titus anywhere. So after saying goodbye to the believers, I set out for Macedonia to look for him.
2CO.2.14	God always makes his grace visible in Christ, who includes us as partners of his endless triumph. Through our yielded lives he spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere we go. 
2CO.2.15	We have become the unmistakable aroma 
2CO.2.16	The unbelievers smell a deadly stench that leads to death, but believers smell the life-giving aroma that leads to abundant life. And who of us can rise to this challenge? 
2CO.2.17	For unlike so many, we are not peddlers of God’s Word who water down the message. We are those sent from God with pure motives, who speak in the sight of God from our union with Christ.
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning to sound like those who speak highly of themselves? Do you really need letters of recommendation 
2CO.3.2	For your very lives are our “letters of recommendation,” permanently engraved on our hearts, recognized and read by everybody. 
2CO.3.3	As a result of our ministry, you are living letters written by Christ, not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God—not carved onto stone tablets but on the tablets of tender hearts. 
2CO.3.4	We carry this confidence in our hearts because of our union with Christ before God. 
2CO.3.5	Yet we don’t see ourselves as capable enough to do anything in our own strength, for our true competence flows from God’s 
2CO.3.6	He alone makes us adequate ministers who are focused on an entirely new covenant. Our ministry is not based on the letter of the law but through the 
2CO.3.7	Even the ministry that was characterized by chiseled letters on stone tablets came with a dazzling measure of glory, though it produced death. The Israelites couldn’t bear to gaze on the glowing face of Moses because of the radiant splendor shining from his countenance—a glory destined to fade away.
2CO.3.8	Yet how much more radiant is this new and glorious ministry of the Spirit 
2CO.3.9	For if the former ministry of condemnation was ushered in with a measure of glory, how much more does the ministry that imparts righteousness far excel in glory. 
2CO.3.10	What once was glorious no longer holds any glory because of the increasingly greater glory that has replaced it. 
2CO.3.11	The fading ministry came with a portion of glory, but now we embrace the unfading ministry of a permanent impartation of glory. 
2CO.3.12	So then, with this amazing hope living in us, we step out in freedom and boldness to speak the truth.
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses, who used a veil to hide the glory to keep the Israelites from staring at him as it faded away. 
2CO.3.14	Their minds were closed and hardened, for even to this day that same veil comes over their minds when they hear the words of the former covenant. The veil has not yet been lifted from them, for it is only eliminated when one is joined to the Messiah. 
2CO.3.15	So until now, whenever the Old Testament is being read, the same blinding comes over their hearts. 
2CO.3.16	But the moment one turns to the Lord with an open heart, the veil is lifted 
2CO.3.17	Now, the “Lord” 
2CO.3.18	We can all draw close to him with the veil removed from our faces. And with no veil we all become like mirrors who brightly reflect the glory of the Lord 
2CO.4.1	Now, it’s because of God’s mercy that we have been entrusted with the privilege of this 
2CO.4.2	We reject every shameful cover-up and refuse to resort to cunning trickery or distorting the Word of God. Instead, we open up our souls to you by presenting the truth to everyone’s conscience in the sight and presence of God. 
2CO.4.3	Even if our gospel message is veiled, it is only veiled to those who are perishing, 
2CO.4.4	for their minds have been blinded by the god of this age, leaving them in unbelief. Their blindness keeps them from seeing the dayspring light of the wonderful news of the glory of Jesus Christ, who is the 
2CO.4.5	We don’t preach ourselves, but rather the lordship of Jesus Christ, for we are your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
2CO.4.6	For God, who said,
2CO.4.6	“Let brilliant light shine out of darkness,”
2CO.4.6	is the one who has cascaded his light into us—the brilliant dawning light of the glorious knowledge of God as we gaze into the face of Jesus Christ.
2CO.4.7	We are like common clay jars that carry this glorious treasure within, so that the extraordinary overflow of power will be seen as God’s, not ours. 
2CO.4.8	Though we experience every kind of pressure, we’re not crushed. At times we don’t know what to do, but quitting is not an option. 
2CO.4.9	We are persecuted by others, but God has not forsaken us. We may be knocked down, but not out. 
2CO.4.10	We continually share in the death of Jesus in our own bodies so that the resurrection life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity. 
2CO.4.11	We consider living to mean that we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake so that the life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity. 
2CO.4.12	So, then, death is at work in us but it releases life in you.
2CO.4.13	We have the same Spirit of faith that is described in the Scriptures when it says,
2CO.4.13	“First I believed, then I spoke in faith.”
2CO.4.13	So we also first believe then speak in faith. 
2CO.4.14	We do this because we are convinced that he who raised Jesus will raise us up with him, and together we will all be brought into his presence. 
2CO.4.15	Yes, all things work for your enrichment so that more of God’s marvelous grace will spread to more and more people, resulting in an even greater increase of praise to God, bringing him even more glory!
2CO.4.16	So no wonder we don’t give up. For even though our outer person gradually wears out, our inner being is renewed every single day. 
2CO.4.17	We view our slight, short-lived troubles in the light of eternity. We see our difficulties as the substance that produces for us an eternal, weighty glory far beyond all comparison, 
2CO.4.18	because we don’t focus our attention on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but the unseen realm is eternal.
2CO.5.1	We are convinced that even if these bodies we live in are folded up at death like tents, we will still have a God-built home that no human hands have built, which will last forever in the heavenly realm. 
2CO.5.2	We inwardly sigh 
2CO.5.3	in the belief that once we put on our new “clothing” we won’t find ourselves “naked.” 
2CO.5.4	So, while living in this “tent,” we groan under its burden, not because we want to die but because we want these new bodies. We crave for all that is mortal to be swallowed up by 
2CO.5.5	, for God himself is the one who has prepared us for this wonderful destiny. And to confirm this promise, he has given us the Holy Spirit, like an engagement ring, as a guarantee.
2CO.5.6	That’s why we’re always full of courage. Even while we’re at home in the body, we’re homesick to be with the Master—
2CO.5.7	for we live by faith, not by what we see with our eyes. 
2CO.5.8	We live with a joyful confidence, yet at the same time we take delight in the thought of leaving our bodies behind to be at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	So whether we live or die we make it our life’s passion to live our lives pleasing to him. 
2CO.5.10	For one day we will all be openly revealed before Christ on his throne so that each of us will be duly recompensed for our actions done in life, whether good or worthless.
2CO.5.11	Since we are those who stand in holy awe of the Lord, we make it our passion to persuade others 
2CO.5.12	Again, we are not taking an opportunity to brag, 
2CO.5.13	If we are out of our minds in a blissful, divine ecstasy, it is for God, but if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. 
2CO.5.14	For it is Christ’s love that fuels our passion and motivates us, because we are absolutely convinced that he has given his life for all of us. This means all died with him, 
2CO.5.15	so that those who live should no longer live self-absorbed lives but lives that are poured out for him—the one who died for us and now lives again. 
2CO.5.16	So then, from now on, we have a new perspective that refuses to evaluate people merely by their outward appearances. For that’s how we once viewed the Anointed One, but no longer do we see him with limited human insight.
2CO.5.17	Now, if anyone is enfolded into Christ, he has become an entirely new person. All that is related to the old order has vanished. Behold, everything is fresh and new. 
2CO.5.18	And God has made all things new, and reconciled us to himself, and given us the ministry of reconciling others to God. 
2CO.5.19	In other words, it was through the Anointed One that God was shepherding the world, not even keeping records of their transgressions, and he has entrusted to us the ministry of opening the door of reconciliation to God. 
2CO.5.20	We are ambassadors of the Anointed One who carry the message of Christ to the world, as though God were tenderly pleading with them directly through our lips. So we tenderly plead with you on Christ’s behalf, “Turn back to God and be reconciled to him.” 
2CO.5.21	For God made the only one who did not know sin to become sin for us, so that we 
2CO.6.1	Now, since we are God’s coworkers, we beg you not to take God’s marvelous grace for granted, 
2CO.6.2	For he says,
2CO.6.2	I listened to you at the time of my favor.
2CO.6.2	And the day when you needed salvation,
2CO.6.2	I came to your aid.
2CO.6.2	So can’t you see? Now is the time to respond to his favor! Now is the day of salvation! 
2CO.6.3	We will not place obstacles in anyone’s way that hinder them 
2CO.6.4	Yet, as God’s servants, we prove ourselves authentic in every way. 
2CO.6.4	We have great endurance in hardships and in persecutions. 
2CO.6.5	We’ve been beaten many times, imprisoned, and 
2CO.6.6	 by our lifestyles of purity, by our spiritual insights, by our patience, and by showing kindness, by the Spirit of holiness and by our uncritical love for you.
2CO.6.7	 by our truthful teachings, by the power of God 
2CO.6.8	Amid honor or dishonor, slander or praise—
2CO.6.9	We are unknown nobodies whom everyone knows. We are frequently at death’s door, yet here we are, still alive! We have been severely punished yet not executed.
2CO.6.10	We may suffer, yet in every season we are always found rejoicing. We may be poor, yet we bestow great riches on many. We seem to have nothing, yet in reality we possess all things.
2CO.6.11	My friends at Corinth, our hearts are wide open to you and we speak freely, holding nothing back from you. 
2CO.6.12	If there is a block in our relationship, it is not with us, for we carry you in our hearts with great love, yet you still withhold your affections from us. 
2CO.6.13	So I speak to you as our children. Make room in your hearts for us as we have done for you.
2CO.6.14	Don’t continue to team up with unbelievers in mismatched alliances, for what partnership is there between righteousness and rebellion? Who could mingle light with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	What harmony can there be between Christ and Satan? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	What friendship does God’s temple have with demons? For indeed, we are the temple of the living God, just as God has said:
2CO.6.16	I will make my home in them and walk among them.
2CO.6.16	I will be their God, and they will be my people.
2CO.6.17	For this reason,
2CO.6.17	“Come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord.
2CO.6.17	“Touch nothing that is unclean, and I will embrace you.
2CO.6.18	I will be a true Father to you,
2CO.6.18	and you will be my beloved sons and daughters,”
2CO.6.18	says the Lord Yahweh Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Beloved ones, with promises like these, and because of our deepest respect and worship of God, we must remove everything from our lives that contaminates body and spirit, and continue to complete the development of holiness within us.
2CO.7.2	Again, I urge you, make room for us in your hearts, for we have wronged no one, corrupted no one, and taken advantage of no one. 
2CO.7.3	I’m not saying this to condemn you, for I already told you that we carry you permanently in our hearts—and you’ll stay there throughout our lives, for we will live together and die together. 
2CO.7.4	With an open heart let me freely say how very proud I am of you and how often I boast about you. In fact, 
2CO.7.5	Even after we came into the province of Macedonia, we found no relief. We were restless and exhausted; troubles met us at every turn. Outwardly I faced conflicts and inwardly emotional turmoil. 
2CO.7.6	But God, who always knows how to encourage the depressed, encouraged us greatly by the arrival of Titus. 
2CO.7.7	We were relieved not only to see him but because of the report he brought us of how you refreshed his heart. He told us of your affection toward me, your deep remorse, and how concerned you were for me. This truly made my heart leap for joy!
2CO.7.8	Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don’t regret sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it grieved you). 
2CO.7.9	Now I’m overjoyed—not because I made you sad, but because your grief led you to a deep repentance. You experienced godly sorrow, and as God intended, it brought about gain for you, not loss, so that no harm has been done by us. 
2CO.7.10	God designed us to feel remorse over sin in order to produce repentance that leads to victory. This leaves us with no regrets. But the sorrow of the world works death.
2CO.7.11	Can’t you see the good fruit that has come, as God intended, because of your remorse over sin? Now you are eager to do what is right! Look at the indignation you experienced over what happened and how alarmed you became. What holy longing it awakened, what passion 
2CO.7.12	So I wrote you not simply to correct the one who did the wrong or on the behalf of the one who was wronged, but to help you realize in God’s sight how loyal you are to us. 
2CO.7.13	Your response leaves us so encouraged! You’ve made us even more joyful upon hearing of how you refreshed Titus, for his mind was set at ease by all of you. 
2CO.7.14	I have not been embarrassed by you, for the things I bragged about you to Titus were not proven false. Just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has proven to be true as well. 
2CO.7.15	His affection toward you has grown as he remembers your obedience and how warmly you welcomed him with fear and trembling. 
2CO.7.16	I’m beside myself with joy! I am so confident in you!
2CO.8.1	Beloved ones, we must tell you about the grace God poured out upon the churches of Macedonia. 
2CO.8.2	For even during a season of severe difficulty and tremendous suffering, they became even more filled with joy. From the depths of their extreme poverty, super-abundant joy overflowed into an act of extravagant generosity. 
2CO.8.3	For I can verify that they spontaneously gave, not only according to their means but far beyond what they could afford. 
2CO.8.4	They actually begged us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry of giving to God’s holy people 
2CO.8.5	They exceeded our expectations by first dedicating themselves fully to the Lord and then to us, according to God’s pleasure. 
2CO.8.6	That is why we appealed to Titus, since he was the one who got you started and encouraged you to give, so he could help you complete this generous undertaking on your behalf. 
2CO.8.7	You do well and excel in every respect—in unstoppable faith, in powerful preaching, in revelation knowledge, in your passionate devotion, and in sharing the love we have shown to you. So make sure that you also excel in grace-filled generosity.
2CO.8.8	I’m not saying this as though I were issuing an order but to stir you to greater love by mentioning the enthusiasm 
2CO.8.9	For you have experienced the extravagant grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was infinitely rich, he impoverished himself for our sake, so that by his poverty, we could become rich beyond measure.
2CO.8.10	So here are my thoughts concerning this matter, and it’s in your best interests. Since you made such a good start last year, both in the grace of giving and in your longing to give, 
2CO.8.11	you should finish what you started. You were so eager in your intentions to give, so go do it. Finish this act of worship according to your ability to give. 
2CO.8.12	For if the intention and desire are there, 
2CO.8.13	I’m not saying this in order to ease someone else’s load by overloading you, but as a matter of fair balance. 
2CO.8.14	Your surplus could meet their need, and their abundance may one day meet your need. This equal sharing of abundance will mean a fair balance. 
2CO.8.15	As it is written:
2CO.8.15	The one who gathered much didn’t have too much,
2CO.8.15	and the one who gathered little didn’t have too little.
2CO.8.16	We give thanks to God for putting the same devotion I have for you into the heart of Titus. 
2CO.8.17	Of course, he enthusiastically accepted our request to go to Corinth, but because he carries you in his heart, he’d already planned on coming. 
2CO.8.18	So we’re sending with him the brother who is greatly honored and respected in all the churches for his work of evangelism. 
2CO.8.19	Not only that, he has been appointed by the churches to be our traveling companion as we carry and dispense this generous gift that glorifies the Lord and shows how eager we are to help. 
2CO.8.20	 in order to avoid any criticism over how we handle this wonderfully generous gift, 
2CO.8.21	for we intend to do what is right and we are totally open both to the Lord’s inspection and to man’s. 
2CO.8.22	So we’re sending with them another brother who is faithful and proven to be a man of integrity. He is passionate to help you now more than ever, for he believes in you.
2CO.8.23	Concerning the credentials of Titus, he’s my partner and coworker in ministry for you. As for the brothers coming with him, they are apostles of the churches, which are the glory of the Anointed One. 
2CO.8.24	So demonstrate to them how much you love, and prove that our boasting of you is justified.
2CO.9.1	Actually, there’s no need to write you about this contribution for the holy believers 
2CO.9.2	for I already know that you are on board and eager to help. I keep boasting to the churches of Macedonia about your passion to give, telling them that the believers of Corinth have been preparing to give for a year. Your enthusiasm is contagious—it has stirred many of them to do likewise. 
2CO.9.3	Still, I thought it would be best to send these brothers to receive the offering that you’ve prepared, so that our boasting about how you were ready to give would not be found hollow. 
2CO.9.4	For if, after boasting of our confidence in you, some of the Macedonians were to come with me and find that you were not prepared, we would be embarrassed—to say nothing of you. 
2CO.9.5	That’s why I’ve requested that the brothers come before I do and make arrangements in advance for the substantial offering you pledged. Then it will be seen as a matter of generosity and not under pressure, as something you felt forced to do.
2CO.9.6	Here’s my point. A stingy sower will reap a meager harvest, but the one who sows from a generous spirit will reap an abundant harvest. 
2CO.9.7	Let giving flow from your heart, not from a sense of religious duty. Let it spring up freely from the joy of giving—all because God loves hilarious generosity! 
2CO.9.8	Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything—every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do. 
2CO.9.9	Just as the Scriptures say 
2CO.9.9	Because he has sown extravagantly and given to the poor,
2CO.9.9	his kindness and generous deeds will never be forgotten.
2CO.9.10	This generous God who supplies abundant seed for the farmer, 
2CO.9.11	You will be abundantly enriched in every way as you give generously on every occasion, for when we take your gifts to those in need, it causes many to give thanks to God.
2CO.9.12	The priestly ministry you are providing through your offering not only supplies what is lacking for God’s people, it inspires an outpouring of praises and thanksgiving to God himself. 
2CO.9.13	For as your extremely generous offering meets the approval 
2CO.9.14	Because of this extraordinary grace, which God has lavished on you, they will affectionately remember you in their prayers. 
2CO.9.15	Praise God for his astonishing gift, which is far too great for words!
2CO.10.1	Now, please listen, for I need to address an issue. I’m making this personal appeal to you by the gentleness and self-forgetfulness of Christ. I am the one who is “humble and timid” when face-to-face with you but “bold and outspoken” when a safe distance away. 
2CO.10.2	Now I plead with you that when I come, don’t force me to take a hard line with you (which I’m willing to do) by daring to confront those who mistakenly believe that we are living by the standards of the world, 
2CO.10.3+2CO.10.4	For although we live in the natural realm, we don’t wage a military campaign employing human weapons, 
2CO.10.5	We can demolish every deceptive fantasy that opposes God and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of God. We capture, like prisoners of war, every thought and insist that it bow in obedience to the Anointed One. 
2CO.10.6	, we stand ready to punish any trace of rebellion, as soon as you choose complete obedience.
2CO.10.7	You seem to always be looking at people by their outward appearances. If someone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: we belong to Christ no less than he does. 
2CO.10.8	I am not ashamed, even if I’ve come across as one who has overstated the authority given to us by the Lord. For it is the authority to help build you up, not tear you down. 
2CO.10.9	I don’t want to seem as though I’m trying to bully you with my letters. 
2CO.10.10	For I can imagine some of you saying, “His letters are authoritative and stern, but when he’s with us he’s not that impressive and he’s a poor speaker.” 
2CO.10.11	Such a person should realize that when we arrive, there will be no difference in the actions we take and the words we write.
2CO.10.12	Of course, we wouldn’t dare to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly. They compare themselves to one another and make up their own standards to measure themselves by, and then they judge themselves by their own standards. What self-delusion! 
2CO.10.13	But we are those who choose to limit our boasting to only the measure of the work to which God has appointed us—a measure that, by the way, has reached as far as you. 
2CO.10.14	And since you are within our assigned limits, we didn’t overstep our boundaries of authority by being the first to announce to you the wonderful news of the Anointed One. 
2CO.10.15	We’re not trying to take credit for the ministry done by others, going beyond the limits 
2CO.10.16	Then we can go and preach the good news in the regions beyond you without trespassing on the ministry sphere of other laborers and what they have already done. 
2CO.10.17	For:
2CO.10.17	The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.
2CO.10.18	 To have the Lord’s approval and commendation is of greater value than bragging about oneself.
2CO.11.1	Now, please bear with some of my “craziness” for a moment. Yes, please be patient with me.
2CO.11.2	 God’s passion is burning inside me for you, because, like a loving father, I have pledged your hand in marriage to Christ, your true bridegroom. I’ve also promised that I would present his fiancée to him as a pure virgin bride. 
2CO.11.3	But now I’m afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s clever lies, your thoughts may be corrupted and you may lose your single-hearted devotion and pure love for Christ. 
2CO.11.4	For you seem to gladly tolerate anyone who comes to you preaching a pseudo-Jesus, not the Jesus we have preached. You have accepted a spirit and gospel that is false, rather than the Spirit and gospel you once embraced. How tolerant you have become of these imposters!
2CO.11.5	Now, I believe that I am not inferior in any way to these special “super-apostles” you are attracted to. 
2CO.11.6	For although I may not be a polished or eloquent speaker, I’m certainly not an amateur in revelation knowledge. Indeed, we have demonstrated this to you time and again.
2CO.11.7	Have I committed a sin by degrading myself to dignify you? Was I wrong to preach the gospel of God to you free of charge? 
2CO.11.8	I received ample financial support from other churches just so that I could 
2CO.11.9	Remember, when I was with you I didn’t bother anyone when I needed money, for my needs were always supplied by my Macedonian friends. So I was careful, and will continue to be careful, that I never become a burden to you in any way.
2CO.11.10	As the reality of Christ lives within me, my glad boast 
2CO.11.11	Why? Is it because I have no love for you? God knows how much I love you! 
2CO.11.12	But in order to eliminate the opportunity for those “super-apostles” to boast that their ministry is on the same level as ours I will continue this practice. 
2CO.11.13	For they are not true apostles but deceitful ministers who masquerade as “special apostles” of the Anointed One. 
2CO.11.14	That doesn’t surprise us, for even Satan transforms himself to appear as an angel of light! 
2CO.11.15	So it’s no wonder his servants also go about pretending to be ministers of righteousness. But in the end they will be exposed and get exactly what they deserve.
2CO.11.16	So I repeat. Let no one think that I’m a fool. But if you do, at least show me the patience you would show a fool, so that I too may boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	Of course, what I’m about to tell you is not with the Lord’s authority, but as a “fool.” 
2CO.11.18	For since many love to boast about their worldly achievements, allow me the opportunity to join them. 
2CO.11.19	And since you are so smart and so wise to gladly put up with the foolishness of others, 
2CO.11.20	You actually allow these imposters to put you into bondage, take complete advantage of you, and rob you blind! How easily you endure those who, in their arrogance, destroy your dignity or even slap you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	I must admit, to our shame that we were too “weak” to relate to you the way they do. But now let me dare to boast like a “fool.”
2CO.11.22	Are these “super-apostles” of yours Hebrews? I am too. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? Me too! 
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of the Anointed One? I’m beside myself when I speak this way, but I am much more of a servant than they. I have worked much harder for God, taken more beatings, and been dragged to more prisons than they. I’ve been flogged excessively, multiple times, even to the point of death.
2CO.11.24	Five times I’ve received thirty-nine lashes from the Jewish leaders. 
2CO.11.25	Three times I experienced being beaten with rods. Once they stoned me. Three times I’ve been shipwrecked; for an entire night and a day I was adrift in the open sea. 
2CO.11.26	In my difficult travels I’ve faced many dangerous situations: perilous rivers, robbers, foreigners, and even my own people. I’ve survived deadly peril in the city, in the wilderness, with storms at sea, and with spies posing as believers. 
2CO.11.27	I’ve toiled to the point of exhaustion and gone through many sleepless nights. I’ve frequently been deprived of food and water, left hungry and shivering out in the cold, lacking proper clothing.
2CO.11.28	And besides these painful circumstances, I have the daily pressure of my responsibility for all the churches, with a deep concern weighing heavily on my heart for their welfare. 
2CO.11.29	, for who is 
2CO.11.30	If boasting is necessary, I will boast about examples of my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is eternally praised, knows that I am speaking the truth. 
2CO.11.32	Once, when I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had his troops searching for me to have me arrested, 
2CO.11.33	but I was stuffed in a basket and lowered down through a window and managed to escape.
2CO.12.1	Although it may not accomplish a thing, I need to move on and boast about supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	Someone I’m acquainted with, who is in union with Christ, was swept away fourteen years ago in an ecstatic experience. He was taken into the third heaven, but I’m not sure if he was in his body or out of his body—only God knows. 
2CO.12.3	And I know that this man (again, I’m not sure if he was still in his body or taken out of his body—God knows) 
2CO.12.4	was caught up in an ecstatic experience and brought into paradise, where he overheard many wondrous and inexpressible secrets 
2CO.12.5	I’m ready to boast of such an experience, but for my own good I refuse to boast unless it concerns my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	However, if I were to boast, it wouldn’t be ridiculous at all, for I would be speaking the truth. Yet I will refrain, lest others think higher of me than what I demonstrate with my life and teaching.
2CO.12.7	The extraordinary level of the revelations I’ve received is no reason for anyone to exalt me. For this is why a thorn in my flesh was given to me, the Adversary’s messenger sent to harass me, keeping me from becoming arrogant. 
2CO.12.8	Three times I pleaded with the Lord to relieve me of this. 
2CO.12.9	But he answered me, 
2CO.12.10	So I’m 
2CO.12.11	I have become foolish 
2CO.12.12	The things that distinguish a true apostle were performed among you with great perseverance—supernatural signs, startling wonders, and awesome miracles.
2CO.12.13	Furthermore, how were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I didn’t burden you financially—forgive me for depriving you! 
2CO.12.14	And now here I am, ready to come to you for the third time, and I still refuse to be a burden to you. For what I really want is your hearts, not your money. After all, children should not have to accumulate resources for their parents, but parents do this for their children. 
2CO.12.15	, I will gladly spend all that I have and all that I am for you! If I love you more, will you respond by loving me less?
2CO.12.16	Be that as it may, I haven’t been a burden to you at all, yet you say of me, “He’s a scoundrel and a trickster!” 
2CO.12.17	 Did I somehow cheat or trick you through any of the men I sent your way? 
2CO.12.18	I was the one who insisted that Titus and our brother come 
2CO.12.19	I hope that you don’t assume that all this time we have simply been justifying ourselves in your eyes? Beloved ones, we have been speaking to you in the sight of God as those joined to Christ, and everything we do is meant to build you up and make you stronger in your faith. 
2CO.12.20	Now I’m afraid that when I come to you I may find you different than I desire you to be, and you may find me different than you would like me to be. I don’t want to find you in disunity, with jealousy and angry outbursts, with selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and turmoil. 
2CO.12.21	I’m actually afraid that on my next visit my God will humble me in front of you as I shed tears over those who keep sinning without repenting of their impurity, sexual immorality, and perversion.
2CO.13.1	This will be my third trip to you. And I will make sure that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter will be confirmed. 
2CO.13.2+2CO.13.3	Since you are demanding proof that the Anointed One is speaking through me, 
2CO.13.4	For although he was crucified as a “weakling,” now he lives 
2CO.13.5	Now your souls will be strengthened and healed if you hold steadfast to your faith. Haven’t you already experienced Jesus Christ himself living in you? If not, you are deficient. 
2CO.13.6	I hope you understand that we cannot be devalued. 
2CO.13.7	But we pray to God that you will be flawless, not to validate our ministry among you but so that you may continue on the path of righteousness even if we are denigrated. 
2CO.13.8	For in reality, the power we have is used in support of the truth, not against it. 
2CO.13.9	And we claim before God that you will be fully equipped and mature, for it brings us great joy when you are strong, even if we seem weak and denigrated.
2CO.13.10	I’m writing my honest feelings to you from afar so that when I arrive I won’t have to correct you by using the authority the Lord has given me, for I want to build you up and not tear you down.
2CO.13.11	Finally, beloved friends, be cheerful! Repair whatever is broken among you, as your hearts are being knit together in perfect unity. Live continually in peace, and God, the source of love and peace, will mingle with you. 
2CO.13.12	Greet and embrace one another with the sacred kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All of God’s holy people send their greetings.
2CO.13.14	Now, may the grace and joyous favor of the Lord Jesus Christ, the unambiguous love of God, and the precious communion that we share in the Holy Spirit be yours continually. Amen!
GAL.1.1	 Paul and I have been commissioned as an apostle of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah. My apostleship was not granted to me by any council of men, for I was appointed by Jesus, the Anointed One, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead. 
GAL.1.2	I am joined by all the brothers and sisters who are here with me as I write you this letter, which is to be distributed to the churches throughout the region of central Turkey.
GAL.1.3+GAL.1.4	 the blessings of God’s undeserved kindness and total well-being that flows from our Father-God and from the Lord Jesus. He’s the Anointed Messiah who offered himself as the sacrifice for our sins! He has taken us out of this evil world system and set us free through our salvation, just as God desired. 
GAL.1.5	All the glory will go to God alone, throughout time and eternity. Amen!
GAL.1.6	I am shocked over how quickly you have strayed away from the One who called you in the grace of Christ. I’m frankly astounded that you now embrace a distorted gospel! 
GAL.1.7	That is a fake “gospel” that is simply not true. There is only one gospel—the gospel of the Messiah! Yet you have allowed those who mingle law with grace to confuse you with lies.
GAL.1.8	Anyone who comes to you with a different message than the grace gospel that you have received will have the curse of God come upon them! For even if we or an angel appeared before you, to give you a different gospel than what we have already proclaimed, God’s curse will be upon them.
GAL.1.9	I will make it clear: Anyone, no matter who they are, that brings you a different gospel than the grace gospel that you have received, let them be condemned and cursed!
GAL.1.10	I’m obviously not trying to flatter you or water down my message to be popular with men, but my supreme passion is to please God. For if all I attempt to do is please people, I would not be the true servant of the Messiah.
GAL.1.11	Beloved ones, let me say emphatically that the gospel entrusted to me was not given to me by any man. 
GAL.1.12	No one taught me this revelation, for it was given to me directly by the unveiling of Jesus the Anointed One.
GAL.1.13	By now you have heard stories of how severely I harassed and persecuted Christians and did my best to systematically destroy God’s church, all because of my radical devotion to the Jewish religion. 
GAL.1.14	My zeal and passion for the doctrines of Judaism distinguished me among my people, for I was far more advanced in my religious instruction than others my age.
GAL.1.15	But then God called me by his grace; and in love, he chose me from my birth to be his. 
GAL.1.16	God’s grace unveiled his Son in me so that I would proclaim him to the non-Jewish people of the world. After I had this encounter I kept it a secret for some time, sharing it with no one. 
GAL.1.17	And I chose not to run to Jerusalem to try to impress those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I went away into the Arabian Desert for a season until I returned to Damascus, 
GAL.1.18	I remained there for three years until I eventually went up to Jerusalem and met the apostle Peter and stayed with him for a couple of weeks so I could get to know him better. 
GAL.1.19	The only other apostle I met during that time was James, the Lord’s brother.
GAL.1.20	Everything I’m describing to you I confess before God is the absolute truth. 
GAL.1.21	After my stay in Jerusalem, I went to Syria and southeast Turkey, 
GAL.1.22	but remained unknown to the Jewish believers in Judea. 
GAL.1.23	The only thing they heard about me was this: “Our former enemy, who once brutally persecuted us, is now preaching the good news of the faith that he was once obsessed with destroying!” 
GAL.1.24	, they praised God even more!
GAL.2.1	Fourteen years later I returned to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas and Titus, 
GAL.2.2	God had given me a clear revelation to go and confer with the other apostles concerning the message of grace I was preaching to the non-Jewish people. I spoke privately with those who were viewed as senior leaders of the church. I wanted to make certain that my labor and ministry for the Messiah had not been based on a false understanding of the gospel.
GAL.2.3	They even accepted Titus without demanding that he follow strict Jewish customs before they would receive him as a brother since he was a Syrian and not a Jew.
GAL.2.4	I met with them privately and confidentially because false “brothers” had been secretly smuggled into the church meetings. They were sent to spy on the wonderful liberty and freedom that we have in Jesus the Anointed One. Their agenda was to bring us back into the legalistic bondage of religion. 
GAL.2.5	But you must know that we did not submit to their religious shackles not even for a moment, so that we might keep the gospel of grace unadulterated for you.
GAL.2.6	Even the most honored and esteemed among the brothers were not able to add anything to my message. Who they are before men makes no difference to me, for God is not impressed by the reputations of men. 
GAL.2.7	So they concluded that I was entrusted with taking the gospel to the non-Jewish people just as Peter was entrusted with taking it to the Jews. 
GAL.2.8	For the same God who anointed Peter to be an apostle to the Jews also anointed me as an apostle to those who are not Jewish.
GAL.2.9	When they all recognized this grace operating in my ministry, James, Peter, and John, the esteemed followers of Jesus, extended to me the warmth of Christian fellowship and honored my calling to minister to the non-Jewish people. 
GAL.2.10	They simply requested one thing of me: that I would remember the poor and needy, which was the burden I was already carrying in my heart.
GAL.2.11	But when Peter visited Antioch, he began to mislead the believers 
GAL.2.12	He enjoyed being with the non-Jewish believers who didn’t keep the Jewish customs, eating his meals with them—up until the time the Jewish friends of James arrived from Jerusalem. When he saw them, he withdrew from his non-Jewish friends and separated himself from them, acting like an orthodox Jew—fearing how it would look to them if he ate with the non-Jewish believers.
GAL.2.13	And so because of Peter’s hypocrisy, many other Jewish believers followed suit, refusing to eat with non-Jewish believers. Even Barnabas was led astray by their poor example and condoned this legalistic, hypocritical behavior!
GAL.2.14	So when I realized they were acting inconsistently with the revelation of grace, I confronted Peter in front of everyone:
GAL.2.14	“You were born a Jew and yet you’ve chosen to disregard Jewish regulations and live like a gentile. Why then do you force those who are not Jews to conform to the regulations of Judaism?
GAL.2.15	“Although we’re Jews by birth and not non-Jewish ‘sinners,’ 
GAL.2.16	we know full well that we don’t receive God’s perfect righteousness as a reward for keeping the law, but by the faith of Jesus, the Messiah! His faithfulness, not ours, has saved us, and we have received God’s perfect righteousness. Now we know that God accepts no one by the keeping of religious laws!
GAL.2.17	“If we are those who desire to be saved from our sins through our union with the Anointed One, does that mean our Messiah promotes our sins if we still acknowledge that we are sinners? How absurd! 
GAL.2.18	For if I start over and reconstruct the old religious system that I have torn down with the message of grace, I will appear to be one who turns his back on the truth.
GAL.2.19	“But because the Messiah lives in me, I’ve now died to the law’s dominion over me so that I can live for God.
GAL.2.20	“My old identity has been co-crucified with Messiah and no longer lives; 
GAL.2.21	“So that is why I don’t view God’s grace as something minor or peripheral. For if keeping the law could release God’s righteousness to us, the Anointed One would have died for nothing.”
GAL.3.1	What has happened to you Galatians to be acting so foolishly? You must have been under some evil spell! Didn’t God open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus’ crucifixion? Wasn’t he revealed to you as the crucified one?
GAL.3.2	So answer me this: Did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping all the Jewish laws? No, you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah. 
GAL.3.3	Your new life in the Anointed One began with the Holy Spirit giving you a new birth. Why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the Spirit by trying to finish by your own works?
GAL.3.4	Have you endured all these trials and persecutions for nothing?
GAL.3.5	Let me ask you again: What does the lavish supply of the Holy Spirit in your life, and the miracles of God’s tremendous power, have to do with you keeping religious laws? The Holy Spirit is poured out upon us through the revelation and power of faith, not by keeping the law!
GAL.3.6	Abraham, our father of faith, led the way as our pioneering example. He believed God and the substance of his faith released God’s righteousness to him. 
GAL.3.7	So those who are the true children of Abraham will have the same faith as their father! 
GAL.3.8	God’s plan all along was to bring this message of salvation to the nations through the revelation of faith. Long ago God prophesied over Abraham, as the Holy Scriptures say:
GAL.3.8	“Through your example of faith all the nations will be blessed!”
GAL.3.9	And so the blessing of Abraham’s faith is now our blessing too! 
GAL.3.10	But if you choose to live in bondage under the legalistic rule of religion, you live under the law’s curse. For it is clearly written:
GAL.3.10	“Utterly cursed is everyone who fails to practice every detail and requirement that is written in this law!”
GAL.3.11	, and it is obvious, that no one achieves the righteousness of God by attempting to keep the law, for it is written:
GAL.3.11	“Those who have been made holy will live by faith!”
GAL.3.12	But keeping the law does not require faith, 
GAL.3.12	“If you practice the principles of law, you must follow all of them.”
GAL.3.13	Yet, Christ paid the full price to set us free from the curse of the law. He absorbed it completely as he became a curse in our place. For it is written:
GAL.3.13	“Everyone who is hung upon a tree is doubly cursed.”
GAL.3.14	Jesus, our Messiah, was cursed in our place and in so doing, dissolved the curse from our lives, so that all the blessings of Abraham can be poured out upon even non-Jewish believers. And now God gives us the promise of the wonderful Holy Spirit who lives within us when we believe in him.
GAL.3.15	Beloved friends, let me use an illustration that we can all understand. Technically, when a contract is signed, it can’t be changed after it has been put into effect; it’s too late to alter the agreement.
GAL.3.16	Remember the royal proclamation God spoke over Abraham and to Abraham’s child? God said that his promises were made to pass on to Abraham’s “Child,” not children. And who is this “Child?” It’s the Son of promise, Jesus, the anointed Messiah!
GAL.3.17+GAL.3.18	This means that the covenant between God and Abraham was fulfilled in Messiah and cannot be altered. Yet the written law was not even given to Moses until 430 years later, after God had “signed” his contract with Abraham! The law, then, doesn’t supersede the promise since the royal proclamation was given before the law.
GAL.3.17+GAL.3.18	If that were the case, it would have nullified what God said to Abraham. We receive all the promises because of the Promised One—not because we keep the law!
GAL.3.19	Why then was the law given? It was meant to be an intermediary agreement added after God gave the promise of the coming One! It was given to show men how guilty they are, and it remained in force until the Seed was born to fulfill the promises given to Abraham. When God gave the law, he didn’t give it to them directly, for he gave it first to the angels; they gave it to 
GAL.3.20	Now, a mediator does not represent just one party alone, but God fulfilled it all by himself!
GAL.3.21	Since that’s true, should we consider the written law to be contrary to the promise of new life? How absurd! Truly, if there was a law that we could keep which would give us new life, then our salvation would have come by law-keeping. 
GAL.3.22	But the Scriptures make it clear that since we were all under the power of sin, we needed Jesus! And he is the Savior who brings the promise to those who believe.
GAL.3.23	So until the revelation of faith for salvation was released, the law was a jailer, holding us as prisoners under lock and key until the “faith,” which was destined to be revealed, 
GAL.3.24	The law becomes a gateway to lead us to the Messiah so that we would be saved by faith. 
GAL.3.25	But when faith comes the law is no longer in force, since we have already entered into life.
GAL.3.26	You have all become true children of God by faith in Jesus the Anointed One! 
GAL.3.27	It was faith that immersed you into Jesus, the Anointed One, and now you are covered and clothed with his anointing. 
GAL.3.28	And we no longer see each other in our former state—Jew or non-Jew, rich or poor, male or female—because we’re all one through our union with Jesus Christ 
GAL.3.29	And since you’ve been united to Jesus the Messiah, you are now Abraham’s “child” and inherit all the promises of the kingdom realm!
GAL.4.1	In a similar way, God has promised our ancestors something better, but as long as an heir is a minor, he’s not really much different than a servant, although he’s the master over all of them. 
GAL.4.2	For until the time appointed by the father when he comes of age, the child is under the domestic supervision of the guardians of the estate.
GAL.4.3	So it is with us. When we were juveniles we were enslaved under the hostile spirits of the world. 
GAL.4.4	But when that era came to an end and the time of fulfillment had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the written law. 
GAL.4.5	Yet all of this was so that he would redeem and set free all those held hostage to the written law so that we would receive our freedom and a full legal adoption as his children.
GAL.4.6	And so that we would know for sure that we are his true children, God released the Spirit of Sonship into our hearts—moving us to cry out intimately, “My Father! You’re our true Father!”
GAL.4.7	Now we’re no longer living like slaves 
GAL.4.8	Before we knew God as our Father and we became his children, we were unwitting servants to the powers that be, which are nothing compared to God. 
GAL.4.9	But now that we truly know him and understand how deeply we’re loved by him, why would we, even for a moment, consider turning back to those weak and feeble principles of religion, 
GAL.4.10	Why 
GAL.4.11	I’m so alarmed about you that I’m beginning to wonder if my labor in ministry among you was a waste of time!
GAL.4.12	Beloved ones, I plead with you, follow my example and 
GAL.4.13	You are well aware that the reason I stayed among you to preach the good news was because of the poor state of my health. 
GAL.4.14	And yet you were so kind to me and did not despise me in my weakness, even though my physical condition put you through an ordeal while I was with you.
GAL.4.14	Actually, you received me and cared for me as though I were an angel from God, as you would have cared for Jesus, the Messiah himself! 
GAL.4.15	Some of you were even willing, if it were possible, to pluck out your own eyes to replace mine! Where is that kindhearted and free spirit now? 
GAL.4.16	Have I really become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	Can’t you see what these false teachers are doing? They want to win you over so you will side with them. They want you divided from me so you will follow only them. Would you call that integrity? 
GAL.4.18	Isn’t it better to seek excellence and integrity always, and not just only when I’m with you?
GAL.4.19	You are my dear children, but I agonize in spiritual “labor pains” once again, until the Anointed One will be fully formed in your hearts! 
GAL.4.20	How I wish I could be there in person and change my tone toward you, for I am truly dumbfounded over what you are doing!
GAL.4.21+GAL.4.22	Tell me, do you want to go back to living strictly by the law? Haven’t you ever listened to what the law really says? Have you forgotten that Abraham had two sons; one by the slave girl, and the other by the freewoman?
GAL.4.23	, the son of the slave girl, was a child of the natural realm. But 
GAL.4.24	These two women and their sons express an allegory and become symbols of two covenants. The first covenant was born on Mount Sinai, birthing children into slavery—children born to Hagar. 
GAL.4.25	For “Hagar” represents the law given at Mount Sinai in Arabia. 
GAL.4.26	In contrast, there is a heavenly Jerusalem above us, which is our true “mother.” She is the freewoman, birthing children into freedom! 
GAL.4.27	For it is written:
GAL.4.27	“Burst forth with gladness,
GAL.4.27	O barren woman with no children!
GAL.4.27	Break through with the shouts of joy and jubilee,
GAL.4.27	for you are about to give birth!
GAL.4.27	The one who was once considered desolate and barren
GAL.4.27	now has more children than the one who has a husband!”
GAL.4.28	Dear friends, just like Isaac, we’re now the true children who inherit the kingdom promises. 
GAL.4.29	And just as the son of the natural world at that time harassed the son born of the power of the Holy Spirit, so it is today. 
GAL.4.30	And what does the Scripture tell us to do?
GAL.4.30	“Expel the slave mother with her son!
GAL.4.30	The son of the slave woman will not be a true heir—
GAL.4.30	for the true heir of the promises is the son of the freewoman.”
GAL.4.31	It’s now so obvious! We’re not the children of the slave woman; we’re the supernatural sons of the freewoman—sons of grace!
GAL.5.1	Let me be clear, the Anointed One has set us free—not partially, but completely and wonderfully free! We must always cherish this truth and stubbornly refuse to go back into the bondage of our past.
GAL.5.2	I, Paul, tell you: If you think there is benefit in circumcision and Jewish regulations, then you’re acting as though Jesus the Anointed One is not enough. 
GAL.5.3	I say it again emphatically: If you let yourselves be circumcised you are obliged to fulfill every single one of the commandments and regulations of the law!
GAL.5.4	If you want to be made holy by fulfilling the obligations of the law, you have cut off more than your flesh—you have cut yourselves off from the Anointed One and have fallen away from the revelation of grace!
GAL.5.5	But the Holy Spirit convinces us that we have received by faith the glorious righteousness of the Anointed One. 
GAL.5.6	When you’re placed into the Anointed One and joined to him, circumcision and religious obligations can benefit you nothing. All that matters now is living in the faith that is activated and brought to perfection by love.
GAL.5.7	Before you were led astray, you were so faithful to Messiah. Why have you now turned away from what is right and true? Who has deceived you?
GAL.5.8	The One who enfolded you into his grace is not behind this false teaching that you’ve embraced. Not at all! 
GAL.5.9	Don’t you know that when you allow even a little lie into your heart, it can permeate your entire belief system?
GAL.5.10	Deep in my heart I have faith that the Lord Jesus the Anointed One, who lives in you, will bring you back around to the truth. And I’m convinced that those who agitate you, whoever they think they are, will be brought under God’s judgment!
GAL.5.11	Dear friends, why do you think the religious system persecutes me? Is it because I preach the message of being circumcised and keeping all the laws of Judaism? Not at all! Is there no longer any offense over the cross? 
GAL.5.12	To tell you the truth, I am so disgusted with all your agitators—I wish they would go even further and cut off their legalistic influence from your lives!
GAL.5.13	Beloved ones, God has called us to live a life of freedom in the Holy Spirit. But don’t view this wonderful freedom as an opportunity to set up a base of operations in the natural realm. Freedom means that we become so completely free of self-indulgence that we become servants of one another, expressing love in all we do.
GAL.5.14	For love completes the laws of God. All of the law can be summarized in one grand statement:
GAL.5.14	“Demonstrate love to your neighbor, even as you care for and love yourself.”
GAL.5.15	But if you continue to criticize and come against each other over minor issues, you’re acting like wild beasts trying to destroy one another!
GAL.5.16	As you yield freely and fully to the dynamic life and power of the Holy Spirit, you will abandon the cravings of your self-life. 
GAL.5.17	For your self-life craves the things that offend the Holy Spirit 
GAL.5.18	But when you are brought into the full freedom of the Spirit of grace, you will no longer be living under the domination of the law, 
GAL.5.19	The cravings of the self-life are obvious: Sexual immorality, lustful thoughts, pornography, 
GAL.5.20	chasing after things instead of God, manipulating others, hatred of those who get in your way, senseless arguments, resentment when others are favored, temper tantrums, angry quarrels, only thinking of yourself, being in love with your own opinions, 
GAL.5.21	being envious of the blessings of others, murder, uncontrolled addictions, wild parties, and all other similar behavior.
GAL.5.21	Haven’t I already warned you that those who use their “freedom” for these things will not inherit the kingdom realm of God!
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	But the fruit produced by the Holy Spirit within you is divine love in all its varied expressions:
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	joy 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	peace 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	patience 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	kindness 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	a life full of virtue,
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	faith 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	gentleness 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	strength 
GAL.5.22+GAL.5.23	Never set the law above these qualities, for they are meant to be limitless.
GAL.5.24	Keep in mind that we who belong to Jesus, the Anointed One, have already experienced crucifixion. For everything connected with our self-life was put to death on the cross and crucified with Messiah. 
GAL.5.25	We must live in the Holy Spirit and follow after him. 
GAL.5.26	So may we never be arrogant, or look down on another, 
GAL.6.1	My beloved friends, if you see a believer who is overtaken with a fault, may the one who overflows with the Spirit seek to restore him. Win him over with gentle words, 
GAL.6.2	 fulfill the law of the Anointed One as we carry each other’s troubles. 
GAL.6.3	If you think you are too important to stoop down to help another, you are living in deception.
GAL.6.4	Let everyone be devoted to fulfill the work God has given them to do with excellence, and their joy will be in doing what’s right and being themselves, and not in being affirmed by others. 
GAL.6.5	Every believer is ultimately responsible for his or her own conscience.
GAL.6.6	And those who are taught the Word must share all good things with their teacher; a sharing of wealth takes place between them.
GAL.6.7	Make no mistake about it, God will never be mocked! For what you plant will always be the very thing you harvest. 
GAL.6.8	The harvest you reap reveals the seed that was planted. If you plant the corrupt seeds of self-life into this natural realm, you can expect to experience a harvest of corruption. If you plant the good seeds of Spirit-life you will reap the beautiful fruits that grow from the everlasting life of the Spirit.
GAL.6.9	And don’t allow yourselves to be weary or disheartened in planting good seeds, for the season of reaping the wonderful harvest you’ve planted is coming! 
GAL.6.10	Take advantage of every opportunity to be a blessing to others, especially to our brothers and sisters in the family of faith!
GAL.6.11	I’ve written this letter to you with my own handwriting—see how large I have to make the letters? 
GAL.6.12	All those who insist that you be circumcised are recruiting you so they can boast in their own works. They are attempting to avoid the persecution that comes with preaching the liberating message of the cross of Messiah! 
GAL.6.13	Not even those who are circumcised keep every detail of the written law. Yet they push you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you have become like them.
GAL.6.14	My only boast is in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, our Messiah. In him I have been crucified to this natural realm; and the natural realm is dead to me and no longer dominates my life.
GAL.6.15	Circumcision doesn’t mean a thing to me. The only thing that really matters is living by the transforming power of this wonderful new creation life. 
GAL.6.16	And all those who live in agreement with this standard will have true peace and God’s delight, for they are the Israel of God.
GAL.6.17	From now on, let no one bring me trouble or criticism, for I am carrying the very scars of our Lord Jesus in my body. 
GAL.6.18	Finally my beloved ones—may the wonderful grace of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, be flowing in your spirit. So shall it be!
EPH.1.1	 Paul, and I was chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus, the Messiah. 
EPH.1.2	I’m writing this letter to all the devoted believers who have been made holy by being one with Jesus, the Anointed One.
EPH.1.2	May God himself, the heavenly Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, release grace over you and impart total well-being into your lives.
EPH.1.3	Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm has already been lavished upon us as a love gift from our wonderful heavenly Father, the Father of our Lord Jesus—all because he sees us wrapped into Christ. This is why we celebrate him with all our hearts!
EPH.1.4	And he chose us to be his very own, joining us to himself even before he laid the foundation of the universe! Because of his great love, he ordained us, so that we would be seen as holy in his eyes with an unstained innocence.
EPH.1.5+EPH.1.6	For it was always in his perfect plan to adopt us as his delightful children, through our union with Jesus, the Anointed One, so that his tremendous love that cascades over us would glorify his grace—for the same love he has for his Beloved One, Jesus, he has for us. And this unfolding plan brings him great pleasure!
EPH.1.7	Since we are now joined to Christ, we have been given the treasures of redemption by his blood—the total cancellation of our sins—all because of the cascading riches of his grace. 
EPH.1.8	This superabundant grace is already powerfully working in us, releasing within us all forms of wisdom and practical understanding. 
EPH.1.9	And through the revelation of the Anointed One, he unveiled his secret desires to us—the hidden mystery of his long-range plan, which he was delighted to implement from the very beginning of time. 
EPH.1.10	And because of God’s unfailing purpose, this detailed plan will reign supreme through every period of time until the fulfillment of all the ages finally reaches its climax—when God makes all things new in all of heaven and earth through Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.11	Through our union with Christ we too have been claimed by God as his own inheritance. Before we were even born, he gave us our destiny; that we would fulfill the plan of God who always accomplishes every purpose and plan in his heart. 
EPH.1.12	God’s purpose was that we 
EPH.1.13	And because of him, when you 
EPH.1.14	He is given to us like an engagement ring is given to a bride, as the first installment of what’s coming! He is our hope-promise of a future inheritance which seals us until we have all of redemption’s promises and experience complete freedom—all for the supreme glory and honor of God!
EPH.1.15	Because of this, since I first heard about your strong faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and your tender love toward all his devoted ones, 
EPH.1.16	my heart is always full and overflowing with thanks to God for you as I constantly remember you in my prayers. 
EPH.1.17	I pray that the Father of glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would impart to you the riches of the Spirit of wisdom and the Spirit of revelation to know him through your deepening intimacy with him.
EPH.1.18	I pray that the light of God will illuminate the eyes of your imagination, flooding you with light, until you experience the full revelation of the hope of his calling—that is, the wealth of God’s glorious inheritances that he finds in us, his holy ones!
EPH.1.19	I pray that you will continually experience the immeasurable greatness of God’s power made available to you through faith. Then your lives will be an advertisement of this immense power as it works through you! This is the mighty power 
EPH.1.20	that was released when God raised Christ from the dead and exalted him to the place of highest honor and supreme authority in the heavenly realm! 
EPH.1.21	And now he is exalted as first above every ruler, authority, government, and realm of power in existence! He is gloriously enthroned over every name that is ever praised, not only in this age, but in the age that is coming!
EPH.1.22	And he alone is the leader and source of everything needed in the church. God has put everything beneath the authority of Jesus Christ 
EPH.1.23	And now we, his church, are his body on the earth and that which fills him who is being filled by it!
EPH.2.1	, even though you were once like corpses, dead in your sins and offenses. 
EPH.2.2	It wasn’t that long ago that you lived in the religion, customs, and values of this world, obeying the dark ruler of the earthly realm who fills the atmosphere with his authority, and works diligently in the hearts of those who are disobedient to the truth of God. 
EPH.2.3	The corruption that was in us from birth was expressed through the deeds and desires of our self-life. We lived by whatever natural cravings and thoughts our minds dictated, living as rebellious children subject to God’s wrath like everyone else.
EPH.2.4	But God still loved us with such great love. He is so rich in compassion and mercy. 
EPH.2.5	Even when we were dead and doomed in our many sins, he united us into the very life of Christ and saved us by his wonderful grace! 
EPH.2.6	He raised us up with Christ the exalted One, 
EPH.2.7	Throughout the coming ages we will be the visible display of the infinite, limitless riches of his grace and kindness, which was showered upon us in Jesus Christ. 
EPH.2.8	For it was only through this wonderful grace that we believed in him. Nothing we did could ever earn this salvation, for it was the gracious gift from God that brought us to Christ! 
EPH.2.9	So no one will ever be able to boast, for salvation is never a reward for good works or human striving.
EPH.2.10	We have become his poetry, a re-created people that will fulfill the destiny he has given each of us, for we are joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. Even before we were born, God planned in advance 
EPH.2.11+EPH.2.12	So don’t forget that you were not born as Jews and were uncircumcised (circumcision itself is just a work of man’s hands); you had none of the Jewish covenants and laws; you were foreigners to Israel’s incredible heritage; you were without the covenants and prophetic promises of the Messiah, the promised hope, and without God.
EPH.2.13	 Although you were once distant and far away from God, now you have been brought delightfully close to him through the sacred blood of Jesus—you have actually been united to Christ!
EPH.2.14	Our reconciling “Peace” is Jesus! He has made Jew and non-Jew one 
EPH.2.15	Ethnic hatred has been dissolved by the crucifixion of his precious body on the cross. The legal code that stood condemning every one of us has now been repealed 
EPH.2.16	Two have now become one, and we live restored to God and reconciled in the body of Christ. Through his crucifixion, hatred died. 
EPH.2.17	For the Messiah has come to preach this sweet message of peace to you, the ones who were distant, and to those who are near. 
EPH.2.18	And now, because we are united to Christ, we both have equal and direct access in the realm of the Holy Spirit to come before the Father!
EPH.2.19	So, you are not foreigners or guests, but rather you are the children of the city of the holy ones, with all the rights as family members of the household of God. 
EPH.2.20	; and your lives are being built up together upon the ideal foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, and best of all, you are connected to the Head Cornerstone of the building, the Anointed One, Jesus Christ himself!
EPH.2.21	This entire building is under construction and is continually growing under his supervision until it rises up completed as the holy temple of the Lord himself. 
EPH.2.22	This means that God is transforming each one of you into 
EPH.3.1	Beloved friends, 
EPH.3.2	so that you will hear the gospel that God has entrusted to me to share with you. 
EPH.3.3	For this wonderful mystery, which I briefly described, was given to me by divine revelation, 
EPH.3.4	so that whenever you read it you will be able to understand my revelation and insight into the secret mystery of the Messiah.
EPH.3.5	There has never been a generation that has been given the detailed understanding of this glorious and divine mystery until now. He kept it a secret until this generation. God is revealing it only now to his sacred apostles and prophets by the Holy Spirit. 
EPH.3.6	Here’s the secret: The gospel of grace has made you, non-Jewish believers, into coheirs of his promise through your union with him. And you have now become members of his body—one with the Anointed One!
EPH.3.7+EPH.3.8	I have been made a messenger of this wonderful news by the gift of grace that works through me. Even though I am the least significant of all his holy believers, this grace-gift was imparted when the manifestation of his power came upon me. Grace alone empowers me so that I can boldly preach this wonderful message to non-Jewish people, sharing with them the unfading, inexhaustible riches of Christ, which are beyond comprehension.
EPH.3.9	My passion is to enlighten every person to this divine mystery. It was hidden for ages past until now, and kept a secret in the heart of God, the Creator of all. 
EPH.3.10	The purpose of this was to unveil before every throne and rank of angelic orders in the heavenly realm God’s full and diverse wisdom revealed through the church. 
EPH.3.11	This perfectly wise plan was destined from eternal ages and fulfilled completely in our Lord Jesus Christ, so that now 
EPH.3.12	we have boldness through him, and free access as kings before the Father because of our complete confidence in Christ’s faithfulness.
EPH.3.13	My dear friends, I pray that you will remain strong and not be discouraged or ashamed by all that I suffer on your behalf, for it is for your glory.
EPH.3.14	So I kneel humbly in awe before the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, 
EPH.3.15	the perfect Father of every father and child in heaven and on the earth. 
EPH.3.16	And I pray that he would unveil within you the unlimited riches of his glory and favor until supernatural strength floods your innermost being with his divine might and explosive power.
EPH.3.17	Then, by constantly using your faith, the life of Christ will be released deep inside you, and the resting place of his love will become the very source and root of your life.
EPH.3.18+EPH.3.19	Then you will be empowered to discover what every holy one experiences—the great magnitude of the astonishing love of Christ in all its dimensions. How deeply intimate and far-reaching is his love! How enduring and inclusive it is! Endless love beyond measurement that transcends our understanding—this extravagant love pours into you until you are filled to overflowing with the fullness of God!
EPH.3.20	 God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.
EPH.3.21	Now we offer up to God all the glorious praise that rises from every church in every generation through Jesus Christ—and all that will yet be manifest through time and eternity. Amen!
EPH.4.1	As a prisoner of the Lord, I plead with you to walk holy, in a way that is suitable to your high rank, given to you in your divine calling. 
EPH.4.2	With tender humility and quiet patience, always demonstrate gentleness and generous love toward one another, especially toward those who may try your patience. 
EPH.4.3	Be faithful to guard the sweet harmony of the Holy Spirit among you in the bonds of peace, 
EPH.4.4	being one body and one spirit, as you were all called into the same glorious hope 
EPH.4.5	For the Lord God is one, 
EPH.4.6	And He is the perfect Father who leads us all, works through us all, and lives in us all!
EPH.4.7	And he has generously given each one of us supernatural grace, according to the size of the gift of Christ. 
EPH.4.8	This is why he says:
EPH.4.8	“He ascends into the heavenly heights
EPH.4.8	taking his many captured ones with him,
EPH.4.8	and gifts were given to men.”
EPH.4.9	He “ascended” means that he returned to heaven, after he had first descended from the heights of heaven, even descending as far as the lowest parts of the earth. 
EPH.4.10	The same one who descended is also the one who ascended above the heights of heaven, in order to begin the restoration and fulfillment of all things.
EPH.4.11	And he has appointed some 
EPH.4.12	And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ. 
EPH.4.13	 until we all attain oneness into the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one into a perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed into the abundance of Christ.
EPH.4.14	And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies. 
EPH.4.15	But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. 
EPH.4.16	For his “body” 
EPH.4.17	So with the wisdom given to me from the Lord I say: You should not live like the unbelievers around you who walk in their empty delusions. 
EPH.4.18	Their corrupted logic has been clouded because their hearts are so far from God—their blinded understanding and deep-seated moral darkness keeps them from the true knowledge of God. 
EPH.4.19	Because of spiritual apathy, they surrender their lives to lewdness, impurity, and sexual obsession.
EPH.4.20	But this is not the way of life that Christ has unfolded within you. 
EPH.4.21	If you have really experienced the Anointed One, and heard his truth, 
EPH.4.22	And he has taught you to let go of the lifestyle of the ancient man, the old self-life, which was corrupted by sinful and deceitful desires that spring from delusions. 
EPH.4.23	Now it’s time to be made new by every revelation that’s been given to you. 
EPH.4.24	And to be transformed as you embrace the glorious Christ-within as your new life and live in union with him! For God has re-created you all over again in his perfect righteousness, and you now belong to him in the realm of true holiness. 
EPH.4.25	So discard every form of dishonesty and lying 
EPH.4.26	But don’t let the passion of your emotions lead you to sin! Don’t let anger control you 
EPH.4.27	Don’t give the slanderous accuser, the Devil, an opportunity to manipulate you! 
EPH.4.28	If any one of you has stolen from someone else, never do it again. Instead, be industrious, earning an honest living, and then you’ll have enough to bless those in need.
EPH.4.29	And never let ugly or hateful words come from your mouth, but instead let your words become beautiful gifts that encourage others; do this by speaking words of grace to help them.
EPH.4.30	The Holy Spirit of God has sealed you in Jesus Christ until you experience your full salvation. So never grieve the Spirit of God or take for granted his holy influence in your life. 
EPH.4.31	Lay aside bitter words, temper tantrums, revenge, profanity, and insults. 
EPH.4.32	But instead be kind and affectionate toward one another. Has God graciously forgiven you? Then graciously forgive one another in the depths of Christ’s love.
EPH.5.1	Be imitators of God in everything you do, for then you will represent your Father as his beloved sons and daughters. 
EPH.5.2	And continue to walk surrendered to the extravagant love of Christ, for he surrendered his life as a sacrifice for us. His great love for us was pleasing to God, like an aroma of adoration—a sweet healing fragrance.
EPH.5.3	And have nothing to do with sexual immorality, lust, or greed—for you are his holy ones 
EPH.5.4	Guard your speech. Forsake obscenities and worthless insults; these are nonsensical words that bring disgrace and are unnecessary. Instead, let worship fill your heart and spill out in your words.
EPH.5.5	For it has been made clear to you already that the kingdom of God cannot be accessed by anyone who is guilty of sexual sin, or who is impure or greedy—for greed is the essence of idolatry. How could they expect to have an inheritance in Christ’s kingdom 
EPH.5.6	Don’t be fooled by those who speak their empty words and deceptive teachings telling you otherwise. This is what brings God’s anger upon the rebellious! 
EPH.5.7	Don’t listen to them or live like them at all. 
EPH.5.8	Once your life was full of sin’s darkness, but now you have the very light of our Lord shining through you because of your union with him. Your mission is to live as children flooded with his revelation-light! 
EPH.5.9	And the supernatural fruits of his light will be seen in you—goodness, righteousness, and truth. 
EPH.5.10	Then you will learn to choose what is beautiful to our Lord.
EPH.5.11	And don’t even associate with the servants of darkness because they have no fruit in them; instead, reveal truth to them. 
EPH.5.12	The very things they do in secret are too vile and filthy to even mention. 
EPH.5.13	Whatever the revelation-light exposes, it will also correct, and everything that reveals truth is light to the soul. 
EPH.5.14	This is why the Scripture says,
EPH.5.14	“Arise, you sleeper! Rise up from your coffin and the Anointed One will shine his light into you!”
EPH.5.15+EPH.5.16	So be very careful how you live, not being like those with no understanding, but live honorably with true wisdom, for we are living in evil times. Take full advantage of every day as you spend your life for his purposes. 
EPH.5.17	And don’t live foolishly for then you will have discernment to fully understand God’s will. 
EPH.5.18	And don’t get drunk with wine, which is rebellion; instead be filled with the fullness of the Holy Spirit. 
EPH.5.19	 a joyful song to the Lord Jehovah. Keep speaking to each other with words of Scripture, singing the Psalms with praises and spontaneous songs given by the Spirit! 
EPH.5.20	Always give thanks to Father God for every person 
EPH.5.21	And out of your reverence for Christ be supportive of each other in love.
EPH.5.22	For wives, this means being devoted to your husbands like you are tenderly devoted to our Lord, 
EPH.5.23	for the husband provides leadership for the wife, just as Christ provides leadership for his church, as the Savior and Reviver of the body. 
EPH.5.24	In the same way the church is devoted to Christ, let the wives be devoted to their husbands in everything.
EPH.5.25	And to the husbands, you are to demonstrate love for your wives with the same tender devotion that Christ demonstrated to us, his bride. For he died for us, sacrificing himself 
EPH.5.26	to make us holy and pure, cleansing us through the showering of the pure water of the Word of God. 
EPH.5.27	 to make us a mature church for his pleasure, until we become a source of praise to him—glorious and radiant, beautiful and holy, without fault or flaw.
EPH.5.28	Husbands have the obligation of loving and caring for their wives the same way they love and care for their own bodies, for to love your wife is to love your own self. 
EPH.5.29	No one abuses his own body, but pampers it—serving and satisfying its needs. That’s exactly what Christ does for his church! 
EPH.5.30	 as members of his body.
EPH.5.31	For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and lovingly hold to his wife, since the two have become joined as one flesh. 
EPH.5.32	Marriage is the beautiful design of the Almighty, a great and sacred mystery—
EPH.5.33	So every married man should be gracious to his wife just as he is gracious to himself. And every wife should be tenderly devoted to her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, 
EPH.6.2	For the commandment, “Honor your father and your mother,” was the first of the 
EPH.6.3	“You will prosper and live a long, full life 
EPH.6.4	Fathers, don’t exasperate your children, but raise them up with loving discipline and counsel that brings the revelation of our Lord.
EPH.6.5	Those who are employed should listen to their employers and obey their instructions with great respect and honor. Serve them with humility in your hearts as though you were working for the Master.
EPH.6.6	Always do what is right and not only when others are watching, so that you may please Christ as his servants by doing his will. 
EPH.6.7	Serve your employers wholeheartedly and with love, as though you were serving Christ and not men. 
EPH.6.8	Be assured that anything you do that is beautiful and excellent will be repaid by our Lord, whether you are an employee or an employer.
EPH.6.9	And to the caretakers of the flock I say, do what is right with your people by forgiving them when they offend you, for you know there is a Master in heaven that shows no favoritism.
EPH.6.10	Now my beloved ones, I have saved these most important truths for last: Be supernaturally infused with strength through your life-union with the Lord Jesus. Stand victorious with the force of his explosive power flowing in and through you.
EPH.6.11	Put on God’s complete set of armor provided for us, so that you will be protected as you fight against the evil strategies of the accuser! 
EPH.6.12	Your hand-to-hand combat is not with human beings, but with the highest principalities and authorities operating in rebellion under the heavenly realms. For they are a powerful class of demon-gods and evil spirits that hold this dark world in bondage. 
EPH.6.13	Because of this, you must wear all the armor that God provides so you’re protected as you confront the slanderer, for you are destined for all things and will rise victorious.
EPH.6.14	Put on truth as a belt to strengthen you to stand in triumph. Put on holiness as the protective armor that covers your heart. 
EPH.6.15	Stand on your feet alert, then you’ll always be ready to share the blessings of peace.
EPH.6.16	In every battle, take faith as your wrap-around shield, for it is able to extinguish the blazing arrows coming at you from the Evil One! 
EPH.6.17+EPH.6.18	Embrace the power of salvation’s full deliverance, like a helmet 
EPH.6.17+EPH.6.18	Pray passionately in the Spirit, as you constantly intercede with every form of prayer at all times. Pray the blessings of God upon all his believers. 
EPH.6.19	And pray also that God’s revelation would be released through me every time I preach the wonderful mystery of the hope-filled gospel. 
EPH.6.20	Yes, pray that I may preach the wonderful news of God’s kingdom with bold freedom at every opportunity. Even though I am chained as a prisoner, I am his ambassador.
EPH.6.21+EPH.6.22	I am sending you a dear friend, Tychicus. He is a beloved brother and trustworthy minister in our Lord Jesus. He will share with you all the concerns that I have for your welfare and will inform you of how I am getting along. And he will also prophesy over you to encourage your hearts. 
EPH.6.23	So may God shower his peace upon you, my beloved friends. And may the blessings of faith and love fill your hearts from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus, the Messiah. 
EPH.6.24	Abundant grace will be with you all as each of you love our Lord Jesus Christ without corruption. Amen!
PHP.1.1	From Paul and Timothy, both of us servants of Jesus, the Anointed One. To all his devoted followers in Philippi, including your pastors, and to all the servant-leaders of the church.
PHP.1.2	May the blessings of divine grace and supernatural peace that flow from God our wonderful Father, and our Messiah, the Lord Jesus, be upon your lives.
PHP.1.3+PHP.1.4	My prayers for you are full of praise to God as I give him thanks for you with great joy! 
PHP.1.5	and our enduring partnership that began the first time I presented to you the gospel. 
PHP.1.6	, because I’m fully convinced that the One who began this glorious work in you will faithfully continue the process of maturing you and will put his finishing touches to it until the unveiling of our Lord Jesus Christ!
PHP.1.7	It’s no wonder I pray with such confidence, since you have a permanent place in my heart! You have remained partners with me in the wonderful grace 
PHP.1.8	Only God knows how much I dearly love you with the tender affection of Jesus, the Anointed One.
PHP.1.9	I continue to pray for your love to grow and increase beyond measure, bringing you into the rich revelation of spiritual insight in all things.
PHP.1.10	This will enable you to choose the most excellent way of all—becoming pure and without offense until the unveiling of Christ. 
PHP.1.11	And you will be filled completely with the fruits of righteousness that are found in Jesus, the Anointed One—bringing great praise and glory to God!
PHP.1.12	I want you to know, dear ones, what has happened to me has not hindered, but helped my ministry of preaching the gospel, causing it to expand and spread to many people. 
PHP.1.13	For now the elite Roman guards and government officials overseeing my imprisonment have plainly recognized that I am here because of my love for the Anointed One. 
PHP.1.14	And what I’m going through has actually caused many believers to become even more courageous in the Lord and to be bold and passionate to preach the Word of God, all because of my chains.
PHP.1.15	It’s true that there are some who preach Christ out of competition and controversy, for they are jealous 
PHP.1.16	because they know I’ve been destined for the purpose of defending the revelation of God.
PHP.1.17	Those who preach Christ with ambition and competition are insincere—they just want to add to the hardships of my imprisonment. 
PHP.1.18	Yet in spite of all of this I am overjoyed! For what does it matter as long as Christ is being preached? If they preach him with mixed motives or with genuine love, the message of Christ is still being preached. 
PHP.1.19	because I know that the lavish supply of the Spirit of Jesus, the Anointed One, and your intercession for me will bring about my deliverance. 
PHP.1.20	No matter what, I will continue to hope and passionately cling to Christ, so that he will be openly revealed through me before everyone’s eyes. So I will not be ashamed! In my life or in my death, Christ will be magnified in me. 
PHP.1.21	My true life is the Anointed One, and dying means gaining more of him.
PHP.1.22+PHP.1.23+PHP.1.24	: Each day I live means bearing more fruit in my ministry; yet I fervently long to be liberated from this body and joined fully to Christ. That would suit me fine, but the greatest advantage to you would be that I remain alive. So you can see why I’m torn between the two—I don’t know which I prefer.
PHP.1.25	Yet deep in my heart I’m confident that I will be spared so I can add to your joy and further strengthen and mature your faith. 
PHP.1.26	When I am freed to come to you, my deliverance will give you a reason to boast even more in Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.27	Whatever happens, keep living your lives based on the reality of the gospel of Christ, 
PHP.1.28	And then you will never be shaken or intimidated by the opposition that rises up against us, for your courage will only prove as a sure sign from God of their coming destruction 
PHP.1.29	For God has graciously given you the privilege not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him. 
PHP.1.30	For you have been called by him to endure the conflict in the same way I have endured it—for you know I’m not giving up.
PHP.2.1	Look at how much encouragement you’ve found in your relationship with the Anointed One! You are filled to overflowing with his comforting love. You have experienced a deepening friendship with the Holy Spirit and have felt his tender affection and mercy.
PHP.2.2	So I’m asking you, my friends, that you be joined together in perfect unity—with one heart, one passion, and united in one love. Walk together with one harmonious purpose and you will fill my heart with unbounded joy.
PHP.2.3	Be free from pride-filled opinions, 
PHP.2.4	Abandon every display of selfishness. Possess a greater concern for what matters to others instead of your own interests. 
PHP.2.5	And consider the example that Jesus, the Anointed One, has set before us. Let his mindset become your motivation.
PHP.2.6	He existed in the form of God, yet he gave no thought to seizing equality with God as his supreme prize. 
PHP.2.7	Instead he emptied himself of his outward glory by reducing himself to the form of a lowly servant. He became human! 
PHP.2.8	He humbled himself and became vulnerable, choosing to be revealed as a man and was obedient. 
PHP.2.9	Because of that obedience, God exalted him and multiplied his greatness! He has now been given the greatest of all names!
PHP.2.10	The authority of the name of Jesus causes every knee to bow in reverence! Everything and everyone will one day submit to this name—in the heavenly realm, in the earthly realm, and in the demonic realm. 
PHP.2.11	And every tongue will proclaim in every language: “Jesus Christ is Lord Yahweh,” bringing glory and honor to God, his Father!
PHP.2.12	My beloved ones, just like you’ve always listened to everything I’ve taught you in the past, I’m asking you now to keep following my instructions as though I were right there with you. Now you must continue to make this new life fully manifested as you live in the holy awe of God—which brings you trembling into his presence. 
PHP.2.13	God will continually revitalize you, implanting within you the passion to do what pleases him.
PHP.2.14	Live a cheerful life, without complaining or division among yourselves. 
PHP.2.15	For then you will be seen as innocent, faultless, and pure children of God, even though you live in the midst of a brutal and perverse culture. For you will appear among them as shining lights in the universe, 
PHP.2.16	offering them the words of eternal life.
PHP.2.16	I haven’t labored among you for nothing, for 
PHP.2.17	But I will rejoice even if my life is poured out like a liquid offering to God over your sacrificial and surrendered lives of faith. 
PHP.2.18	And so no matter what happens to me, you should rejoice in ecstatic celebration with me!
PHP.2.19	Yet I’m trusting in our Lord Jesus that I may send Timothy to you soon, so I can be refreshed when I find out how you’re doing. 
PHP.2.20	Timothy is like no other. He carries the same passion for your welfare that I carry in my heart. 
PHP.2.21	For it seems as though everyone else is busy seeking what is best for themselves instead of the things that are most important to our Lord Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	You already know about his excellent reputation, since he has served alongside me as a loyal son in the work of ministry. 
PHP.2.23	After I see what transpires with me he’s the one I will send to you to bless you. 
PHP.2.24	And I’m trusting in my Lord to return to you in due time.
PHP.2.25	But for now, I feel a stirring in my heart to send Epaphroditus back to you immediately. He’s a friend to me and a wonderful brother and fellow soldier who has worked with me 
PHP.2.26	But now he is grieved to know that you found out he had been sick, so he longs to return and comfort you in this.
PHP.2.27	It’s true he almost died, but God showed him mercy and healed him. And I’m so thankful to God for his healing, as I was spared from having the sorrow of losing him on top of all my other troubles! 
PHP.2.28	So you can see why I’m delighted to send him to you now. I know that you’re anxious to see him and rejoice in his healing, and it encourages me to know how happy you’ll be to have him back.
PHP.2.29	So warmly welcome him home in the Lord, with joyous love, and esteem him highly, for people like him deserve it. 
PHP.2.30	Because of me, he put his life on the line, despising the danger, so that he could provide for me with what you couldn’t, since you were so far away. And he did it all because of his ministry for Christ.
PHP.3.1	My beloved ones, don’t ever limit your joy or fail to rejoice in the wonderful experience of knowing our Lord Jesus!
PHP.3.1	I don’t mind repeating what I’ve already written you because it protects you—
PHP.3.2	beware of those religious hypocrites who teach that you should be circumcised to please God. 
PHP.3.3	For we have already experienced “heart-circumcision,” and we worship God in the power and freedom of the Holy Spirit, 
PHP.3.4	It’s true that 
PHP.3.5	I was born a true Hebrew of the heritage of Israel as the son of a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin. I was circumcised eight days after my birth and 
PHP.3.6	And concerning the righteousness of the Torah, no one surpassed me; I was without a peer. Furthermore, as a fiery defender of the truth, I persecuted the messianic believers with religious zeal.
PHP.3.7	Yet all of the accomplishments that I once took credit for, I’ve now forsaken them and I regard it all as nothing compared to the delight of experiencing Jesus Christ as my Lord! 
PHP.3.8	To truly know him meant letting go of everything from my past and throwing all my boasting on the garbage heap. It’s all like a pile of manure to me now, so that I may be enriched in the reality of knowing Jesus Christ and embrace him as Lord in all of his greatness.
PHP.3.9	My passion is to be consumed with him and not clinging to my own “righteousness” based in keeping the written Law. My “righteousness” will be his, based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ—the very righteousness that comes from God. 
PHP.3.10	And I continually long to know the wonders of Jesus more fully and to experience the overflowing power of his resurrection working in me. I will be one with him in his sufferings and I will be one with him in his death. 
PHP.3.11	Only then will I be able to experience complete oneness with him in his resurrection from the realm of death.
PHP.3.12	I admit that I haven’t yet acquired the absolute fullness that I’m pursuing, but I run with passion 
PHP.3.13	I don’t depend on my own strength to accomplish this; however I do have one compelling focus: I forget all of the past as I fasten my heart to the future instead. 
PHP.3.14	I run straight for the divine invitation of reaching the heavenly goal and gaining the victory-prize through the anointing of Jesus. 
PHP.3.15	So let all who are fully mature have this same passion, and if anyone is not yet gripped by these desires, God will reveal it to them. 
PHP.3.16	And let us all advance together to reach this victory-prize, following one path with one passion.
PHP.3.17	My beloved friends, imitate my walk with God and follow all those who walk according to the way of life we modeled before you. 
PHP.3.18	For there are many who live by different standards. As I’ve warned you many times (I weep as I write these words), they are enemies of the cross of the Anointed One and 
PHP.3.19	doom awaits them. Their god has possessed them and made them mute. Their boast is in their shameful lifestyles and their minds are in the dirt.
PHP.3.20	But we are a colony of heaven on earth as we cling tightly to our life-giver, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
PHP.3.21	who will transform our humble bodies and transfigure us into the identical likeness of his glorified body. And using his matchless power, he continually subdues everything to himself.
PHP.4.1	My dear and precious friends, whom I deeply love, you have truly become my glorious joy and crown of reward. Now arise in the fullness of your union with our Lord.
PHP.4.2	And I plead with Euodia and Syntyche to settle their disagreement and be restored with one mind in our Lord. 
PHP.4.3	I would like my dear friend and burden-bearer to help resolve this issue, for both women have diligently labored with me for the prize and helped in spreading the revelation of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers. All of their names are written in the Book of Life.
PHP.4.4	Be cheerful with joyous celebration in every season of life. Let joy overflow, 
PHP.4.5	Let gentleness be seen in every relationship, for our Lord is ever near.
PHP.4.6	Don’t be pulled in different directions or worried about a thing. Be saturated in prayer throughout each day, offering your faith-filled requests before God with overflowing gratitude. Tell him every detail of your life, 
PHP.4.7	then God’s wonderful peace that transcends human understanding, 
PHP.4.8	So keep your thoughts continually fixed on all that is authentic and real, honorable and admirable, beautiful and respectful, pure and holy, merciful and kind. And fasten your thoughts on every glorious work of God, praising him always. 
PHP.4.9	 of all that we have imparted to you and the God of peace will be with you in all things.
PHP.4.10	My heart overflows with joy when I think of how you showed your love to me 
PHP.4.11	I’m not telling you this because I’m in need, for I have learned to be satisfied in any circumstance. 
PHP.4.12+PHP.4.13	I know what it means to lack, and I know what it means to experience overwhelming abundance. For I’m trained in the secret of overcoming all things, whether in fullness or in hunger. And I find that the strength of Christ’s explosive power infuses me to conquer every difficulty.
PHP.4.14	You’ve so graciously provided for my essential needs during this season of difficulty. 
PHP.4.15	For I want you to know that the Philippian church was the only church that supported me in the beginning as I went out to preach the gospel. You were the only church that sowed into me financially, 
PHP.4.16	and when I was in Thessalonica, you supported me for well over a year.
PHP.4.17	I mention this not because I’m requesting a gift, but so that the fruit of your generosity may bring you an abundant reward. 
PHP.4.18	I now have all I need—more than enough—I’m abundantly satisfied! For I’ve received the gift you sent by Epaphroditus and viewed it as a sweet sacrifice, perfumed with the fragrance 
PHP.4.19	I am convinced that my God will fully satisfy every need you have, 
PHP.4.20	And God our Father will receive all the glory and the honor throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!
PHP.4.21	Give my warm greetings to all the believers in the Anointed One, Jesus. 
PHP.4.22	All the brothers and sisters in Christ that are here with me send their loving greetings, especially the converts from Caesar’s household.
PHP.4.23	May every one of you overflow with the grace and favor of our Lord Jesus Christ!
COL.1.1+COL.1.2	 Paul and I have been chosen by Jesus Christ to be his apostle, by the calling and destined purpose of God. My colleague, Timothy, and I send this letter to all the holy believers who have been united to Jesus as beloved followers of the Messiah. May God, our true Father, release upon your lives the riches of his kind favor and heavenly peace through the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.
COL.1.3	Every time we pray for you our hearts overflow with thanksgiving to Father God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
COL.1.4	For we have heard of your devoted lives of faith in Christ Jesus and your tender love toward all his holy believers. 
COL.1.5	Your faith and love rise within you as you access all the treasures of your inheritance stored up in the heavenly realm. For the revelation of the true gospel is as real today as the day you first heard of our glorious hope, now that you have believed in the truth of the gospel.
COL.1.6	 is being spread everywhere, powerfully changing hearts throughout the earth, just like it has changed you! Every believer of this good news bears the fruit of eternal life as they experience the reality of God’s grace.
COL.1.7	Our beloved coworker, Epaphras, was there from the beginning to thoroughly teach you the astonishing revelation of the gospel, and he serves you faithfully as Christ’s representative. 
COL.1.8	He’s informed us of the many wonderful ways love is being demonstrated through your lives by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.
COL.1.9	Since we first heard about you, we’ve kept you always in our prayers that you would receive the perfect knowledge of God’s pleasure over your lives, making you reservoirs of every kind of wisdom and spiritual understanding. 
COL.1.10	We pray that you would walk in the ways of true righteousness, pleasing God in every good thing you do. Then you’ll become fruit-bearing branches, yielding to his life, and maturing in the rich experience of knowing God in his fullness! 
COL.1.11	And we pray that you would be energized with all his explosive power from the realm of his magnificent glory, filling you with great hope.
COL.1.12	 joyful gratitude when you think of how God made you worthy to receive the glorious inheritance freely given to us by living in the light. 
COL.1.13	He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved Son. 
COL.1.14	For in the Son all our sins are canceled and we have the release of redemption 
COL.1.15	He is the divine portrait, the true likeness of the invisible God, and the firstborn heir of all creation. 
COL.1.16	For in him was created the universe of things, both in the heavenly realm and on the earth, all that is seen and all that is unseen. Every seat of power, realm of government, principality, and authority—it all exists through him and for his purpose! 
COL.1.17	He existed before anything was made, and now everything finds completion in him.
COL.1.18	He is the Head of his body, which is the church. And since he is the beginning and the firstborn heir in resurrection, he is the most exalted One, holding first place in everything. 
COL.1.19	For God is satisfied to have all his fullness dwelling in Christ. 
COL.1.20	And by the blood of his cross, everything in heaven and earth is brought back to himself—
COL.1.21+COL.1.22	Even though you were once distant from him, living in the shadows of your evil thoughts and actions, he reconnected you back to himself. 
COL.1.23	if indeed you continue to advance in faith, assured of a firm foundation to grow upon. Never be shaken from the hope of the gospel you have believed in. And this is the glorious news I preach all over the world.
COL.1.24	I can even celebrate the sorrows I have experienced on your behalf; for as I join with you in your difficulties, it helps you to discover what lacks 
COL.1.25	This is the very reason I’ve been made a minister by the authority of God and a servant to his body, so that in his detailed plan I would fully equip you with the Word of God.
COL.1.26	There is a divine mystery—a secret surprise that has been concealed from the world for generations, but now it’s being revealed, unfolded and manifested for every holy believer to experience. 
COL.1.27	Living within you is the Christ who floods you with the expectation of glory! This mystery of Christ, embedded within us, becomes a heavenly treasure chest of hope filled with the riches of glory for his people, and God wants everyone to know it!
COL.1.28+COL.1.29	Christ is our message! We preach to awaken hearts and bring every person into the full understanding of truth. It has become my inspiration and passion in ministry to labor with a tireless intensity, with his power flowing through me, to present to every believer the revelation of being his perfect one in Jesus Christ.
COL.2.1	I wish you could know how much I have struggled for you and for the church in Laodicea, and for the many other friends I’ve yet to meet. 
COL.2.2	I am contending for you that your hearts will be wrapped in the comfort of heaven and woven together into love’s fabric. This will give you access to all the riches of God as you experience the revelation of God’s great mystery—Christ.
COL.2.3	For our spiritual wealth is in him, like hidden treasure waiting to be discovered—heaven’s wisdom and endless riches of revelation knowledge.
COL.2.4	I want you to know this so that no one will come and lead you into error through their persuasive arguments and clever words. 
COL.2.5	Even though I’m separated from you geographically, my spirit is present there with you. And I’m overjoyed to see how disciplined and deeply committed you are because you have such a solid faith in Christ, the Anointed One.
COL.2.6	In the same way you received Jesus our Lord and Messiah by faith, continue your journey of faith, progressing further into your union with him! 
COL.2.7	Your spiritual roots go deeply into his life as you are continually infused with strength, encouraged in every way. For you are established in the faith you have absorbed and enriched by your devotion to him!
COL.2.8	Beware that no one distracts you or intimidates you 
COL.2.9	For he is the complete fullness of deity living in human form. 
COL.2.10	And our own completeness is now found in him. We are completely filled 
COL.2.11	Through our union with him we have experienced circumcision of heart. All of the guilt and power of sin has been cut away and is now extinct because of what Christ, the Anointed One, has accomplished for us.
COL.2.12	For we’ve been buried with him into his death. Our “baptism into death” also means we were raised with him when we believed in God’s resurrection power, the power that raised him from death’s realm. 
COL.2.13	This “realm of death” describes our former state, for we were held in sin’s grasp. But now, we’ve been resurrected out of that “realm of death” never to return, for we are forever alive and forgiven of all our sins!
COL.2.14	He canceled out every legal violation we had on our record and the old arrest warrant that stood to indict us. He erased it all—our sins, our stained soul—he deleted it all 
COL.2.15	Then Jesus made a public spectacle of all the powers and principalities of darkness, stripping away from them every weapon and all their spiritual authority and power to accuse us. And by the power of the cross, Jesus led them around as prisoners in a procession of triumph. 
COL.2.16	So why would you allow anyone to judge you because of what you eat or drink, or insist that you keep the feasts, observe new moon celebrations, or the Sabbath? 
COL.2.17	All of these were but a prophetic shadow and the evidence of what would be fulfilled, for the body is now Christ!
COL.2.18	Don’t let anyone disqualify you from your prize! Don’t let their pretended sincerity fool you as they deliberately lead you into their initiation of angel worship. For they take pleasure in pretending to be experts of something they know nothing about. Their reasoning is meaningless and comes only from their own opinions. 
COL.2.19	They refuse to take hold of the true source.
COL.2.19	, and his life supplies vitality into every part of his body through the joining ligaments connecting us all as one. 
COL.2.20	For you were included in the death of Christ and have died with him to the religious system and powers of this world. Don’t retreat back to being bullied by the standards and opinions of religion—
COL.2.21	, “You can’t associate with that person!” or, “Don’t eat that!” or, “You can’t touch that!” 
COL.2.22	These are the doctrines of men and corrupt customs that are worthless to help you spiritually. 
COL.2.23	For though they may appear to possess the promise of wisdom in their submission to God through the deprivation of their physical bodies, it is actually nothing more than empty rules rooted in religious rituals!
COL.3.1	Christ’s resurrection is your resurrection too. This is why we are to yearn for all that is above, for that’s where Christ sits enthroned at the place of all power, honor, and authority! 
COL.3.2	Yes, 
COL.3.3	Your crucifixion with Christ has severed the tie to this life, and now your true life is hidden away in God in Christ. 
COL.3.4	And as Christ himself is seen for who he really is, who you really are will also be revealed, for you are now one with him in his glory!
COL.3.5	Live as one who has died to every form of sexual sin and impurity. Live as one who died to diseases, and desires for forbidden things, including the desire for wealth, which is the essence of idol worship. 
COL.3.6	When you live in these vices you ignite the anger of God against these acts of disobedience.
COL.3.7+COL.3.8	That’s how you once behaved, characterized by your evil deeds. But now it’s time to eliminate them from your lives once and for all—anger, fits of rage, all forms of hatred, cursing, filthy speech, 
COL.3.9	and lying. Lay aside your old Adam-self with its masquerade and disguise.
COL.3.10	For you have acquired new creation life which is continually being renewed into the likeness of the One who created you; giving you the full revelation of God. 
COL.3.11	In this new creation life, your nationality makes no difference, or your ethnicity, education, or economic status—
COL.3.12	You are always and dearly loved by God! So robe yourself 
COL.3.13	Tolerate the weaknesses of those in the family of faith, forgiving one another in the same way you have been graciously forgiven by Jesus Christ. If you find fault with someone, release this same gift of forgiveness to them. 
COL.3.14	For love is supreme and must flow through each of these virtues. Love becomes the mark of true maturity.
COL.3.15	Let your heart be always guided by the peace of the Anointed One, who called you to peace as part of his one body. And always be thankful.
COL.3.16	Let the word of Christ live in you richly, flooding you with all wisdom. 
COL.3.17	Let every activity of your lives and every word that comes from your lips be drenched with the beauty of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. And bring your constant praise to God the Father 
COL.3.18	Let every wife be supportive and tenderly devoted to her husband, 
COL.3.19	Let every husband be filled with cherishing love for his wife and never be insensitive toward her.
COL.3.20	Let the children respect and pay attention to their parents in everything for this pleases our Lord Jesus. 
COL.3.21	And fathers, don’t have unrealistic expectations for your children or else they may become discouraged.
COL.3.22	Let every employee listen well and follow the instructions of their employer, not just when their employers are watching, and not in pretense, but faithful in all things. For we are to live our lives with pure hearts in the constant awe and wonder of our Lord God.
COL.3.23	Put your heart and soul into every activity you do, as though you are doing it for the Lord himself and not merely for others.
COL.3.24	For we know that we will receive a reward, an inheritance from the Lord, as we serve the Lord Yahweh, the Anointed One! 
COL.3.25	A disciple will be repaid for what he has learned and followed, for God pays no attention to the titles or prestige of men.
COL.4.1	Employers, treat your workers with equality and justice as you know that you also have a Lord and Master in heaven 
COL.4.2	Be faithful to pray as intercessors who are fully alert and giving thanks 
COL.4.3	And please pray for me, that God will open a door of opportunity for us to preach the revelation of the mystery of Christ, for whose sake I am imprisoned. 
COL.4.4	Pray that I would unfold and reveal fully this mystery, for that is my delightful assignment.
COL.4.5	Walk in the wisdom of God as you live before the unbelievers, and make it your duty to make him known. 
COL.4.6	Let every word you speak be drenched with grace and tempered with truth and clarity. For then you will be prepared to give a respectful answer to anyone who asks about your faith.
COL.4.7+COL.4.8	Tychicus will tell you about what is happening with me. I have sent him to you so that he could find out how you are doing in your journey of faith, and bring comfort and encouragement to your hearts. For he is a beloved brother in Christ, a faithful servant of the gospel and my ministry partner in our Master Yahweh’s work.
COL.4.9	I have also sent Onesimus, who is from your city, and is also a beloved and faithful brother who will inform you of all that we’re enduring.
COL.4.10+COL.4.11	Aristarchus, a fellow prisoner here with me, sends you his love. And Joshua (who is also called Justus) along with Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, also send you their loving greetings. You have already been informed that if Mark comes to you, receive him warmly. These three men are the only ones of the circumcision who have aided me here in the work of the kingdom of God, and they have been a great blessing to me.
COL.4.12+COL.4.13	Epaphras, who is also from Colossae, sends his loving greetings. I can tell you that he is a true servant of Christ, who always labors and intercedes for you. His prayers are filled with requests to God that you would grow and mature, standing complete and perfect in the beauty of God’s plan for your lives. Epaphras has such great zeal and passion for you and for those who are from Laodicea and from Hierapolis.
COL.4.14	And Luke, the beloved physician, sends his warm greetings to you, and Demas also. 
COL.4.15	Give my greetings to all the believers in Laodicea. And pray for dear Nymphas and the church that gathers in her home.
COL.4.16	Once you’ve read this letter publicly to the church, please send it on to the church of the Laodiceans, and make sure you read the letter that I wrote to them. 
COL.4.17	Be sure you give Archippus this message: “Be faithful to complete the ministry you received from our Lord Jesus!”
COL.4.18	Now finally, I, Paul, write this with my own handwriting, and I send my loving greetings to you! Remember me in my imprisonment. May the blessings of God’s grace overwhelm you!
1TH.1.1	From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. We send our greetings to you, the congregation of believers in Thessalonica, which is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May God’s delightful grace and peace rest upon you.
1TH.1.2	We are grateful to God for your lives and we always pray for you. 
1TH.1.3	For we remember before our God and Father how you put your faith into practice, how your love motivates you to serve others, and how unrelenting is your hope-filled patience in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.4	Dear brothers and sisters, you are dearly loved by God and we know that he has chosen you to be his very own. 
1TH.1.5	For our gospel came to you not merely in the form of words but in mighty power infused with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. Surely you remember how we lived our lives transparently before you to encourage you.
1TH.1.6	And you became followers of my example and the Lord’s when you received the word with the joy of the Holy Spirit, even though it resulted in tremendous trials and persecution. 
1TH.1.7	Now you have become an example for all the believers to follow throughout the provinces of Greece.
1TH.1.8	The message of the Lord has sounded out from you not only in Greece, but its echo has been heard in every place where people are hearing about your strong faith. We don’t need to brag on you, 
1TH.1.9	for everyone tells the story of the kind of welcome you showed us when we first came to you. And everyone knows how wonderfully you turned to God from idols to serve the true and living God. 
1TH.1.10	And now you eagerly expect his Son from heaven—Jesus, the deliverer, whom he raised from the dead and who rescues us from the coming wrath.
1TH.2.1	My dear brothers and sisters, it’s obvious that our ministry among you has proven to be fruitful. 
1TH.2.2	And though we had already suffered greatly in Philippi, where we were shamefully mistreated, we were emboldened 
1TH.2.3	Our coming alongside you to encourage you was not out of some delusion, or impure motive, or an intention to mislead you, 
1TH.2.4	but we have been approved by God to be those who preach the gospel. So our motivation to preach is not pleasing people but pleasing God, who thoroughly examines our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	God is our witness that when we came to encourage you, we never once used cunning compliments as a pretext for greed, 
1TH.2.6	nor did we crave the praises of men, whether you or others. 
1TH.2.7	Even though we could have imposed upon you our demands as apostles of Christ, instead we showed you kindness and were gentle among you. We cared for you in the same way a nursing mother cares for her own children. 
1TH.2.8	With a mother’s love and affectionate attachment to you, we were very happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our lives—because you had become so dear to us.
1TH.2.9	Beloved brothers and sisters, surely you remember how hard we labored among you. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to you while we preached the wonderful gospel of God. 
1TH.2.10	With God as our witness you saw how we lived among you—in holiness, in godly relationships, and without fault. 
1TH.2.11	And you know how affectionately we treated each one of you, like a loving father cares for his own children. 
1TH.2.12	We comforted and encouraged you and challenged you to adopt a lifestyle worthy of God, who invites you into his kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	This is why we continually thank God 
1TH.2.14	 brothers and sisters, the same thing happened to you as happened to God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you received the same kind of mistreatment from your fellow countrymen as they did from theirs, the Jews 
1TH.2.15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and ran us out of town. They are offending God and hostile to everyone else 
1TH.2.16	by hindering us from speaking to the unbelievers so that they might be saved. By so doing they are constantly filling up to the brim the measure of their guilt, and punishment has come upon them at last!
1TH.2.17	Beloved friends, we may have been torn away from you physically for a season, but never in our hearts. For we have had intense longings and have endeavored to come and see in your faces the reflection of this great love. 
1TH.2.18	We 
1TH.2.19	For what will be our 
1TH.2.20	Yes, you are our glorious 
1TH.3.1	When we could bear it no longer, we decided that we would remain in Athens 
1TH.3.2	and send Timothy 
1TH.3.3	so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions, for you know that we are destined for this. 
1TH.3.4	In fact, when we were with you we forewarned you: “Suffering and persecution is coming.” And so it has happened, as you well know. 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I sent 
1TH.3.6	But now, Timothy has just returned to us and brought us the terrific news of your faith and love. He informed us that you still hold us dear in your hearts and that you long to see us as much as we long to see you. 
1TH.3.7	So, our dear brothers and sisters, in the midst of all our distress and difficulties, your steadfastness of faith has greatly encouraged our hearts. 
1TH.3.8	We feel alive again as long as we know that you are standing firm in the Lord.
1TH.3.9	How could we ever thank God enough for all the wonderful joy that we feel before our God because of you? 
1TH.3.10	Every night and day we sincerely and fervently pray that we may see you face-to-face and furnish you with whatever may be lacking in your faith.
1TH.3.11	Now may our Father God and our precious Lord Jesus guide our steps on a path straight back to you. 
1TH.3.12	And may the Lord increase your love until it overflows toward one another and for all people, just as our love overflows toward you. 
1TH.3.13	Then your hearts will be strengthened in holiness so that you may be flawless and pure before 
1TH.4.1	And now, 
1TH.4.2	For you already know the instructions we’ve shared with you through the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	God’s will is for you to be set apart for him in holiness and that you keep yourselves 
1TH.4.4	Yes, each of you must guard your sexual purity with holiness and dignity, 
1TH.4.5	not yielding to lustful passions like those who don’t know God. 
1TH.4.6	Never take selfish advantage of a brother or sister in this matter, for we’ve already told you and solemnly warned you that the Lord is the avenger in all these things. 
1TH.4.7	For God’s call on our lives is not to a life of 
1TH.4.8	Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction isn’t rejecting human authority but God himself, who gives 
1TH.4.9	There’s no need for anyone to say much to you about loving your fellow believers, for God is continually teaching you to unselfishly love one another. 
1TH.4.10	Indeed, your love is what you’re known for throughout Macedonia. We urge you, beloved ones, to let this unselfish love increase 
1TH.4.11	Aspire to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mind your own business and earn your living, just as we’ve taught you. 
1TH.4.12	By doing this you will live an honorable life, influencing others and commanding respect of even the unbelievers. Then you’ll be in need of nothing and not dependent upon others.
1TH.4.13	Beloved brothers and sisters, we want you to be quite certain about the truth concerning those who have passed away, so that you won’t be overwhelmed with grief like many others who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who died while believing in him. 
1TH.4.15	This is the word of the Lord: we who are alive 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself will appear with the declaration of victory, the shout of an archangel, and the trumpet blast of God. He will descend from the heavenly realm and 
1TH.4.17	Then we who are alive will join them, transported together in clouds to have an encounter with the Lord in the air, and we will be forever joined with the Lord. 
1TH.4.18	So encourage one another with these truths.
1TH.5.1	Now, beloved brothers and sisters, concerning the question of 
1TH.5.2	For you already know quite well that the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly and as a complete surprise. 
1TH.5.3	For while some are saying, “Finally we have peace and security,” sudden destruction will arrive at their doorstep, like labor pains seizing a pregnant woman—and with no chance of escape!
1TH.5.4	But you, beloved brothers and sisters, are not living in the dark, allowing that day to creep up on you like a thief 
1TH.5.5	For you are all children of the light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night nor to darkness. 
1TH.5.6	This is why we must not fall asleep, as the rest do, but keep wide awake and clearheaded. 
1TH.5.7	For those who are asleep sleep the night away, and drunkards get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But since we belong to the day, we must stay alert and clearheaded by placing the breastplate of faith and love 
1TH.5.9	For God has not destined us to experience wrath but to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. 
1TH.5.10	He gave his life for us so that we may share in resurrection life in union with him—whether we’re awake or asleep. 
1TH.5.11	Because of this, encourage the hearts of your fellow believers and support one another, just as you have already been doing.
1TH.5.12	Dear brothers and sisters, make sure that you show your deep appreciation for those who cherish you and diligently work as ministers among you. For they are your leaders who care for you, teach you, and stand before the Lord on your behalf. 
1TH.5.13	They value you with great love. Because of their service to you, let peace reign among yourselves.
1TH.5.14	We appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, to instruct those who are not in their place of battle. 
1TH.5.15	Resist revenge, and make sure that no one pays back evil in place of evil but always pursue doing what is beautiful to one another and to all 
1TH.5.16	Let joy be your continual feast. 
1TH.5.17	Make your life a prayer. 
1TH.5.18	And in the midst of everything be always giving thanks, for this is God’s perfect plan for you in Christ Jesus.
1TH.5.19	Never 
1TH.5.20	And don’t be one who scorns prophecies, 
1TH.5.21	but be faithful to examine them by putting them to the test, and afterward hold tightly to what has proven to be right. 
1TH.5.22	Avoid every appearance of evil.
1TH.5.23	Now, may the God of peace and harmony set you apart, making you completely holy. And may your entire being—spirit, soul, and body—be kept completely flawless in the appearing of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. 
1TH.5.24	The one who calls you by name is trustworthy and will thoroughly complete his work in you.
1TH.5.25	Now, beloved ones, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet every brother and sister with a sacred kiss.
1TH.5.27	I solemnly plead with you before the Lord to make sure that every holy believer among you has the opportunity to hear this letter read to them.
1TH.5.28	May grace from our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen!
2TH.1.1	From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. 
2TH.1.2	May God’s delightful grace and peace rest upon you.
2TH.1.3	We feel a personal responsibility to continually be thanking God for you, our spiritual family, every time we pray. And we have every reason to do so because your faith is growing marvelously beyond measure. The unselfish love each of you share for one another is increasing and overflowing! 
2TH.1.4	 unwavering faith for all the churches of God. We boast about how you continue to demonstrate unflinching endurance through all the persecutions and painful trials you are experiencing. 
2TH.1.5	All of this proves that God’s judgment is always perfect and is intended to make you worthy of 
2TH.1.6	It is right and just for God to trouble your troublers 
2TH.1.7	and give rest to the troubled, both to you and to us, at the unveiling of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his messengers of power 
2TH.1.8	within a flame of fire. He will bring perfect and full justice to those who don’t know God and on those who refuse to embrace the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
2TH.1.9	They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction, banished from the Lord’s presence and from the manifestation of his glorious power. 
2TH.1.10	 on that day when he glorifies his holy ones, and they will be marveled at among all believers—including you, since in fact, you believed our message.
2TH.1.11	With this in mind, we constantly pray that our God will empower you to live worthy of all that he has invited you to experience. And we pray that by his power all the pleasures of goodness and all works inspired by faith would fill you completely. 
2TH.1.12	By doing this the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you will be glorified in him, by the 
2TH.2.1	Now, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we plead with you, beloved friends, 
2TH.2.2	not to be easily confused or disturbed in your minds by any kind of spirit, rumor, or letter allegedly from us, claiming that the day of the Lord has already come. 
2TH.2.3	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. Before that day comes the rebellion must occur and the “outlaw”—the destructive son—will be revealed 
2TH.2.4	He is the opposing counterpart who exalts himself over everything that is called “God” or is worshiped and who sits enthroned in God’s temple and makes himself out to be a god. 
2TH.2.5	Don’t you remember that when I was with you I went over all these things?
2TH.2.6	Now you are aware of the ruling power so that he may be fully revealed when his time comes. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness is already active, but the one who prevails will do so until he is separated from out of the midst. 
2TH.2.8	Then the “outlaw” will be openly revealed, and the Lord will overthrow him by the breath of his mouth and bring him to an end by the dazzling manifestation of his presence.
2TH.2.9	The presence of the “outlaw” is apparent by the activity of Satan, who uses all kinds of 
2TH.2.10	and every form of evil deception in order to deceive those who are perishing because they rejected the love of the truth that would lead them to being saved. 
2TH.2.11	Because of this, God sends them a powerful delusion that leads them to believe what is false. 
2TH.2.12	So then all who found their pleasure in unrighteousness and did not believe the truth will be judged.
2TH.2.13	We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, for you are 
2TH.2.14	To this end he handpicked you for salvation through the gospel so that you would have the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.15	So then, dear family, stand firm with a masterful grip of the teachings we gave you, either by word of mouth or by our letter.
2TH.2.16	Now may the Lord Jesus Christ and our Father God, who loved us and in his wonderful grace gave us eternal comfort and a beautiful hope that cannot fail, 
2TH.2.17	encourage your hearts and inspire you with strength to always do and speak what is good and beautiful 
2TH.3.1	Finally, dear brothers and sisters, pray for us that the Lord’s message will continue to spread rapidly and its glory be recognized everywhere, just as it was with you. 
2TH.3.2	And pray that God will rescue us from wicked and evil people, for not everyone believes 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord Yahweh is always faithful to place you on a firm foundation and guard you from the Evil One. 
2TH.3.4	We have complete confidence in the Lord concerning you and we are sure that you are doing and will continue to do what we have told you.
2TH.3.5	Now may the Lord move your hearts into 
2TH.3.6	Beloved brothers and sisters, we instruct you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to stay away from believers who are unruly and who stray from all that we have taught you. 
2TH.3.7	For you know very well that you should order your lives after our example, because we were not undisciplined when we were with you. 
2TH.3.8	We didn’t sponge off of you, but we worked hard night and day to provide our own food and lodging and not be a burden to any of you. 
2TH.3.9	It wasn’t because we don’t have the right to be supported, but we wanted to provide you an example to follow. 
2TH.3.10	For when we were with you we instructed you with these words: “Anyone who does not want to work for a living should go hungry.”
2TH.3.11	Now, we hear rumors that some of you are being lazy and neglecting to work—that these people are not busy but busybodies! 
2TH.3.12	So with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, we order them to go back to work in an orderly fashion and exhort them to earn their own living. 
2TH.3.13	Brothers and sisters, don’t ever grow weary in doing what is right.
2TH.3.14	Take special note of anyone who won’t obey what we have written and stay away from them, so that they would be ashamed and get turned around. 
2TH.3.15	Yet don’t regard them as enemies, but caution them as fellow believers.
2TH.3.16	Now, may the Lord himself, the Lord of peace, pour into you his peace in every circumstance and in every possible way. The Lord’s 
2TH.3.17+2TH.3.18	So now, in my own handwriting, I add these words:
2TH.3.17+2TH.3.18	Loving greetings to each of you. And may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
2TH.3.17+2TH.3.18	Paul
2TH.3.17+2TH.3.18	The above is my signature and the token of authenticity in every letter I write.
1TI.1.1	From Paul, an apostle in Christ Jesus, for it was Jesus himself, our living hope, who sent me as his servant by the command of God, our life-giver.
1TI.1.2	Timothy, you are my true spiritual son in the faith. May abundant grace, mercy, and total well-being from God the Father and the Anointed One, our Lord Jesus, be yours!
1TI.1.3	As I urged you when I left for Macedonia, I’m asking that you remain in Ephesus to instruct them not to teach or follow the error of deceptive doctrines, 
1TI.1.4	nor pay any attention to cultural myths, traditions, or the endless study of genealogies. Those digressions only breed controversies and debates. They are devoid of power that builds up and strengthens the church in the faith of God.
1TI.1.5	For we reach the goal of fulfilling all the commandments when we love others deeply with a pure heart, a clean conscience, and sincere faith. 
1TI.1.6	Some believers have been led astray by teachings and speculations that emphasize nothing more than the empty words of men. 
1TI.1.7	They presume to be expert teachers of the law, but they don’t have the slightest idea of what they’re talking about and they simply love to argue!
1TI.1.8	We know that the moral code of the law is beautiful when applied as God intended, 
1TI.1.9	but actually, the law was not established for righteous people, but to bring conviction of sin to the unrighteous. The law was established to bring the revelation of sin to the evildoers and rebellious, the sinners without God, those who are vicious and perverse, and to those who strike their father or their mother, sinners, murderers, 
1TI.1.10	rapists, those who are sexually impure, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, those who break their oaths, and all those who oppose the teaching of godliness and purity in the church! 
1TI.1.11	I have been commissioned to preach the wonderful news of the glory of the exalted God. 
1TI.1.12	My heart spills over with thanks to God for the way he continually empowers me, and to our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, who found me trustworthy and who authorized me to be his partner in this ministry.
1TI.1.13	Mercy kissed me, even though I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor of believers, and a scorner of what turned out to be true. I was ignorant and didn’t know what I was doing. 
1TI.1.14	I was flooded with such incredible grace, 
1TI.1.15	I can testify that the Word is true and deserves to be received by all, for Jesus Christ came into the world to bring sinners back to life—even me, the worst sinner of all! 
1TI.1.16	Yet I was captured by grace, so that Jesus Christ could display through me the outpouring of his Spirit as a pattern to be seen for all those who would believe in him for eternal life.
1TI.1.17	Because of this my praises rise to the King of all the universe who is indestructible, invisible, and full of glory, the only God who is worthy of the highest honors throughout all of time and throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!
1TI.1.18+1TI.1.19	So Timothy, my son, I am entrusting you with this responsibility, in keeping with the very first prophecies that were spoken over your life, and are now in the process of fulfillment in this great work of ministry, in keeping with the prophecies spoken over you. With this encouragement 
1TI.1.20	such as Hymenaeus and Alexander who have fallen away. I have delivered them both over to Satan to be rid of them and to teach them to no longer blaspheme!
1TI.2.1	Most of all, I’m writing to encourage you to pray with gratitude to God. Pray for all men with all forms of prayers and requests as you intercede with intense passion. 
1TI.2.2	And pray for every political leader and representative, so that we would be able to live tranquil, undisturbed lives, as we worship the awe-inspiring God with pure hearts. 
1TI.2.3	It is pleasing to our Savior-God 
1TI.2.4	He longs for everyone to embrace his life and return to the full knowledge of the truth.
1TI.2.5	For God is one, and there is one Mediator between God and the sons of men—the true man, Jesus, the Anointed One. 
1TI.2.6	He gave himself as ransom-payment for everyone. Now is the proper time for God to give the world this witness. 
1TI.2.7	I have been divinely called as an apostle to preach this revelation, which is the truth. God has called me to be a trustworthy teacher to the nations.
1TI.2.8	Therefore, I encourage the men to pray on every occasion with hands lifted to God in worship with clean hearts, free from frustration or strife.
1TI.2.9	And that the women 
1TI.2.10	But 
1TI.2.11	Let the women 
1TI.2.12	I don’t advocate that the 
1TI.2.13	For God formed Adam first, then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	Adam did not mislead Eve, but Eve misled him and violated the command of God. 
1TI.2.15	Yet a woman shall live in restored dignity by means of her children, receiving the blessing that comes from raising them as consecrated children nurtured in faith and love, walking in wisdom.
1TI.3.1	If any of you aspires to be an overseer in the church; you have set your heart toward a noble ambition, for the word is true! 
1TI.3.2	Yet an elder needs to be one who is without blame before others.
1TI.3.2	He should be one whose heart is for his wife alone 
1TI.3.3	He cannot be a drunkard, or someone who lashes out at others, or argumentative, or someone who simply craves more money, but instead, recognized by his gentleness.
1TI.3.4	His heart should be set on guiding his household with wisdom and dignity; bringing up his children to worship with devotion and purity. 
1TI.3.5	For if he’s unable to properly lead his own household well, how could he properly lead God’s household?
1TI.3.6	He should not be a new disciple who would be vulnerable to living in the clouds of conceit and fall into pride, making him easy prey for Satan. 
1TI.3.7	He should be respected by those who are unbelievers, having a beautiful testimony among them so that he will not fall into the traps of Satan and be disgraced.
1TI.3.8	And in the same way the deacons must be those who are pure and true to their word, not addicted to wine, or with greedy eyes on the contributions. 
1TI.3.9	Instead, they must faithfully embrace the mysteries of faith while keeping a clean conscience. 
1TI.3.10	And each of them must be found trustworthy according to these standards before they are given the responsibility to minister as servant-leaders without blame.
1TI.3.11	And the women also who serve the church should be dignified, faithful in all things, having their thoughts set on truth, and not known as those who gossip.
1TI.3.12	A deacon’s heart must be toward his wife alone, leading his children and household with excellence. 
1TI.3.13	For those who serve in this way will obtain an honorable reputation for themselves and a greater right to speak boldly in the faith that comes from the anointing of Jesus!
1TI.3.14	I’m writing all this with the expectation of seeing you soon. 
1TI.3.15	But if I’m delayed in coming, you’ll already have these instructions on how to conduct the affairs of the church of the living God, his very household and the supporting pillar and firm foundation of the truth.
1TI.3.16	For the mystery of righteousness is truly amazing!
1TI.3.16	He was revealed as a human being,
1TI.3.16	and as our great High Priest in the Spirit!
1TI.3.16	Angels gazed upon him 
1TI.3.16	and the glorious message of his kingly rulership
1TI.3.16	is being preached to the nations!
1TI.3.16	Many have believed in him
1TI.3.16	and he has been taken back to heaven,
1TI.3.16	and has ascended into the place of exalted glory
1TI.3.16	.
1TI.3.16	Yes, great is this mystery of righteousness!
1TI.4.1	The Holy Spirit has explicitly revealed: At the end of this age, many will depart from the true faith one after another, devoting themselves to spirits of deception and following demon-inspired revelations and theories. 
1TI.4.2	Hypocritical liars will deceive many, and their consciences won’t bother them at all! 
1TI.4.3	They will require celibacy and dietary restrictions that God doesn’t expect, for he created all foods to be received with the celebration of faith by those who fully know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	We know that all creation is beautiful to God and there is nothing to be refused if it is received with gratitude. 
1TI.4.5	All that we eat is made sacred by the Word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If you will teach the believers these things, you will be known as a faithful and good minister of Jesus, the Anointed One. Nurture others in the living words of faith and in the knowledge of grace which you were taught.
1TI.4.7	Be quick to abstain from senseless traditions and legends, but instead be engaged in the training of truth that brings righteousness.
1TI.4.8	For athletic training only benefits you for a short season, but righteousness brings lasting benefit in everything; for righteousness contains the promise of life, for time and eternity. 
1TI.4.9	Faithful is the Word, and everyone should accept him!
1TI.4.10	For the sake of this ministry, we toil tirelessly and are criticized continually, simply because our hope is in the living God. He is the wonderful life-giver of all the children of men, and even more so to those who believe.
1TI.4.11	Instruct and teach the people all that I’ve taught you. 
1TI.4.12	And don’t be intimidated by those who are older than you; simply be the example they need to see by being faithful and true in all that you do. Speak the truth and live a life of purity and authentic love as you remain strong in your faith.
1TI.4.13	So until I come, be diligent in devouring the Word of God, be faithful in prayer, and in teaching the believers.
1TI.4.14	Don’t minimize the powerful gift that operates in your life, for it was imparted to you by the laying on of hands of the elders and was activated through the prophecy they spoke over you. 
1TI.4.15	Make all of this your constant meditation and make it real with your life so everyone can see that you are moving forward. 
1TI.4.16	Give careful attention to your spiritual life and every cherished truth you teach, for living what you preach will then release even more abundant life inside you and to all those who listen to you.
1TI.5.1	Don’t be harsh or verbally abusive to an older man; it is better to appeal to him as a father. And as you minister to the younger men it is best to encourage them as your dear brothers. 
1TI.5.2	Honor the older women as mothers, and the younger women, treat as your dear sisters with utmost purity.
1TI.5.3	The church needs to honor and support the widows, especially those who are in dire need. 
1TI.5.4	But if they have children or grandchildren at home, then it is only proper to let them provide for the ones who raised them when they were children, for kindness begins at home and it pleases God.
1TI.5.5	For the true widow is all alone and has placed her complete hope in God. She is Messiah’s missionary 
1TI.5.6	But the widow who serves only herself lives a life of self-indulgence and is wasting her life away.
1TI.5.7	Be sure to give clear instruction concerning these matters so that none of them will live with shame. 
1TI.5.8	For if a believer fails to provide for their own relatives when they are in need, they have compromised their convictions of faith 
1TI.5.9	The widows who are worthy to be supported by the church should be at least sixty years old and not remarried. 
1TI.5.10	They should have a beautiful testimony of raising their families, practicing hospitality, encouraging other believers, comforting troubled ones, and have a reputation for doing good works.
1TI.5.11	But you need not concern yourself with the younger widows, for some will depart from the Messiah because of their desire to remarry. 
1TI.5.12	For they will face their own punishment of living with a disturbed conscience for invalidating their former faith. 
1TI.5.13	Those widows who go around from house to house as busybodies are only learning to be lazy, making their situation even worse by talking too much, gossiping, and speaking things they shouldn’t. They become far too obsessed with empty things that will not bear good fruit.
1TI.5.14	For this reason, teach the younger women to remarry and bear children and care for their household. This will keep them from giving our adversary a reason to gloat. 
1TI.5.15	For there are already those who have begun to turn aside from their faith and are influenced by Satan.
1TI.5.16	So if any believer has a widow in their family, instruct them to support her financially so that the church will not be burdened with her care. This will leave finances available for those widows who are truly in need.
1TI.5.17	The pastors who lead the church well should be paid well. They should receive double honor for faithfully preaching and teaching the revelation of the Word of God. 
1TI.5.18	For the Scriptures have taught us: “Do not muzzle an ox or forbid it to eat while it grinds the grain.” And also, “The one who labors deserves his wages.”
1TI.5.19	Refuse to listen to suspicious accusations against the pastors who lead the flock unless you have two or three witnesses 
1TI.5.20	But if indeed you find that they have sinned, bring correction to them before the congregation so that the rest of the people will respect you.
1TI.5.21	Timothy, in the presence of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and before the chosen messengers, I solemnly charge you to put into practice all these matters without bias, prejudice, or favoritism.
1TI.5.22	Don’t be hasty to ordain them with the laying on of hands, or you may end up sharing in their guilt should they fall. Keep yourself pure and holy with your standards high. 
1TI.5.23	(If drinking the water causes you to have stomach ailments, drink some wine instead.)
1TI.5.24	The sins of some people stand out and are well known. Yet there are others whose sins are not as obvious, but the truth of who they really are will eventually be seen and will bring them judgment. 
1TI.5.25	It is the same way with good works, even if they are not known at first, they will eventually be recognized and acknowledged.
1TI.6.1	Instruct every employee to respect and honor their employers, for this attitude presents to them a clear testimony of God’s truth and renown. Tell them to never provide them with a reason to discredit God’s name because of their actions. 
1TI.6.2	Especially honor and respect employers who are believers and don’t despise them, but serve them all the more, for they are fellow believers. They should be at peace with them as beloved members of God’s family. Be faithful to teach them these things as their sacred obligation.
1TI.6.3	But if anyone spreads false teaching that does not agree with the healthy instruction of our Lord Jesus, teaching others that holy awe of God is not important, then they prove they know nothing at all! It’s obvious they don’t value or hold dear the healing words of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TI.6.4	They are covered with the clouds of conceit. They are loaded with controversy, and they love to argue their opinions and split hairs. The fruit of their ministry is contention, competition, and evil suspicions.
1TI.6.5	They add misery to many lives by corrupting their minds and cheating them of the truth. They equate the worship of God with making great sums of money.
1TI.6.6	We have a “profit” that is greater than theirs—our holy awe of God! To have merely our necessities is to have enough.
1TI.6.7	Isn’t it true that our hands were empty when we came into the world, and when we leave this world our hands will be empty again?
1TI.6.8	Because of this, food and clothing is enough to make us content.
1TI.6.9	But those who crave the wealth of this world slip into spiritual snares. They become trapped by the troubles that come through their foolish and harmful desires, driven by greed and drowning in their own sinful pleasures. And they take others down with them into their corruption and eventual destruction.
1TI.6.10	Loving money is the first step toward all kinds of trouble. Some people run after it so much that they have given up their faith. Craving more money pushes them away from the faith into error, compounding misery in their lives!
1TI.6.11	Timothy, you are God’s man, so run from all these errors. Instead, chase after true holiness, justice, faithfulness, love, hope, and tender humility. 
1TI.6.12	So fight with faith for the winner’s prize! Lay your hands upon eternal life, for this is your calling—celebrating in faith before the multitude of witnesses!
1TI.6.13	So now, I instruct you before the God of resurrection life and before Jesus, the Anointed One, who demonstrated a beautiful testimony even before Pontius Pilate, 
1TI.6.14	that you follow this commission faithfully with a clear conscience and without blemish until the appearing of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
1TI.6.15	Yes, God will make his appearing in his own divine timing, for he is the exalted God, the only powerful One, the King over every king, and the Lord of power! 
1TI.6.16	He alone is the immortal God, living in the unapproachable light of divine glory! No one has ever seen his fullness, nor can they, for all the glory and endless authority of the universe belongs to him, forever and ever. Amen!
1TI.6.17	To all the rich of this world, I command you not to be wrapped in thoughts of pride over your prosperity, or rely on your wealth, for your riches are unreliable and nothing compared to the living God. Trust instead in the one who lavishes upon us all good things, fulfilling our every need.
1TI.6.18	Remind the wealthy to be rich in remarkable works of extravagant generosity, willing to share with others. 
1TI.6.19	These spiritual investments will provide a beautiful foundation for their lives and secure for them a great future, as they lay their hands upon the meaning of true life.
1TI.6.20	So, my son Timothy, don’t forget all that has been deposited within you. Escape from the empty echoes of men and the perversion of twisted reasoning. 
1TI.6.21	For those who claim to possess this so-called knowledge have already wandered from the true faith.
1TI.6.21	May God’s grace empower you always!
2TI.1.1	From Paul, an apostle of Jesus the Messiah, appointed by God’s pleasure to announce the wonderful promise of life found in Jesus, the anointed Messiah.
2TI.1.2	My beloved son, I pray for a greater release of God’s grace, love, and total well-being to flow into your life from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ!
2TI.1.3	You know that I’ve been called to serve the God of my fathers with a clean conscience. Night and day I pray constantly for you, building a memorial for you with my prayers. 
2TI.1.4	I know that you have wept for me, your spiritual father, and your tears are dear to me. I can’t wait to see you again! I’m filled with joy 
2TI.1.5	as I think of your strong faith 
2TI.1.6	I’m writing to encourage you to fan into a flame and rekindle the fire of the spiritual gift God imparted to you when I laid my hands 
2TI.1.7	For God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who gives you mighty power, love, and self-control. 
2TI.1.8	So never be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor be embarrassed over my imprisonment, but overcome every evil by the revelation of the power of God! 
2TI.1.9	He gave us resurrection life and drew us to himself by his holy calling on our lives. And it wasn’t because of any good we have done, but by his divine pleasure and marvelous grace that confirmed our union with the anointed Jesus, even before time began! 
2TI.1.10	This truth is now being unveiled by the revelation of the anointed Jesus, our life-giver, who has dismantled death, 
2TI.1.11	And he has anointed me as his preacher, his apostle, and his teacher of truth to the nations. 
2TI.1.12	The confidence of my calling enables me to overcome every difficulty without shame, for I have an intimate revelation of this God. And my faith in him convinces me that he is more than able to keep all that I’ve placed in his hands safe and secure until the fullness of his appearing.
2TI.1.13	Allow the healing words you’ve heard from me to live in you and make them a model for life as your faith and love for the Anointed One 
2TI.1.14	Guard well this incomparable treasure by the Spirit of Holiness living within you.
2TI.1.15	Perhaps you’ve heard that Phygelus, and Hermogenes and all the believers of Asia have deserted me because of my imprisonment. 
2TI.1.16	Nevertheless, so many times Onesiphorus was like a breath of fresh air to me and never seemed to be ashamed of my chains. May our Lord Jesus bestow compassion and mercy upon him and his household. 
2TI.1.17	For when he arrived in Rome, he searched and searched for me until he found out 
2TI.1.18	just like he did so wonderfully as I rested in his house while in Ephesus, as you well know.
2TI.1.18	May Jesus, our Master, give him abundant mercy in the day he stands before him.
2TI.2.1	Timothy, my dear son, live your life empowered by God’s free-flowing grace, which is your true strength, found in the anointing of Jesus 
2TI.2.2	And all that you’ve learned from me, confirmed by the integrity of my life, deposit into faithful leaders who are competent to teach the congregations the same revelation.
2TI.2.3	Overcome every form of evil as a victorious soldier of Jesus the Anointed One. 
2TI.2.4	For every soldier called to active duty must divorce himself from the distractions of this world so that he may fully satisfy the one who chose him.
2TI.2.5	An athlete who doesn’t play by the rules will never receive the trophy, 
2TI.2.6	The farmer who labors to produce a crop should be the first one to be fed from its harvest.
2TI.2.7	Carefully consider all that I’ve taught you, and may our Lord inspire you with wisdom and revelation 
2TI.2.8	But make Jesus, the Anointed One, your focus in life and ministry. For he came to earth as the descendant of David and rose from the dead, according to the revelation of the gospel that God has given me. 
2TI.2.9	This is the reason I am persecuted and imprisoned 
2TI.2.10	I endure all these hardships for the benefit of the chosen ones in Christ so that they may also discover the overcoming life that is in Jesus Christ, and experience a glory that lasts forever!
2TI.2.11	You can trust these words:
2TI.2.11	If we were joined with him in his death, then we are joined with him in his life! 
2TI.2.12	If we are joined with him in his sufferings, then we will reign together with him in his triumph. But if we disregard him, then he will also disregard us. 
2TI.2.13	But even if we are faithless, he will still be full of faith, for he never wavers in his faithfulness to us!
2TI.2.14	Be committed to teach the believers all these things 
2TI.2.15	Always be eager to present yourself before God as a perfect and mature minister, without shame, as one who correctly explains the Word of Truth.
2TI.2.16	And avoid empty chatter and worthless words, for they simply add to the irreverence of those who converse in that manner. 
2TI.2.17	For the words of Hymenaeus and Philetus are like gangrene, 
2TI.2.18	They are lost to the truth 
2TI.2.19	But the firm foundation of God has written upon it these two inscriptions: “The Lord God recognizes those who are truly his!” and, “Everyone who worships the name of the Lord Jesus must forsake wickedness!”
2TI.2.20	In a palace you find many kinds of containers and tableware for many different uses. Some are beautifully inlaid with gold or silver, but some are made of wood or earthenware; some of them are used for banquets and special occasions, and some for everyday use. 
2TI.2.21	But you, Timothy, must not see your life and ministry this way. 
2TI.2.22	Run as fast as you can from all the ambitions and lusts of youth; and chase after all that is pure. Whatever builds up your faith and deepens your love must become your holy pursuit. And live in peace with all those who worship our Lord Jesus with pure hearts.
2TI.2.23	Stay away from all the foolish arguments of the immature, for these disputes will only generate more conflict. 
2TI.2.24	For a true servant of our Lord Jesus will not be argumentative but gentle toward all and skilled in helping others see the truth, having great patience toward the immature. 
2TI.2.25	Then with meekness you’ll be able to carefully enlighten those who argue with you so they can see God’s gracious gift of repentance and be brought to the truth. 
2TI.2.26	This will cause them to rediscover themselves and escape from the snare of Satan who caught them in his trap so that they would carry out his purposes.
2TI.3.1	But you need to be aware that in the final days the culture of society will become extremely fierce. 
2TI.3.2	People will be self-centered lovers of themselves and obsessed with money. They will boast of great things as they strut around in their arrogant pride and mock all that is right. They will ignore their own families. They will be ungrateful and ungodly.
2TI.3.3	They will become addicted to hateful and malicious slander. Slaves to their desires, they will be ferocious, belligerent haters of what is good and right. 
2TI.3.4	With brutal treachery, they will act without restraint, bigoted and wrapped in clouds of their conceit. They will find their delight in the pleasures of this world more than the pleasures of the loving God.
2TI.3.5	They may pretend to have a respect for God, but in reality they want nothing to do with God’s power. Stay away from people like these! 
2TI.3.6	For they are the ones who worm their way into the hearts of vulnerable women, spending the night with those who are captured by their lusts and steeped in sin. 
2TI.3.7	They are always learning but never discover the revelation-knowledge of truth.
2TI.3.8	 Jannes and Jambres, who stood against Moses in their arrogance. So it will be in the last days with those who reject the faith with their corrupt minds and arrogant hearts, standing against the truth of God.
2TI.3.9	But they will not advance, for everyone will see their madness, just as they did with 
2TI.3.10	But you, Timothy, have closely followed my example and the truth that I’ve imparted to you. You have modeled your life after the love and endurance 
2TI.3.11	And the same persecutions and difficulties I have endured, 
2TI.3.12	For all who choose to live godly as worshipers of Jesus, the Anointed One, will also experience persecution.
2TI.3.13	But the evil men and sorcerers will progress from bad to worse, deceived and deceiving, as they lead people further from the truth. 
2TI.3.14	Yet you must continue to advance in strength with the truth wrapped around your heart, being assured by God that he’s the One who has truly taught you all these things.
2TI.3.15	Remember what you were taught from your childhood from the Holy Scrolls which can impart to you wisdom to experience everlasting life through the faith of Jesus, the Anointed One! 
2TI.3.16	Every Scripture has been inspired by the Holy Spirit, the breath of God. It will empower you by its instruction and correction, giving you the strength to take the right direction and lead you deeper into the path of godliness. 
2TI.3.17	Then you will be God’s servant, fully mature and perfectly prepared to fulfill any assignment God gives you.
2TI.4.1	Timothy, in the presence of our great God and our Lord Jesus Christ, the One who is destined to judge both the living and the dead by the revelation of his kingdom—I solemnly instruct you to 
2TI.4.2	proclaim the Word of God 
2TI.4.3	For the time is coming when they will no longer listen and respond to the healing words of truth 
2TI.4.4	They will close their ears to the truth and believe nothing but fables and myths. 
2TI.4.5	So be alert to all these things and overcome every form of evil. Carry in your heart the passion of your calling as 
2TI.4.6	And now the time is fast approaching for my release from this life and I am ready to be offered as a sacrifice. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought an excellent fight. I have finished my full course and I’ve kept my heart full of faith. 
2TI.4.8	There’s a crown of righteousness waiting in heaven for me, and I know that my Lord will reward me on his day of righteous judgment. And this crown is not only waiting for me, but for all who love and long for his unveiling.
2TI.4.9	Please come as soon as you can 
2TI.4.10	since Demas deserted me and has left to go to Thessalonica, for he loves his own life. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	That leaves only Luke with me, so find Mark and bring him with you, for he is a tremendous help for me in my ministry.
2TI.4.12	I have also dispatched Tychicus to Ephesus to minister there. 
2TI.4.13	When you come, please bring the leather book bag along with the books I left in Troas with Carpus—especially the parchment scrolls.
2TI.4.14	You need to know that Alexander, the jeweler, has done me great harm. May our Lord give him what he deserves for all he has done. 
2TI.4.15	Be careful of him, for he arrogantly opposes our ministry.
2TI.4.16	At first there was no one I could count on to faithfully stand with me—they all ran off and abandoned me—but don’t hold this against them. 
2TI.4.17	, my Lord himself stood with me, empowering me to complete my ministry of preaching to all the non-Jewish nations so they all could hear the message and be delivered from the mouth of the lion! 
2TI.4.18	And my Lord will continue to deliver me from every form of evil and give me life in his heavenly kingdom. May all the glory go to him alone for all the ages of eternity!
2TI.4.19	Please give my warm regards to Prisca and to Aquila and to Onesiphorus and his family.
2TI.4.20	Erastus has remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I had to leave in Miletus due to his illness.
2TI.4.21	Do your best to come before winter.
2TI.4.21	Eubulus sends his greetings, along with Pudens, Linus, and Claudia, and all those in prison with me.
2TI.4.22	May the anointing of our Lord Jesus be with your spirit and his grace overflow to you!
TIT.1.1	From Paul, God’s willing slave and an apostle of Jesus, the Anointed One, 
TIT.1.2	which rests on the hope of eternal life. God, who never lies, has promised us this before time began. 
TIT.1.3	In his own time he unveiled his word through the preaching 
TIT.1.4	Titus, you are my true son in the faith we share. May grace and peace descend to you from God the Father and our Savior, the Anointed One, Jesus!
TIT.1.5	The reason I stationed you in Crete was so that you could set things in order and complete what was left unfinished, and 
TIT.1.6	Each of them must be above reproach, devoted solely to his wife, whose children are believers and not rebellious or out of control. 
TIT.1.7	The overseer, since he serves God’s household, must be someone of blameless character and not be opinionated or short-tempered. He must not be a drunkard or violent or greedy. 
TIT.1.8	Instead he should be one who is known for his hospitality and a lover of goodness. He should be recognized as one who is fair-minded, pure-hearted, and self-controlled. 
TIT.1.9	He must have a firm grasp of the trustworthy message that he has been taught. This will enable him to both encourage others with healthy teachings and provide convincing answers to those who oppose his message.
TIT.1.10	There are many wayward people, smooth talkers, and deceivers—especially the converts from Judaism. 
TIT.1.11	They must be silenced because they are disrupting entire families with their corrupt teachings, all for their dishonest greed. 
TIT.1.12	A certain one of them, one of their own prophets, said, “Those Cretans are nothing but liars, worthless beasts, and lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	He certainly knew what he was talking about! For this reason, correct them thoroughly so that their lives will line up with the truths of our faith. 
TIT.1.14	Instruct them not to pay any attention to Jewish myths or follow the teachings of those who reject the truth.
TIT.1.15	 all is pure to those who have pure hearts, but to the corrupt unbelievers nothing is pure. Their minds and consciences are defiled. 
TIT.1.16	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are disgusting, disobedient, and disqualified from doing anything good.
TIT.2.1	Your duty is to teach them to embrace a lifestyle that is consistent with sound doctrine. 
TIT.2.2	Lead the male elders into disciplined lives full of dignity and self-control. Urge them to have a solid faith, generous love, and patient endurance.
TIT.2.3	Likewise with the female elders, lead them into lives free from gossip and drunkenness and to be teachers of beautiful things. 
TIT.2.4	This will enable them to teach the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	and to be self-controlled and pure, taking care of their household and being devoted to their husbands. By doing these things the word of God will not be discredited.
TIT.2.6	Likewise, guide the younger men into living disciplined lives 
TIT.2.7	Above all, set yourself apart as a model of a life nobly lived. With dignity, demonstrate integrity in all that you teach. 
TIT.2.8	Bring a clear, wholesome message that cannot be condemned, and then your critics will be embarrassed, with nothing bad to say about us.
TIT.2.9	Servants are to be supportive of their masters and do what is pleasing in every way. They are not to be argumentative 
TIT.2.10	nor steal but prove themselves to be completely loyal and trustworthy. By doing this they will advertise through all that they do the beautiful teachings of God our Savior.
TIT.2.11	God’s marvelous grace has manifested 
TIT.2.12	This same grace teaches us how to live each day as we turn our backs on ungodliness and indulgent lifestyles, and it equips us to live self-controlled, upright, godly lives in this present age. 
TIT.2.13	For we continue to look forward to the joyful fulfillment of our hope in the dawning splendor of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus, the Anointed One. 
TIT.2.14	He sacrificed himself for us that he might purchase our freedom from every lawless deed and to purify for himself a people who are his very own, passionate to do what is beautiful in his eyes.
TIT.2.15	So preach these truths and exhort others to follow them. Be willing to expose sin in order to bring correction with full authority, without being intimidated by anyone.
TIT.3.1	Remind people to respect their governmental leaders on every level as law-abiding citizens and to be ready to fulfill their civic duty. 
TIT.3.2	 to never tear down anyone with their words or quarrel, but instead be considerate, humble, and courteous to everyone. 
TIT.3.3	For it wasn’t that long ago that we behaved foolishly in our stubborn disobedience. We were easily led astray as slaves to worldly passions and pleasures. We wasted our lives in doing evil, and with hateful jealousy we hated others.
TIT.3.4	When the extraordinary compassion of God our Savior
TIT.3.4	and his overpowering love suddenly appeared 
TIT.3.4	,
TIT.3.5	he came to save us.
TIT.3.5	Not because of any virtuous deed that we have done
TIT.3.5	but only because of his extravagant mercy.
TIT.3.6	He saved us,
TIT.3.6	resurrecting us through the washing of rebirth.
TIT.3.6	We are made completely new by the Holy Spirit,
TIT.3.6	whom he splashed over us richly
TIT.3.6	by Jesus, the Messiah, our Life Giver.
TIT.3.7	So as a gift of his love,
TIT.3.7	and since we are faultless—
TIT.3.7	innocent before his face—
TIT.3.7	we can now become heirs 
TIT.3.7	all because of an overflowing hope of eternal life.
TIT.3.8	How true and faithful is this message!
TIT.3.8	I want you to especially emphasize these truths, so that those who believe in God will be careful to devote themselves to doing good works. It is 
TIT.3.9	But avoid useless controversies, genealogies, pointless quarrels, and arguments over the law, which will get you nowhere. 
TIT.3.10	After a first and second warning, have nothing more to do with a divisive person 
TIT.3.11	For you know that such a one is entwined with his sin and stands self-condemned.
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, be sure to meet me at the City of Victory, for I’ve decided to spend the winter there.
TIT.3.13	Give a generous send-off to Zenas the scribe and Apollos, and send them on their journey with what they need.
TIT.3.14	Encourage the believers to be passionately devoted to beautiful works of righteousness by meeting the urgent needs of others and not be unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	Everyone here with me sends their loving greetings to you. Greet the believers who love us in the faith. May God’s wonderful grace be with you all!
TIT.3.15	,
PHM.1.1	From Paul, a prisoner of the Anointed One, Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our precious friend and companion in this work. 
PHM.1.2	To the church that meets in his house, along with our dear sister Apphia and our fellow soldier Archippus.
PHM.1.3	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ pour out his grace and peace upon you.
PHM.1.4	I am always thankful to my God as I remember you in my prayers 
PHM.1.5	because I’m hearing reports about your faith in the Lord Jesus and how much love you have for all his holy followers. 
PHM.1.6	I pray for you that the faith we share may effectively deepen your understanding of every good thing that belongs to you in Christ. 
PHM.1.7	Your love 
PHM.1.8	Even though I have enough boldness in Christ that I could command you to do what is proper, 
PHM.1.9+PHM.1.10	I’d much rather make an appeal because of our friendship. So here I am, an old man, a prisoner for Christ, making my loving appeal to you. It is on behalf of my child, whose spiritual father I became while here in prison; that is, Onesimus. 
PHM.1.11	Formerly he was not useful or valuable to you, but now he is valuable to both of us. 
PHM.1.12	He is my very heart, and I’ve sent him back to you 
PHM.1.13	I would have preferred to keep him at my side so that he could take your place as my helper during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel. 
PHM.1.14	However, I did not want to make this decision without your consent, so that your act of kindness would not be a matter of obligation but out of willingness.
PHM.1.15	Perhaps 
PHM.1.16	So welcome him no longer as a slave, but more than that, as a dearly loved brother. He is that to me especially, and how much more so to you, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me your friend and partner, accept him the same way you would accept me. 
PHM.1.18	And if he has stolen anything from you or owes you anything, just place it on my account.
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, have written these words in my own handwriting. I promise to pay you back everything, to say nothing of the fact that you owe me your very self.
PHM.1.20	Yes, my brother, enrich my soul in the Lord—refresh my heart in Christ! 
PHM.1.21	I’m writing to you with confidence that you will comply with my request and do even more than what I’m asking.
PHM.1.22	And would you do one more thing for me? Since I’m hoping through your prayers to be restored to you soon, please prepare a guest room for me.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in the Anointed One, Jesus, sends his greetings of peace to you, 
PHM.1.24	and so does Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my companions in this ministry.
PHM.1.25	May the unconditional love of the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, be with your spirit!
HEB.1.1	Throughout our history God has spoken to our ancestors by his prophets in many different ways. The revelation he gave them was only a fragment at a time, 
HEB.1.2	But to us living in these last days, God now speaks to us openly in the language of a Son, the appointed Heir of everything, for through him God created the panorama of all things and all time.
HEB.1.3	The Son is the dazzling radiance of God’s splendor, the exact expression of God’s true nature—his mirror image! He holds the universe together and expands it by the mighty power of his spoken word. He accomplished for us the complete cleansing of sins, and then took his seat on the highest throne at the right hand of the majestic One.
HEB.1.4	He is infinitely greater than angels, for he inherited a rank and a Name far greater than theirs. 
HEB.1.5	For God has never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:
HEB.1.5	“You are my favored Son, today I have fathered you.”
HEB.1.5	And this:
HEB.1.5	“I will be the Father to him, and he will be the Son to me.”
HEB.1.6	And again, when he brought his firstborn Son into the world:
HEB.1.6	“Let all my angels bow down before him
HEB.1.6	and kiss him in worship.”
HEB.1.7	And about his angels he says,
HEB.1.7	“I make my angels swift winds,
HEB.1.7	and my ministers fiery flames.”
HEB.1.8	But about his Son, he called him “God,” saying,
HEB.1.8	“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever
HEB.1.8	and you will rule your kingdom
HEB.1.8	with justice and righteousness,
HEB.1.9	For you have cherished righteousness
HEB.1.9	and detested lawlessness.
HEB.1.9	For this reason, God, your God, has anointed you
HEB.1.9	and poured out the oil of bliss on you
HEB.1.9	more than on any of your friends.”
HEB.1.10	And he called him Lord, saying,
HEB.1.10	“Lord, you formed the earth in the beginning
HEB.1.10	and with your own hands you crafted the cosmos.
HEB.1.11	They will both one day disappear,
HEB.1.11	but you will remain forever!
HEB.1.11	They will all fade like a worn-out garment,
HEB.1.12	And they will be changed like clothes,
HEB.1.12	and you will fold them up and put them away.
HEB.1.12	But you are ‘I AM.’
HEB.1.12	You never change, years without end!”
HEB.1.13	And God has never said this to any of his angels:
HEB.1.13	“Take your seat next to me at my right hand
HEB.1.13	until I force your whispering enemies
HEB.1.13	to be a rug under your feet.”
HEB.1.14	What role then, do the angels have? The angels are spirit-messengers sent by God to serve those who are going to be saved.
HEB.2.1	This is why it is so crucial that we be all the more engaged and attentive to the truths that we have heard so that we do not drift off course. 
HEB.2.2	For if the message of the law spoken and confirmed by angels brought a just penalty to every disobedient violation; 
HEB.2.3	then how would we expect to escape 
HEB.2.4	Then God added his witness to theirs. He validated their ministry with signs, astonishing wonders, all kinds of powerful miracles, and by 
HEB.2.5	For God will not place the coming world, of which we speak, under the government of angels. 
HEB.2.6	But the Scriptures affirm:
HEB.2.6	What is man that you would even think about him,
HEB.2.6	or care about Adam’s race.
HEB.2.7	You made him lower than the angels for a little while.
HEB.2.7	You placed your glory and honor
HEB.2.7	upon his head as a crown.
HEB.2.7	And you have given him dominion
HEB.2.7	over the works of your hands,
HEB.2.8	For you have placed everything under his authority.
HEB.2.8	This means that God has left nothing outside the control of his Son, even if presently we have yet to see this accomplished. 
HEB.2.9	But we see Jesus, 
HEB.2.10	For now he towers above all creation, for all things exist through him and for him. And that God made him, pioneer of our salvation, perfect through his sufferings, for this is how he brings many sons and daughters to share in his glory. 
HEB.2.11	Jesus, the Holy One, makes us holy. And as sons and daughters, we now belong to his same Father, so he is not ashamed or embarrassed to introduce us as his brothers and sisters! 
HEB.2.12	For he has said,
HEB.2.12	“I will reveal who you really are to my brothers and sisters,
HEB.2.12	and I will glorify you with praises
HEB.2.12	in the midst of the congregation.”
HEB.2.13	And,
HEB.2.13	“My confidence rests in God!”
HEB.2.13	And again he says,
HEB.2.13	“Here I am, 
HEB.2.14	Since all his “children” have flesh and blood, so Jesus became human to fully identify with us. He did this, so that he could experience death and annihilate the effects of the intimidating accuser who holds against us the power of death. 
HEB.2.15	By embracing death Jesus sets free those who live their entire lives in bondage to the tormenting dread of death. 
HEB.2.16	For it is clear that he didn’t do this for the angels, but for all the sons and daughters of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	This is why he had to be a Man and take hold of our humanity in every way. He made us his brothers and sisters and became our merciful and faithful King-Priest before God; as the One who removed our sins to make us one with him. 
HEB.2.18	He suffered and endured every test and temptation, so that he can help us every time we pass through the ordeals of life.
HEB.3.1	And so, dear brothers and sisters, you are now made holy, and each of you is invited to the feast of your heavenly calling. So fasten your thoughts fully onto Jesus, whom we embrace as our Apostle and King-Priest. 
HEB.3.2	For he was faithful to the Father who appointed him, in the same way that Moses was a model of faithfulness in what was entrusted to him. 
HEB.3.3	But Jesus is worthy to receive a much greater glory than Moses, for the one who builds a house deserves to be honored more than the house he builds. 
HEB.3.4	Every house is built by someone, but God is the Designer and Builder of all things.
HEB.3.5	Indeed, Moses served God faithfully in all he gave him to do. His work prophetically illustrates things that would later be spoken and fulfilled. 
HEB.3.6	But Christ is more than a Servant, he was faithful as the Son in charge of God’s house. And now we are part of his house if we continue courageously to hold firmly to our bold confidence and our victorious hope.
HEB.3.7	This is why the Holy Spirit says,
HEB.3.7	“If only you would listen to his voice this day!
HEB.3.8	Don’t make him angry by hardening your hearts,
HEB.3.8	like your ancestors did during the days of their rebellion,
HEB.3.8	when they were tested in the wilderness.
HEB.3.9	There your fathers tested me and tried my patience
HEB.3.9	even though they saw my miracles for forty years
HEB.3.9	!
HEB.3.10	This ignited my anger with that generation
HEB.3.10	and I said about them, ‘They wander in their hearts
HEB.3.10	just like they do with their feet,
HEB.3.10	and they refuse to learn my ways.’
HEB.3.11	My heart grieved over them so I decreed:
HEB.3.11	‘They will never enter into the calming rest of my Spirit!’ ”
HEB.3.12	So search your hearts every day, my brothers and sisters, and make sure that none of you has evil or unbelief hiding within you. For it will lead you astray, and make you unresponsive to the living God. 
HEB.3.13	This is the time to encourage each other to never be stubborn or hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. 
HEB.3.14	For we are mingled with the Messiah, if we will continue unshaken in this confident assurance from the beginning until the end.
HEB.3.15	For again, the Scriptures say,
HEB.3.15	If only today you would listen to his voice.
HEB.3.15	Don’t make him angry by hardening your hearts,
HEB.3.15	as you did in the wilderness rebellion.
HEB.3.16	The same people who were delivered from bondage and brought out of Egypt by Moses, were the ones who heard and still rebelled. 
HEB.3.17	They grieved God for forty years by sinning in their unbelief, until they dropped dead in the desert. 
HEB.3.18	So God swore an oath that they would never enter into his calming place of rest all because they disobeyed him. 
HEB.3.19	It is clear that they could not enter 
HEB.4.1	Now God has offered to us the same promise of entering into his realm of resting in confident faith. So we must be extremely careful to ensure that we all embrace the fullness of that promise and not fail to experience it. 
HEB.4.2	For we have heard the good news of deliverance just as they did, yet they didn’t join their faith with the Word. Instead, what they heard didn’t affect them deeply, for they doubted. 
HEB.4.3	For those of us who believe, faith activates the promise and we experience the realm of confident rest! For he has said,
HEB.4.3	“I was grieved with them and made a solemn oath,
HEB.4.3	‘They will never enter into the calming rest of my Spirit.’ ”
HEB.4.3	God’s works have all been completed from the foundation of the world, 
HEB.4.4	for it says in the Scriptures,
HEB.4.4	And on the seventh day God rested from all his works.
HEB.4.5	And again, as stated before,
HEB.4.5	They will never enter into my calming place of rest.
HEB.4.6	Those who first heard the good news of deliverance failed to enter into that realm of faith’s rest because of their unbelieving hearts. Yet the fact remains that we still have the opportunity to enter into the faith-rest life and experience the fulfillment of the promise! 
HEB.4.7	For God still has ordained a day for us to enter into called “Today.” For it was long afterwards that God repeated it in David’s words,
HEB.4.7	“If only today you would listen to his voice
HEB.4.7	and do not harden your hearts!”
HEB.4.8	Now if this promise of “rest” was fulfilled when Joshua brought the people into the land, God wouldn’t have spoken later of another “rest” yet to come. 
HEB.4.9	So we conclude that there is still a full and complete “rest” waiting for believers to experience. 
HEB.4.10	As we enter into God’s faith-rest life we cease from our own works, just as God 
HEB.4.11	So then we must give our all and be eager to experience this faith-rest life, so that no one falls short by following the same pattern of doubt and unbelief.
HEB.4.12	For we have the living Word of God, which is full of energy, like a two-mouthed sword. It will even penetrate to the very core of our being where soul and spirit, bone and marrow meet! It interprets and reveals the true thoughts and secret motives of our hearts. 
HEB.4.13	There is not one person who can hide their thoughts from God, for nothing that we do remains a secret, and nothing created is concealed, but everything is exposed and defenseless before his eyes, to whom we must render an account.
HEB.4.14	So then, we must cling in faith to all we know to be true. For we have a magnificent King-Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who rose into the heavenly realm for us, and now sympathizes with us in our frailty. 
HEB.4.15	He understands humanity, for as a Man, our magnificent King-Priest was tempted in every way just as we are, and conquered sin. 
HEB.4.16	So now we come freely and boldly to where love is enthroned, to receive mercy’s kiss and discover the grace we urgently need to strengthen us in our time of weakness.
HEB.5.1	For every High Priest was chosen from among the people and appointed to represent them before God by presenting their gifts to God and offering sacrifices on their behalf. 
HEB.5.2	Since the High Priest is also one who is clothed in weakness, he humbles himself by showing compassion to those who are ignorant of God’s ways and stray from them. 
HEB.5.3	And for this reason, he has to not only present the sin offerings of others, but also to bring a sin offering for himself. 
HEB.5.4	And no one takes this honor upon himself by being self-appointed, but God is the one who calls each one, just as Aaron was called.
HEB.5.5	So also, Christ was not self-appointed and did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but God called and glorified him! For the Father said to him,
HEB.5.5	“You are my favored Son. Today I have fathered you.”
HEB.5.6	And in another Scripture he says about this new priestly order,
HEB.5.6	“You are a Priest like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!”
HEB.5.7	During Christ’s days on earth he pleaded with God, praying with passion and with tearful agony that God would spare him from death. And because of his perfect devotion his prayer was answered and he was delivered. 
HEB.5.8	But even though he was a wonderful Son, he learned to listen and obey through all his sufferings. 
HEB.5.9	And after being proven perfect in this way he has now become the source of eternal salvation to all those who listen to him and obey. 
HEB.5.10	For God has designated him as the King-Priest who is over the priestly order of Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	We have much to say about this topic although it is difficult to explain, because you have become too dull and sluggish to understand. 
HEB.5.12	For you should already be professors instructing others by now; but instead, you need to be taught from the beginning the basics of God’s prophetic oracles! You’re like children still needing milk and not yet ready to digest solid food. 
HEB.5.13	For every spiritual infant who lives on milk is not yet pierced by the revelation of righteousness. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature, whose spiritual senses perceive 
HEB.6.1	Now is the time for us to progress beyond the basic message of Christ and advance into perfection. The foundation has already been laid for us to build upon: turning away from our dead works to embrace faith in God, 
HEB.6.2	teaching about different baptisms, impartation by the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	So with God’s enablement we will move on to deeper truths.
HEB.6.4	It is impossible to restore an apostate. For once a person has come into God’s light, and tasted the gifts of the heavenly realm, and has received the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	and feasted on the good Word of God, and has entered into the power of the age that is breaking in, 
HEB.6.6	if he abandons his faith, there is no use even trying to lead him to repentance. By their sin of apostasy they re-crucify the Son of God, and have publicly repudiated him.
HEB.6.7	 are just like the soil that drinks up the showers which often fall upon it. Some soil will yield crops as God’s blessing upon the field. 
HEB.6.8	But if the field continues to produce only thorns and thistles a curse hangs over it and it will be burned.
HEB.6.9	Having said that, beloved, we are fully convinced that there are more beautiful and excellent things, which flow from your salvation.
HEB.6.10	For God, the Faithful One, is not unfair. How can he forget the 
HEB.6.11	But we long to see you passionately advance until the end and you find your hope fulfilled. 
HEB.6.12	So don’t allow your hearts to grow dull or lose your enthusiasm, but follow the example of those who fully received what God has promised because of their strong faith and patient endurance.
HEB.6.13	Now when God made a promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater than himself, he swore an oath on his own integrity to keep the promise as sure as God exists! 
HEB.6.14	So he said,
HEB.6.14	“Have no doubt, I promise to bless you over and over,
HEB.6.14	 and multiply you without measure!”
HEB.6.15	So Abraham waited patiently in faith and succeeded in seeing the promise fulfilled. 
HEB.6.16	It is very common for people to swear an oath by something greater than themselves, for the oath will confirm their statements and end all dispute. 
HEB.6.17	So in the same way, God wanted to end all doubt and confirm it even more forcefully to those who would inherit his promises. His purpose was unchangeable, so God added his vow to the promise. 
HEB.6.18	So it is impossible for God to lie for we know that his promise and his vow will never change!
HEB.6.18	And now we have run into his heart to hide ourselves in his faithfulness. This is where we find his strength and comfort, for he empowers us to seize what has already been established ahead of time—an unshakeable hope! 
HEB.6.19	We have this certain hope like a strong, unbreakable anchor holding our souls to God himself. Our anchor of hope is fastened 
HEB.6.20	and where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone in before us. He is now and forever our royal Priest like Melchizedek.
HEB.7.1+HEB.7.2	Melchizedek’s name means “king of righteousness.” He was the King of Peace, because the name of the city he ruled as king was Salem, which means “peace.” And he was also a priest of the Most High God. Now when Abraham was returning from defeating many kings in battle, Melchizedek went out to meet him and blessed him. Then Abraham took a tenth of everything he had won in battle and gave it to Melchizedek. 
HEB.7.3	This Melchizedek has no father or mother, and no record of any of his ancestors. He was never born and he never died, but his life is like a picture of the Son of God, a King-Priest forever! 
HEB.7.4	Now let me show you proof of how great this Melchizedek is:
HEB.7.4	– Even though Abraham was the most honored and favored patriarch of all God’s chosen ones, he gave a tithe of the spoils of battle to Melchizedek. 
HEB.7.5	It would be understandable if Melchizedek had been a Jewish priest, for later on God’s people were required by law to support their priests financially, because the priests were their relatives and Abraham’s descendants. 
HEB.7.6	But Melchizedek was not Abraham’s Jewish relative, and yet Abraham still paid him a tithe.
HEB.7.6	– Melchizedek imparted a blessing on mighty Abraham, who had received the promises of God. 
HEB.7.7	And no one could deny the fact that the one who has the power to impart a blessing is superior to the one who receives it.
HEB.7.7	– 
HEB.7.8	Although the Jewish priests received tithes, they all died—they were mortal. But Melchizedek lives on!
HEB.7.8	– 
HEB.7.9	It could even be said that Levi, the ancestor of every Jewish priest who received tithes, actually paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham. 
HEB.7.10	For although Levi was yet unborn, the seed from which Levi came was present in Abraham when he paid his tithe to Melchizedek.
HEB.7.10	– 
HEB.7.11	If any of the Levitical priests who served under the law had the power to bring us into perfection, then why did God send Christ as Priest after the likeness of Melchizedek? He should have said, “After the likeness of Aaron.”
HEB.7.11	– 
HEB.7.12	And furthermore, for God to send a new and different rank of priest, meant a new law would have had to be instituted even to allow it!
HEB.7.13	Yet the One these things all point to, was from a different tribe and no one from that tribe ever officiated at God’s altar, 
HEB.7.14	for we all know that our Lord didn’t descend from the tribe of Levi, but shined from the tribe of Judah. And Moses himself never said anything of a priest in connection with Judah’s tribe.
HEB.7.15	And all this is made even clearer if there was another King-Priest raised up with the rank of Melchizedek. 
HEB.7.16	This King-Priest did not arise because of a genealogical right under the law to be a priest, but by the power of an indestructible, 
HEB.7.17	For it says in the Psalms,
HEB.7.17	You are like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!
HEB.7.18	The old 
HEB.7.19	For the law has never made anyone perfect, but in its place is a far better hope which gives us confidence to experience intimacy with God! 
HEB.7.20	And he confirmed it to us with his solemn vow. For the former priests took their office without an oath, 
HEB.7.21	but with Jesus, God affirmed his royal-priesthood with his promise, saying,
HEB.7.21	The Lord has made a solemn oath
HEB.7.21	and will never change his mind,
HEB.7.21	“You are a King-Priest forever!”
HEB.7.22	So all of this magnifies the truth that we have a superior covenant with God than what they experienced, for Jesus himself is its guarantor! 
HEB.7.23	As additional proof, we know there were many priests under the old system, for they eventually died and their office had to be filled by another. 
HEB.7.24	But Jesus permanently holds his priestly office, since he lives forever and will never have a successor!
HEB.7.25	So he is able to save fully from now throughout eternity, everyone who comes to God through him, because he lives to pray continually for them. 
HEB.7.26	He is the High Priest who perfectly fits our need—holy, without a trace of evil, without the ability to deceive, incapable of sin, and exalted beyond the heavens!
HEB.7.27	Unlike the former high priests, he is not compelled to offer daily sacrifices. They had to bring a sacrifice first for their own sins, then for the sins of the people, but he finished the sacrificial system, once and for all, when he offered himself. 
HEB.7.28	The law appointed flawed men as high priests, but God’s promise, sealed with his oath, which succeeded the law, appoints a perfect Son who is complete forever!
HEB.8.1	Now this is the crowning point of what we are saying: We have a magnificent King-Priest who ministers for us at the right hand of God. He is enthroned with honor next to the throne of the Majesty on high. 
HEB.8.2	He serves in the holy sanctuary in the true heavenly tabernacle set up by God, and not by men. 
HEB.8.3	Since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, so the Messiah also had to bring some sacrifice. 
HEB.8.4	But since he didn’t qualify to be an earthly priest, and there are already priests who offer sacrifices prescribed by the law, 
HEB.8.5	The priests on earth serve in a temple that is but a copy modeled after the heavenly sanctuary; a shadow of the reality. For when Moses began to construct the tabernacle God warned him and said,
HEB.8.5	“You must precisely follow the pattern I revealed to you on Mount Sinai.”
HEB.8.6	But now Jesus the Messiah has accepted a priestly ministry which far surpasses theirs, since he is the catalyst of a better covenant which contains far more wonderful promises! 
HEB.8.7	For if that first covenant had been faultless no one would have needed a second one to replace it. 
HEB.8.8	But God revealed the defect and limitation of the first when he said to his people,
HEB.8.8	“Look! The day will come, declares the Lord,
HEB.8.8	when I will satisfy the people of Israel and Judah
HEB.8.8	by giving them a new covenant.
HEB.8.9	It will be an entirely different covenant
HEB.8.9	than the one I made with their fathers
HEB.8.9	when I led them by my hand out of Egypt.
HEB.8.9	For they did not remain faithful to my covenant,
HEB.8.9	so I rejected them, says the Lord God.
HEB.8.10	For here is the covenant I will one day establish with the people of Israel:
HEB.8.10	I will embed my laws within their thoughts
HEB.8.10	and fasten them onto their hearts.
HEB.8.10	I will be their loyal God and they will be my loyal people.
HEB.8.11	And the result of this will be
HEB.8.11	that everyone will know me as Lord!
HEB.8.11	There will be no need at all to teach their fellow-citizens or brothers by saying,
HEB.8.11	‘You should know the Lord Jehovah,’
HEB.8.11	since everyone will know me 
HEB.8.11	from the most unlikely to the most distinguished.
HEB.8.12	For I will demonstrate my mercy to them
HEB.8.12	and will forgive their evil deeds,
HEB.8.12	and never remember again their sins.”
HEB.8.13	This proves that by establishing this new covenant the first is now obsolete, ready to expire, and about to disappear.
HEB.9.1	Now in the first covenant there were specific rules for worship including a sanctuary on earth to worship in. 
HEB.9.2	When you entered the tabernacle you would first come into the holy chamber where you would find the lampstand and the bread of his presence on the fellowship table. 
HEB.9.3	Then as you pass through the next curtain you would enter the innermost chamber called, the holiest sanctuary of all. 
HEB.9.4	It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of covenant mercy, which was a wooden box covered entirely with gold. And placed inside the ark of covenant mercy was the golden jar with mystery-manna inside, Aaron’s resurrection rod, which had sprouted, and the stone tablets engraved with the covenant laws. 
HEB.9.5	On top of the lid of the ark were two cherubim, angels of splendor, with outstretched wings overshadowing the throne of mercy. But now is not the time to discuss further the significant details of these things.
HEB.9.6	So with this prescribed pattern of worship the priests would routinely go in and out of the first chamber to perform their religious duties. 
HEB.9.7	And the high priest was permitted to enter into the Holiest Sanctuary of All only once a year and he could never enter without first offering sacrificial blood for both his own sins and for the sins of the people.
HEB.9.8	Now the Holy Spirit uses the symbols of this pattern of worship to reveal that the perfect way of holiness had not yet been unveiled. For as long as the tabernacle stood 
HEB.9.9	it was an illustration 
HEB.9.10	For this old pattern of worship was a matter of external rules and rituals concerning food and drink and ceremonial washings which was imposed upon us until the appointed time of heart-restoration had arrived.
HEB.9.11	But now the Anointed One has become the King-Priest of every wonderful thing that has come. For he serves in a greater, more perfect heavenly tabernacle not made by men. 
HEB.9.12	And he has entered once and forever into the Holiest Sanctuary of All, not with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the sacred blood of his own sacrifice. And he alone has made our salvation secure forever!
HEB.9.13	Under the old covenant the blood of bulls, goats, and the ashes of a heifer were sprinkled on those who were defiled and effectively cleansed them outwardly from their ceremonial impurities. 
HEB.9.14	Yet how much more will the sacred blood of the Messiah thoroughly cleanse our consciences! For by the power of the eternal Spirit he has offered himself to God as the perfect Sacrifice that now frees us from our dead works to worship and serve the living God.
HEB.9.15	So Jesus is the One who has enacted a new covenant with a new relationship with God so that those who accept the invitation will receive the eternal inheritance he has promised to his heirs. For he died to release us from the guilt of the violations committed under the first covenant.
HEB.9.16+HEB.9.17	Now a person’s last will and testament can only take effect after one has been proven to have died; otherwise the will cannot be in force while the person who made it is still alive. 
HEB.9.18	So this is why not even the first covenant was inaugurated without the blood of animals. 
HEB.9.19	For Moses ratified the covenant after he gave the people all the commandments of the law. He took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a hyssop branch, and sprinkled both the people and the book of the covenant, 
HEB.9.20	saying,
HEB.9.20	“This is the blood of the covenant that God commands you to keep.”
HEB.9.21	And later Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle with blood and every utensil and item used in their service of worship. 
HEB.9.22	Actually, nearly everything under the law was purified with blood, since forgiveness only comes through an outpouring of blood.
HEB.9.23	And so it was necessary for all the earthly symbols of the heavenly realities to be purified with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves required a superior sacrifice than these. 
HEB.9.24	For the Messiah did not enter into the earthly tabernacle made by men, which was but an echo of the true sanctuary, but he entered into heaven itself to appear before the face of God in our place. 
HEB.9.25	Under the old system year after year the high priest entered the most holy sanctuary with blood that was not his own. But the Messiah did not need to repeatedly offer himself year after year, 
HEB.9.26	for that would mean he must suffer repeatedly ever since the fall of the world. But now he has appeared at the fulfillment of the ages to abolish sin once and for all by the sacrifice of himself!
HEB.9.27	Every human being is appointed to die once, and then to face God’s judgment. 
HEB.9.28	, the One who experienced death once for all to bear the sins of many! And now to those who eagerly await him, he will appear a second time; not to deal with sin, but to bring us the fullness of salvation.
HEB.10.1	The old system of living under the law presented us with only a faint shadow, a crude outline of the reality of the wonderful blessings to come. Even with its steady stream of sacrifices offered year after year, there still was nothing that could make our hearts perfect before God. 
HEB.10.2+HEB.10.3	For if animal sacrifices could once and for all eliminate sin, they would have ceased to be offered and the worshipers would have clean consciences. Instead, once was not enough so by the repetitive sacrifices year after year, the worshipers were continually reminded of their sins, with their hearts still impure. 
HEB.10.4	For what power does the blood of bulls and goats have to remove sin’s guilt?
HEB.10.5	So when Jesus the Messiah came into the world he said,
HEB.10.8	First he said, 
HEB.10.9	And then he said, 
HEB.10.10	By God’s will we have been purified and made holy once and for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus, the Messiah!
HEB.10.11	Yet every day priests still serve, ritually offering the same sacrifices again and again—sacrifices that can never take away sin’s guilt. 
HEB.10.12	But when this Priest had offered the one supreme sacrifice for sin for all time he sat down on a throne at the right hand of God, 
HEB.10.13	waiting until all his whispering enemies are subdued and turn into his footstool. 
HEB.10.14	And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy and complete for all time!
HEB.10.15	The Holy Spirit confirms this to us by this Scripture, for the Lord says,
HEB.10.16	“Afterwards, I will give them this covenant: I will embed my laws into their hearts and fasten my Word to their thoughts.”
HEB.10.17	And then he says,
HEB.10.17	“I will not ever again remember their sins and lawless deeds!”
HEB.10.18	So if our sins have been forgiven and forgotten, why would we ever need to offer another sacrifice for sin?
HEB.10.19	And now we are brothers and sisters in God’s family because of the blood of Jesus, and he welcomes us to come into the most holy sanctuary in the heavenly realm—boldly and without hesitation. 
HEB.10.20	For he has dedicated a new, life-giving way for us to approach God. For just as the veil was torn in two, Jesus’ body was torn open to give us free and fresh access to him!
HEB.10.21	And since we now have a magnificent High Priest to welcome us into God’s house, 
HEB.10.22	we come closer to God and approach him with an open heart, fully convinced that nothing will keep us at a distance from him. For our hearts have been sprinkled with blood to remove impurity, and we have been freed from an accusing conscience. Now we are clean, unstained, and presentable to God inside and out!
HEB.10.23	So now wrap your heart tightly around the hope that lives within us, knowing that God always keeps his promises! 
HEB.10.24	Discover creative ways to encourage others and to motivate them toward acts of compassion, doing beautiful works as expressions of love. 
HEB.10.25	This is not the time to pull away and neglect meeting together, as some have formed the habit of doing. In fact, we should come together even more frequently, eager to encourage and urge each other onward as we anticipate that day dawning.
HEB.10.26	For if we continue to persist in deliberate sin after we have known and received the truth, there is not another sacrifice for sin to be made for us. 
HEB.10.27	But this would qualify one for the certain, terrifying expectation of judgment and the raging fire ready to burn up his enemies! 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who disobeyed Moses’ law died without mercy on the simple evidence of two or three witnesses. 
HEB.10.29	How much more severely do you suppose a person deserves to be judged who has contempt for God’s Son, and who scorns the blood of the new covenant that made him holy, and who mocks the Spirit of grace?
HEB.10.30	For we know him who said,
HEB.10.30	“I have the right to take revenge
HEB.10.30	and pay them back for their evil!”
HEB.10.30	And also,
HEB.10.30	“The Lord God will judge his own people!”
HEB.10.31	It is the most terrifying thing of all to come under the judgment of the Living God!
HEB.10.32	Don’t you remember those days right after the Light shined in your hearts? You endured a great marathon season of suffering hardships, yet you stood your ground. 
HEB.10.33	And at times you were publicly and shamefully mistreated, being persecuted for your faith; then at others times you stood side by side with those who preach the message of hope.
HEB.10.34	You sympathized with those in prison and when all your belongings were confiscated you accepted that violation with joy; convinced that you possess a treasure growing in heaven that could never be taken from you. 
HEB.10.35	So don’t lose your bold, courageous faith, for you are destined for a great reward!
HEB.10.36	You need the strength of endurance to reveal the poetry of God’s will and then you receive the promise in full. 
HEB.10.37	For soon and very soon,
HEB.10.37	“The One who is appearing will come without delay!”
HEB.10.38	And he also says,
HEB.10.38	“My righteous ones will live from my faith.
HEB.10.38	But if fear holds them back,
HEB.10.38	my soul is not content with them!”
HEB.10.39	But we are certainly not those who are held back by fear and perish; we are among those who have faith and experience true life!
HEB.11.1	Now faith brings our hopes into reality and becomes the foundation needed to acquire the things we long for. It is all the evidence required to prove what is still unseen. 
HEB.11.2	This testimony of faith is what previous generations were commended for. 
HEB.11.3	Faith empowers us to see that the universe was created and beautifully coordinated by the power of God’s words! He spoke and the invisible realm gave birth to all that is seen.
HEB.11.4	Faith moved Abel to choose a more acceptable sacrifice to offer God than his brother Cain, and God declared him righteous because of his offering of faith. By his faith, Abel still speaks instruction to us today, even though he is long dead.
HEB.11.5	Faith translated Enoch from this life and he was taken up into heaven! He never had to experience death; he just disappeared from this world because God promoted him. For before he was translated to the heavenly realm his life had become a pleasure to God.
HEB.11.6	And without faith living within us it would be impossible to please God. For we come to God in faith knowing that he is real and that he rewards the faith of those who passionately seek him.
HEB.11.7	Faith opened Noah’s heart to receive revelation and warnings from God about what was coming, even things that had never been seen. But he stepped out in reverent obedience to God and built an ark that would save him and his family. By his faith the world was condemned, but Noah received God’s gift of righteousness that comes by believing.
HEB.11.8	Faith motivated Abraham to obey God’s call and leave the familiar to discover the territory he was destined to inherit from God. So he left with only a promise and without even knowing ahead of time where he was going, Abraham stepped out in faith. 
HEB.11.9	He lived by faith as an immigrant in his promised land as though it belonged to someone else. He journeyed through the land living in tents with Isaac and Jacob who were persuaded that they were also co-heirs of the same promise.
HEB.11.10	His eyes of faith were set on the city with unshakable foundations, whose architect and builder is God himself. 
HEB.11.11	Sarah’s faith embraced 
HEB.11.12	In fact, so many children were subsequently fathered by this aged man of faith—one who was as good as dead, that he now has offspring as innumerable as the sand on the seashore and as the stars in the sky!
HEB.11.13	These heroes all died still clinging to their faith, not even receiving all that had been promised them. But they saw beyond the horizon the fulfillment of their promises and gladly embraced it from afar. They all lived their lives on earth as those who belonged to another realm.
HEB.11.14	For clearly, those who live this way are longing for the appearing of a heavenly city. 
HEB.11.15	And if their hearts were still remembering what they left behind, they would have found an opportunity to go back. 
HEB.11.16	But they couldn’t turn back for their hearts were fixed on what was far greater, that is, the heavenly realm!
HEB.11.16	So because of this God is not ashamed in any way to be called their God, for he has prepared a heavenly city for them.
HEB.11.17	Faith operated powerfully in Abraham for when he was put to the test he offered up Isaac. Even though he received God’s promises of descendants, he was willing to offer up his only son! 
HEB.11.18	For God had promised,
HEB.11.18	“Through your son Isaac your lineage will carry on your name.”
HEB.11.19	Abraham’s faith made it logical to him that God could raise Isaac from the dead, and symbolically, that’s exactly what happened.
HEB.11.20	The power of faith prompted Isaac to impart a blessing to his sons, Jacob and Esau, concerning their prophetic destinies.
HEB.11.21	Jacob worshiped in faith’s reality at the end of his life, and leaning upon his staff he imparted a prophetic blessing upon each of Joseph’s sons.
HEB.11.22	Faith inspired Joseph and opened his eyes to see into the future, for as he was dying he prophesied about the exodus of Israel out of Egypt, and gave instructions that his bones were to be taken from Egypt with them.
HEB.11.23	Faith prompted the parents of Moses at his birth to hide him for three months, because they realized their child was exceptional and 
HEB.11.24	Faith enabled Moses to choose God’s will, for although he was raised as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, he refused to make that his identity, 
HEB.11.25	choosing instead to suffer mistreatment with the people of God. Moses preferred faith’s certainty above the momentary enjoyment of sin’s pleasures. 
HEB.11.26	He found his true wealth in suffering abuse for being anointed, more than in anything the world could offer him, for his eyes looked with wonder not on the immediate, but on the ultimate—faith’s great reward! 
HEB.11.27	Holding faith’s promise Moses abandoned Egypt and had no fear of Pharaoh’s rage because he persisted in faith as if he had seen God who is unseen.
HEB.11.28	Faith stirred Moses to perform the rite of Passover and sprinkle lamb’s blood, to prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn.
HEB.11.29	Faith opened the way for the Hebrews to cross the Red Sea as if on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to cross they were swallowed up and drowned!
HEB.11.30	Faith pulled down Jericho’s walls after the people marched around them for seven days!
HEB.11.31	Faith provided a way of escape for Rahab the prostitute, avoiding the destruction of the unbelievers, because she received the Hebrew spies in peace.
HEB.11.32	And what more could I say to convince you? For there is not enough time to tell you of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. 
HEB.11.33	Through faith’s power they conquered kingdoms and established true justice. Their faith fastened onto their promises and pulled them into reality! It was faith that shut the mouth of lions, 
HEB.11.34	put out the power of raging fire, and caused many to escape certain death by the sword. Although weak, their faith imparted power to make them strong! Faith sparked courage within them and they became mighty warriors in battle, pulling armies from another realm into battle array. 
HEB.11.35	Faith-filled women saw their dead children raised in resurrection power.
HEB.11.35	Yet it was faith that enabled others to endure great atrocities. They were stretched out on the wheel and tortured, and didn’t deny their faith in order to be freed, because they longed for a more honorable and glorious resurrection!
HEB.11.36	Others were mocked and experienced the most severe beating with whips; they were in chains and imprisoned. 
HEB.11.37	Some of these faith champions were brutally killed by stoning, being sawn in two or slaughtered by the sword. These lived in faith as they went about wearing goatskins and sheepskins for clothing. They lost everything they possessed, they endured great afflictions, and they were cruelly mistreated. 
HEB.11.38	They wandered the earth living in the desert wilderness, in caves, on barren mountains and in holes in the earth. Truly, the world was not even worthy of them, not realizing who they were.
HEB.11.39	These were the true heroes, commended for their faith, yet they lived in hope without receiving the fullness of what was promised them. 
HEB.11.40	But now God has invited us to live in something better than what they had—faith’s fullness! This is so that they could be brought to finished perfection alongside of us.
HEB.12.1	As for us, we have all of these great witnesses who encircle us like clouds. So we must let go of every wound that has pierced us and the sin we so easily fall into. Then we will be able to run life’s marathon race with passion and determination, for the path has been already marked out before us.
HEB.12.2	We look away from the natural realm and we fasten our gaze onto Jesus who birthed faith within us and who leads us forward into faith’s perfection. His example is this: Because his heart was focused on the joy of knowing that you would be his, he endured the agony of the cross and conquered its humiliation, and now sits exalted at the right hand of the throne of God!
HEB.12.3	So consider carefully how Jesus faced such intense opposition from sinners who opposed their own souls, so that you won’t become worn down and cave in under life’s pressures. 
HEB.12.4	After all, you have not yet reached the point of sweating blood in your opposition to sin. 
HEB.12.5	And have you forgotten his encouraging words spoken to you as his children? He said,
HEB.12.5	“My child, don’t underestimate the value
HEB.12.5	of the discipline and training of the Lord God,
HEB.12.5	or get depressed when he has to correct you.
HEB.12.6	For the Lord’s training of your life
HEB.12.6	is the evidence of his faithful love.
HEB.12.6	And when he draws you to himself,
HEB.12.6	it proves you are his delightful child.”
HEB.12.7	Fully embrace God’s correction as part of your training, for he is doing what any loving father does for his children. For who has ever heard of a child who never had to be corrected? 
HEB.12.8	We all should welcome God’s discipline as the validation of authentic sonship. For if we have never once endured his correction it only proves we are strangers and not sons.
HEB.12.9	And isn’t it true that we respect our earthly fathers even though they corrected and disciplined us? Then we should demonstrate an even greater respect for God, our spiritual Father, as we submit to his life-giving discipline. 
HEB.12.10	Our parents corrected us for the short time of our childhood as it seemed good to them. But God corrects us throughout our lives for our own good, giving us an invitation to share his holiness. 
HEB.12.11	Now all discipline seems to be more pain than pleasure at the time, yet later it will produce a transformation of character, bringing a harvest of righteousness and peace to those who yield to it.
HEB.12.12	So be made strong even in your weakness by lifting up your tired hands 
HEB.12.13	for as you keep walking forward on God’s paths all your stumbling ways will be divinely healed!
HEB.12.14	In every relationship be swift to choose peace over competition, and run swiftly toward holiness, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	Watch over each other to make sure that no one misses the revelation of God’s grace. And make sure no one lives with a root of bitterness sprouting within them which will only cause trouble and poison the hearts of many.
HEB.12.16	Be careful that no one among you lives in immorality, becoming careless about God’s blessings, like Esau who traded away his rights as the firstborn for a simple meal. 
HEB.12.17	And we know that later on when he wanted to inherit his father’s blessing, he was turned away, even though he begged for it with bitter tears, for it was too late then to repent.
HEB.12.18	For we are not coming, 
HEB.12.19	We are not those who are being warned by the jarring blast of a trumpet and the thundering voice; the fearful voice that they begged to be silenced. 
HEB.12.20	They couldn’t handle God’s command that said,
HEB.12.20	“If so much as an animal approaches the mountain it is to be stoned to death!”
HEB.12.21	The astounding phenomena Moses witnessed caused him to shudder with fear and he could only say, “I am trembling in terror!”
HEB.12.22	By contrast, we have already come near to God in a totally different realm, the Zion-realm, for we have entered the city of the Living God, which is the New Jerusalem in heaven! We have joined the festal gathering of myriads of angels in their joyous celebration!
HEB.12.23	And as members of the church of the Firstborn all our names have been legally registered as citizens of heaven! And we have come before God who judges all, and who lives among the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect in his eyes!
HEB.12.24	And we have come to Jesus who established a new covenant with his blood sprinkled upon the mercy seat; blood that continues to speak from heaven, “forgiveness,” a better message than Abel’s blood that cries from the earth, “justice.”
HEB.12.25	Make very sure that you never refuse to listen to God when he speaks! For the God who spoke on earth from Sinai is the same God who now speaks from heaven. Those who heard him speak his living Word on earth found nowhere to hide, so what chance is there for us to escape if we turn our backs on God and refuse to hear his warnings as he speaks from heaven?
HEB.12.26	The earth was rocked at the sound of his voice from the mountain, but now he has promised,
HEB.12.26	“Once and for all I will not only shake the systems of the world,
HEB.12.26	but also the unseen powers in the heavenly realm!”
HEB.12.27	Now this phrase “once and for all” clearly indicates the final removal of things that are shaking, that is, the old order, so only what is unshakeable will remain. 
HEB.12.28	Since we are receiving our rights to an unshakeable kingdom we should be extremely thankful and offer God the purest worship that delights his heart as we lay down our lives in absolute surrender, filled with awe. 
HEB.12.29	For our God is a holy, devouring fire!
HEB.13.1	No matter what, make room in your heart to love every believer. 
HEB.13.2	And show hospitality to strangers, for they may be angels from God showing up as your guests. 
HEB.13.3	Identify with those who are in prison as though you were there suffering with them, and those who are mistreated as if you could feel their pain.
HEB.13.4	Honor the sanctity of marriage and keep your vows of purity to one another, for God will judge sexual immorality in any form, whether single or married.
HEB.13.5	Don’t be obsessed with money but live content with what you have, for you always have God’s presence. For hasn’t he promised you,
HEB.13.5	“I will never leave you alone, never! And I will not loosen my grip on your life!”
HEB.13.6	So we can say with great confidence:
HEB.13.6	“I know the Lord is for me
HEB.13.6	and I will never be afraid of what people may do to me!”
HEB.13.7	Don’t forget the example of your spiritual leaders who have spoken God’s messages to you, take a close look at how their lives ended, and then follow their walk of faith.
HEB.13.8	Jesus, the Anointed One, is always the same—yesterday, today, and forever. 
HEB.13.9	So don’t let anyone lead you astray with all sorts of novel and exotic teachings. It is more beautiful to feast on grace and be inwardly strengthened than to be obsessed with dietary rules which in themselves have no lasting benefit.
HEB.13.10	We feast on a sacrifice at our spiritual altar, but those who serve as priests in the old system of worship have no right to eat of it. 
HEB.13.11	For the high priest carries the blood of animals into the holiest chamber as a sacrifice for sin, and then burns the bodies of the animals outside the city. 
HEB.13.12	And Jesus, our sin-sacrifice, also suffered death outside the city walls to make us holy by his own blood.
HEB.13.13	So we must arise and join him outside the religious “walls” and bear his disgrace. 
HEB.13.14	For we have no city here on earth to be our permanent home, but we seek the city that is destined to come. 
HEB.13.15	So we no longer offer up a steady stream of blood sacrifices, but through Jesus, we will offer up to God a steady stream of praise sacrifices—these are “the lambs” we offer from our lips that celebrate his name!
HEB.13.16	We will show mercy to the poor and not miss an opportunity to do acts of kindness for others, for these are the true sacrifices that delight God’s heart.
HEB.13.17	Obey your spiritual leaders and recognize their authority, for they keep watch over your soul without resting since they will have to give an account to God for their work. So it will benefit you when you make their work a pleasure and not a heavy burden.
HEB.13.18	And keep praying for us that we continue to live with a clear conscience, for we desire to live honorably in all that we do. 
HEB.13.19	And I especially ask you to pray that God would send me back to you very soon.
HEB.13.20	Now may the God who brought us peace by raising from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ so that he would be the Great Shepherd of his flock; and by the power of the blood of the eternal covenant 
HEB.13.21	may he work perfection into every part of you giving you all that you need to fulfill your destiny. And may he express through you all that is excellent and pleasing to him through your life-union with Jesus the Anointed One who is to receive all glory forever! Amen!
HEB.13.22	My dear brothers and sisters, I urge you to let your spirits flow through this message of love that I’ve written to you in these few words. 
HEB.13.23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy is free again and as soon as he arrives here we’ll come together to see you. We extend our greetings to all your leaders and all the holy believers. 
HEB.13.24	The Italian believers also send their greetings. 
HEB.13.25	Now may God’s wonderful grace be poured out upon you all! Amen!
JAS.1.1	Greetings! My name is Jacob, and I’m a love-slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I’m writing to all the twelve tribes of Israel who have been sown as seeds among the nations.
JAS.1.2	My fellow believers, when it seems as though you are facing nothing but difficulties, see it as an invaluable opportunity to experience the greatest joy that you can! 
JAS.1.3	For you know that when your faith is tested it stirs up power within you to endure all things. 
JAS.1.4	And then as your endurance grows even stronger it will release perfection into every part of your being until there is nothing missing and nothing lacking.
JAS.1.5	And if anyone longs to be wise, ask God for wisdom and he will give it! He won’t see your lack of wisdom as an opportunity to scold you over your failures but he will overwhelm your failures with his generous grace. 
JAS.1.6	Just make sure you ask empowered by confident faith without doubting that you will receive. For the ambivalent person believes one minute and doubts the next. Being undecided makes you become like the rough seas driven and tossed by the wind. You’re up one minute and tossed down the next. 
JAS.1.7+JAS.1.8	When you are half-hearted and wavering it leaves you unstable. Can you really expect to receive anything from the Lord when you’re in that condition?
JAS.1.9	The believer who is poor still has reasons to boast, for he has been placed on high. 
JAS.1.10	But those who are rich should boast in how God has brought them low and humbled them, for all their earthly glory will one day fade away like a wildflower in the meadow. 
JAS.1.11	For as the scorching heat of the sun causes the petals of the wildflower to fall off and lose its appearance of beauty, so the rich in the midst of their pursuit of wealth will wither away.
JAS.1.12	If your faith remains strong, even while surrounded by life’s difficulties, you will continue to experience the untold blessings of God! True happiness comes as you pass the test with faith, and receive the victorious crown of life promised to every lover of God!
JAS.1.13	When you are tempted don’t ever say, “God is tempting me,” for God is incapable of being tempted by evil and he is never the source of temptation. 
JAS.1.14	Instead it is each person’s own desires and thoughts that drag them into evil and lure them away into darkness. 
JAS.1.15	Evil desires give birth to evil actions. And when sin is fully mature it can murder you! 
JAS.1.16	So my friends, don’t be fooled by your own desires!
JAS.1.17	Every gift God freely gives us is good and perfect, streaming down from the Father of lights, who shines from the heavens with no hidden shadow or darkness and is never subject to change. 
JAS.1.18	God was delighted to give us birth by the truth of his infallible Word so that we would fulfill his chosen destiny for us and become the favorite ones out of all his creation!
JAS.1.19	My dearest brothers and sisters, take this to heart: Be quick to listen, but slow to speak. And be slow to become angry, 
JAS.1.20	for human anger is never a legitimate tool to promote God’s righteous purpose. 
JAS.1.21	So this is why we abandon everything morally impure and all forms of wicked conduct. Instead, with a sensitive spirit we absorb God’s Word, which has been implanted within our nature, for the Word of Life has power to continually deliver us.
JAS.1.22	Don’t just listen to the Word of Truth and not respond to it, for that is the essence of self-deception. So always let his Word become like poetry written and fulfilled by your life!
JAS.1.23	If you listen to the Word and don’t live out the message you hear, you become like the person who looks in the mirror of the Word to discover the reflection of his face in the beginning. 
JAS.1.24	, but then you go out and forget your divine origin. 
JAS.1.25	But those who set their gaze deeply into the perfecting law of liberty are fascinated by and respond to the truth they hear and are strengthened by it—they experience God’s blessing in all that they do!
JAS.1.26	If someone believes they have a relationship with God but fails to guard his words then his heart is drifting away and his religion is shallow and empty.
JAS.1.27	True spirituality that is pure in the eyes of our Father God is to make a difference in the lives of the orphans, and widows in their troubles, and to refuse to be corrupted by the world’s values.
JAS.2.1	My dear brothers and sisters, fellow believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ—how could we say that we have faith in him and yet we favor one group of people above another? 
JAS.2.2	Suppose an influential man comes into your worship meeting wearing gold rings and expensive clothing, and also a homeless man in shabby clothes comes in. 
JAS.2.3	If you show special attention to the rich man in expensive clothes and say, “Here’s a seat of honor for you right up front!” but you turn and say to the poor beggar dressed in rags, “You can stand over here,” or “Sit over there on the floor in the back,” 
JAS.2.4	then you’ve demonstrated gross prejudice among yourselves and used evil standards of judgment!
JAS.2.5	So listen carefully, my dear brothers and sisters, hasn’t God chosen the poor in the world’s eyes to be those who are rich in faith? And won’t they be the heirs of the kingdom-realm he promised to those who love him? 
JAS.2.6	But yet you insult and shun the poor 
JAS.2.7	Aren’t they the very ones who blaspheme the beautiful name of the One you now belong to?
JAS.2.8	Your calling is to fulfill the royal law of love as given to us in this Scripture: “You must love and value your neighbor as you love and value yourself!”
JAS.2.8	For keeping this law is the noble way to live. 
JAS.2.9	But when you show prejudice you commit sin and you violate this royal law of love!
JAS.2.10	For the one who attempts to keep all of the law of Moses but fails in just one point has become guilty of breaking the law in every respect! 
JAS.2.11	For the same One who tells us, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you don’t commit adultery but do commit murder, you are still guilty as a law-breaker. 
JAS.2.12	So we must both speak and act in every respect like those who are destined to be tried by the perfect law of liberty, 
JAS.2.13	and remember that judgment is merciless for the one who judges others without mercy. So by showing mercy you take dominion over judgment!
JAS.2.14	My dear brothers and sisters, what good is it if someone claims to have faith but demonstrates no good works to prove it? How could this kind of faith save anyone? 
JAS.2.15	For example, if a brother or sister in the faith is poorly clothed and hungry 
JAS.2.16	and you leave them saying, “Good-bye. I hope you stay warm and have plenty to eat,” but you don’t provide them with a coat or even a cup of soup, what good is your faith? 
JAS.2.17	So then faith that doesn’t involve action is phony.
JAS.2.18	But someone might object and say, “One person has faith and another person has works.” Go ahead then and prove to me that you have faith without works and I will show you faith by my works as proof that I believe. 
JAS.2.19	You can believe all you want that there is one true God, that’s wonderful! But even the demons know this and tremble with fear before him, yet they’re unchanged—
JAS.2.20	O feeble sons of Adam, do you need further evidence that faith divorced from good works is phony? 
JAS.2.21	Wasn’t our ancestor Abraham found righteous before God because of his works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	Can’t you see how his action cooperated with his faith and by his action faith found its full expression? 
JAS.2.23	So in this way the Scripture was fulfilled:
JAS.2.23	Because Abraham believed God, his faith was exchanged for God’s righteousness.
JAS.2.23	So he became known as the lover of God! 
JAS.2.24	So now it’s clear that a person is seen as righteous in God’s eyes not merely by faith alone, but by his works.
JAS.2.25	And the same is true of the prostitute named Rahab who was found righteous in God’s eyes by her works, for she received the spies into her home and helped them escape from the city by another route. 
JAS.2.26	For just as a human body without the spirit is a dead corpse, so faith without the expression of good works is dead!
JAS.3.1	My dear brothers and sisters, don’t be so eager to become a teacher in the church since you know that we who teach are held to a higher standard of judgment. 
JAS.3.2	We all fail in many areas, but especially with our words. Yet if we’re able to bridle the words we say we are powerful enough to control ourselves in every way, and that means our character is mature and fully developed. 
JAS.3.3	Horses have bits and bridles in their mouths so that we can control and guide their large body. 
JAS.3.4	And the same with mighty ships, though they are massive and driven by fierce winds, yet they are steered by a tiny rudder at the direction of the person at the helm.
JAS.3.5	And so the tongue is a small part of the body yet it carries great power! Just think of how a small flame can set a huge forest ablaze. 
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire! It can be compared to the sum total of wickedness and is the most dangerous part of our human body. It corrupts the entire body and is a hellish flame! It releases a fire that can burn throughout the course of human existence.
JAS.3.7	For every wild animal on earth including birds, creeping reptiles, and creatures of the sea and land have all been overpowered and tamed by humans, 
JAS.3.8	but the tongue is not able to be tamed. It’s a fickle, unrestrained evil that spews out words full of toxic poison! 
JAS.3.9	We use our tongue to praise God our Father and then turn around and curse a person who was made in his very image! 
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth we pour out words of praise one minute and curses the next. My brothers and sister, this should never be!
JAS.3.11+JAS.3.12	Would you look for olives hanging on a fig tree or go to pick figs from a grapevine? Is it possible that fresh and bitter water can flow out of the same spring? So neither can a bitter spring produce fresh water.
JAS.3.13	If you consider yourself to be wise and one who understands the ways of God, advertise it with a beautiful, fruitful life guided by wisdom’s gentleness. Never brag or boast about what you’ve done and you’ll prove that you’re truly wise. 
JAS.3.14	But if there is bitter jealousy or competition hiding in your heart, then don’t deny it and try to compensate for it by boasting and being phony. 
JAS.3.15	For that has nothing to do with God’s heavenly wisdom but can best be described as the wisdom of this world, both selfish and devilish. 
JAS.3.16	So wherever jealousy and selfishness are uncovered, you will also find many troubles and every kind of meanness.
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is always pure, filled with peace, considerate and teachable. It is filled with love and never displays prejudice or hypocrisy in any form 
JAS.3.18	and it always bears the beautiful harvest of righteousness! Good seeds of wisdom’s fruit will be planted with peaceful acts by those who cherish making peace.
JAS.4.1	What is the cause of your conflicts and quarrels with each other? Doesn’t the battle begin inside of you as you fight to have your own way and fulfill your own desires? 
JAS.4.2	You jealously want what others have so you begin to see yourself as better than others. You scheme with envy and harm others to selfishly obtain what you crave—that’s why you quarrel and fight. And all the time you don’t obtain what you want because you won’t ask God for it! 
JAS.4.3	And if you ask, you won’t receive it for you’re asking with corrupt motives, seeking only to fulfill your own selfish desires. 
JAS.4.4	You have become spiritual adulterers who are having an affair, an unholy relationship with the world. Don’t you know that flirting with the world’s values places you at odds with God? Whoever chooses to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy!
JAS.4.5	Does the Scripture mean nothing to you that says, “The Spirit that God breathed into our hearts is a jealous Lover who intensely desires to have more and more of us”?
JAS.4.6	But he continues to pour out more and more grace upon us. For it says,
JAS.4.6	God resists you when you are proud
JAS.4.6	but continually pours out grace when you are humble.”
JAS.4.7	So then, surrender to God. Stand up to the devil and resist him and he will turn and run away from you. 
JAS.4.8	Move your heart closer and closer to God, and he will come even closer to you. But make sure you cleanse your life, you sinners, and keep your heart pure and stop doubting. 
JAS.4.9	Feel the pain of your sin, be sorrowful and weep! Let your joking around be turned into mourning and your joy into deep humiliation. 
JAS.4.10	Be willing to be made low before the Lord and he will exalt you!
JAS.4.11	Dear friends, as part of God’s family, never speak against another family member, for when you slander a brother or sister you violate God’s law 
JAS.4.12	There is only one true Lawgiver and Judge, the One who has the power to save and destroy—so who do you think you are to judge your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	Listen, those of you who are boasting, “Today or tomorrow we’ll go to another city and spend some time and go into business and make heaps of profit!” 
JAS.4.14	But you don’t have a clue what tomorrow may bring. For your fleeting life is but a warm breath of air that is visible in the cold only for a moment and then vanishes! 
JAS.4.15	Instead you should say, “Our tomorrows are in the Lord’s hands and if he is willing we will live life to its fullest and do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	But here you are, boasting in your ignorance, for to be presumptuous about what you’ll do tomorrow is evil!
JAS.4.17	So if you know of an opportunity to do the right thing today, yet you refrain from doing it, you’re guilty of sin.
JAS.5.1	Listen all you who are rich, for it’s time to weep and howl over the misery that will overtake you! 
JAS.5.2	Your riches lie rotting, your fine clothing eaten by moths, 
JAS.5.3	and your gold and silver are corroded as a witness against you. You have hoarded up treasure for the last days but it will become a fire to burn your flesh. 
JAS.5.4	Listen! Can’t you hear the cries of the laborers over the wages you fraudulently held back from those who worked for you? The cries for justice of those you’ve cheated have reached the ears of the Lord of armies!
JAS.5.5	You have indulged yourselves with every luxury and pleasure this world offers, but you’re only stuffing your heart full for a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned and murdered good and innocent people who had no power to defend themselves.
JAS.5.7	Meanwhile, brothers and sisters, we must be patient and filled with expectation as we wait for the appearing of the Lord. Think about the farmer who has to patiently wait for the earth’s harvest as it ripens because of the early and latter rains. 
JAS.5.8	So you also, keep your hopes high and be patient, for the presence of the Lord is drawing closer. 
JAS.5.9	Since each of you are part of God’s family never complain or grumble about each other so that judgment will not come on you, for the true Judge is near and very ready to appear!
JAS.5.10	My brothers and sisters, take the prophets as your mentors. They have prophesied in the name of the Lord and 
JAS.5.11	We honor them as our heroes because they remained faithful even while enduring great sufferings. And you have heard of all that Job went through and we can now see that the Lord ultimately treated him with wonderful kindness, revealing how tenderhearted he really is!
JAS.5.12	Above all we must be those who never need to verify our speech as truthful by swearing by the heavens or the earth or any other oath. But instead we must be so full of integrity that our “Yes” or “No” is convincing enough and we do not stumble into hypocrisy.
JAS.5.13	Are there any believers in your fellowship suffering great hardship and distress? Encourage them to pray! Are there happy, cheerful ones among you? Encourage them to sing out their praises! 
JAS.5.14	Are there any sick among you? Then ask the elders of the church to come and pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of our Lord. 
JAS.5.15	And the prayer of faith will heal the sick and the Lord will raise them up, and if they have committed sins they will be forgiven.
JAS.5.16	Confess and acknowledge how you have offended one another and then pray for one another to be instantly healed, for tremendous power is released through the passionate, heartfelt prayer of a godly believer!
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man with human frailties, just like all of us, but he prayed and received supernatural answers. He actually shut the heavens over the land so there would be no rain for three and a half years! 
JAS.5.18	Then he prayed again and the skies opened up over the land so that the rain came again and produced the harvest.
JAS.5.19	Finally, as members of God’s beloved family, we must go after the one who wanders from the truth and bring him back. 
JAS.5.20	For the one who restores the sinning believer back to God from the error of his way, gives back to his soul life from the dead, and covers over countless sins 
1PE.1.1	From Peter, an apostle of Jesus the Anointed One, to the chosen ones who have been scattered abroad like “seed” into the nations living as refugees, to those living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and throughout 
1PE.1.2	, for you have been chosen and destined by Father God. The Holy Spirit has set you apart to be God’s holy ones, obedient followers of Jesus Christ who have been 
1PE.1.3	Celebrate with praises the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has shown us his extravagant mercy. For his 
1PE.1.4	We are reborn into a perfect inheritance that can never perish, never be defiled, and never diminish. It is promised and preserved forever in the heavenly realm for you!
1PE.1.5	Through our faith, the mighty power of God constantly guards us until our 
1PE.1.6	May the thought of this cause you to jump for joy, even though lately you’ve had to put up with the grief of many trials. 
1PE.1.7	But these only reveal the sterling core of your faith, which is far more valuable than gold that perishes, for even gold is refined by fire. 
1PE.1.8	You love him passionately although you did not see him, but through believing in him you are saturated with an ecstatic joy, indescribably sublime and immersed in glory. 
1PE.1.9	For you are reaping the harvest of your faith—the full salvation promised you—your souls’ victory!
1PE.1.10	This salvation was the focus of the prophets who prophesied of this 
1PE.1.11	as they probed into 
1PE.1.12	God revealed to the prophets that their ministry was not for their own benefit but for yours. And now, you have heard these things from the evangelists who preached the gospel to you through 
1PE.1.13	So then, prepare your 
1PE.1.14	As God’s obedient children, never again shape your lives by the desires that you followed when you didn’t know better. 
1PE.1.15	Instead, shape your lives to become like the Holy One who called you. 
1PE.1.16	For Scripture says:
1PE.1.16	“You are to be holy, because I am holy.”
1PE.1.17	Since you call on him as your heavenly Father, the impartial Judge who judges according to each one’s works, live each day with holy awe and reverence throughout your time on earth. 
1PE.1.18	For you know that your lives were ransomed once and for all from the empty and futile way of life handed down from generation to generation. It was not a ransom payment of silver and gold, which eventually perishes, 
1PE.1.19	but the precious blood of Christ—who like a spotless, unblemished lamb was 
1PE.1.20	, for he was chosen and destined for this before the foundation of the earth was laid, but he has been made manifest in these last days for you. 
1PE.1.21	It is through him that you now believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, so that you would fasten your faith and hope in God 
1PE.1.22	Now, because of your obedience to the truth, you have purified your very souls, and this empowers you to be full of love for your fellow believers. So express this sincere love toward one another passionately and with a pure heart. 
1PE.1.23	For through the eternal and living Word of God you have been born again. And this “seed” that he planted within you can never be destroyed but will live 
1PE.1.24	Human beings are 
1PE.1.24	and the glory of man 
1PE.1.24	like blossoms of the field.
1PE.1.24	The grass dries and withers and the flowers fall off,
1PE.1.25	but the Word of the Lord endures forever!
1PE.1.25	And this is the Word that was announced to you!
1PE.2.1	So abandon every form of evil, deceit, hypocrisy, feelings of jealousy and slander. 
1PE.2.2	In the same way that nursing infants cry for milk, you must intensely crave the pure spiritual milk 
1PE.2.3	especially now that you have had a taste of the goodness of the Lord Jehovah and have experienced his kindness.
1PE.2.4	So keep coming to him who is the Living Stone—though he was rejected and discarded by men but chosen by God and is priceless in God’s sight. 
1PE.2.5	Come and be his “living stones” who are continually being assembled into a sanctuary for God. For now you 
1PE.2.6	For it says in Scripture:
1PE.2.6	Look! I lay a cornerstone in Zion,
1PE.2.6	a chosen and priceless stone!
1PE.2.6	And whoever believes in him
1PE.2.6	will certainly not be disappointed.
1PE.2.7	As believers you know his great worth—indeed, his preciousness is 
1PE.2.7	The stone that the builders rejected and discarded
1PE.2.7	has now become the cornerstone
1PE.2.8	And
1PE.2.8	A stone that makes them stumble
1PE.2.8	and a rock to trip over.
1PE.2.8	They keep stumbling over the message because they refuse to believe it. And this they were destined to do. 
1PE.2.9	But you are God’s chosen treasure—priests who are kings, a spiritual “nation” set apart as God’s devoted ones. He called you out of darkness to experience his marvelous light, and now he claims you as his very own. He did this so that you would broadcast his glorious wonders 
1PE.2.10	For at one time you were not God’s people, but now you are. At one time you knew nothing of God’s mercy, because you hadn’t received it yet, but now you are drenched with it!
1PE.2.11	My divinely loved friends, since you are resident aliens and foreigners in this world, I appeal to you to divorce yourselves from the evil desires that wage war within you. 
1PE.2.12	Live honorable lives as you mix with unbelievers, even though they accuse you of being evildoers. For they will see your beautiful works and have a reason to glorify God in the day he visits us.
1PE.2.13	In order to honor the Lord, you must respect and defer to the authority of every human institution, whether it be the highest ruler 
1PE.2.14	or the governors he puts in place to punish lawbreakers and to praise those who do what’s right. 
1PE.2.15	For it is God’s will for you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.
1PE.2.16	As God’s 
1PE.2.17	Recognize the value of every person and continually show love to every believer. Live your lives with great reverence and in holy awe of God. Honor your rulers.
1PE.2.18	Those who are servants, submit to the authority of those who are your masters—not only to those who are kind and gentle but even to those who are hard and difficult. 
1PE.2.19	You find God’s favor by deciding to please God even when you endure hardships because of unjust suffering. 
1PE.2.20	For what merit is it to endure mistreatment for wrongdoing? Yet if you are mistreated when you do what is right, and you faithfully endure it, this is commendable before God. 
1PE.2.21	In fact, you were called to live this way, because Christ also suffered in your place, leaving you his example for you to follow.
1PE.2.22	He never sinned
1PE.2.22	and he never spoke deceitfully.
1PE.2.23	When he was verbally abused, he did not return with an insult; when he suffered, he would not threaten retaliation. Jesus faithfully entrusted himself into the hands of God, who judges righteously. 
1PE.2.24	He himself carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we would be dead to sin and live for righteousness. Our instant healing flowed from his wounding. 
1PE.2.25	You were like sheep that continually wandered away, but now you have returned to the 
1PE.3.1	And now let me speak to the wives. Be devoted to your own husbands, so that even if some of them do not obey the Word of God, your kind conduct may win them over without you saying a thing. 
1PE.3.2	For when they observe your pure, godly life before God, 
1PE.3.3+1PE.3.4	Let your true beauty come from your inner personality, not a focus on the external. For lasting beauty comes from a gentle and peaceful spirit, which is precious in God’s sight 
1PE.3.5	Holy women of long ago who had set their hopes in God beautified themselves with lives lived in deference to their own husbands’ authority. 
1PE.3.6	For example, our 
1PE.3.7	Husbands, you in turn must treat your wives with tenderness, viewing them as feminine partners who deserve to be honored, for they are co-heirs with you of the “
1PE.3.8	Now, this is the goal: to live in harmony with one another and demonstrate affectionate love, sympathy, and kindness toward other believers. Let humility describe who you are as you dearly love one another. 
1PE.3.9	Never retaliate when someone treats you wrongly, nor insult those who insult you, but instead, respond by speaking a blessing over them—because a blessing is what God promised to give you. 
1PE.3.10	For the Scriptures tell us:
1PE.3.10	Whoever wants to embrace true life
1PE.3.10	and find beauty in each day
1PE.3.11	must stop speaking evil, hurtful words
1PE.3.11	and never deceive in what they say.
1PE.3.11	Always turn from what is wrong
1PE.3.11	and cultivate what is good;
1PE.3.11	eagerly pursue peace in every relationship,
1PE.3.11	making it your prize.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord Yahweh rest upon the godly,
1PE.3.12	and his heart responds to their prayers.
1PE.3.12	But he turns his back on those who practice evil.
1PE.3.13	Why would anyone harm you if you’re passionate and devoted to pleasing God? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you will have the 
1PE.3.14	Don’t be intimidated or terrified
1PE.3.14	by those who would terrify you.
1PE.3.15	But give reverent honor in your hearts to the Anointed One and treat him as the holy Master 
1PE.3.16	with gentleness and respect. Maintain a clean conscience, so that those who slander you for living a pure life in Christ will have to lie about you and will be ashamed because of their slander. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is in God’s plan, than for doing evil.
1PE.3.18	Christ suffered and died for sins once and for all—the innocent for the guilty—to bring you near to God by his body being put to death and by being raised to life by the Spirit. 
1PE.3.19	He went in the spiritual realm and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison 
1PE.3.20	because of their disobedience of long ago. For during the time of Noah God patiently waited while the ark was being prepared, but only a few were brought safely through the floodwaters: a total of eight souls. 
1PE.3.21	This was a prophetic picture of the immersion that now saves you—not a bathing of the physical body but rather the response of a good conscience before God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
1PE.3.22	who is now in heaven at the place of supreme authority next to God. The very powers of heaven, including every angel and authority, now yield in submission to him.
1PE.4.1	Since Christ, 
1PE.4.2	So live the rest of your earthly life no longer concerned with human desires but 
1PE.4.3	For you have already spent enough time doing what unbelievers love to do—living in debauchery, sensuality, partying, drunkenness, wild drinking parties, and the worship of demons. 
1PE.4.4	They marvel that you no longer rush to join them in the excesses of their corrupt lifestyles, and so they vilify you. 
1PE.4.5	But one day they will have to give an account to the one who is destined to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	This is the reason the gospel was preached to the 
1PE.4.7	Since we are approaching the end of all things, be intentional, purposeful, and self-controlled so that you can be given to prayer.
1PE.4.8	Above all, constantly echo 
1PE.4.9	Be compassionate to foreigners without complaining.
1PE.4.10	Every believer has received grace gifts, so use them to serve one another as faithful stewards of the many-colored tapestry of God’s grace.
1PE.4.11	, if you have a speaking 
1PE.4.12	Beloved friends, if life gets extremely difficult, with many tests, don’t be bewildered as though something strange were overwhelming you. 
1PE.4.13	Instead, continue to rejoice, for you, in a measure, have shared in the sufferings of the Anointed One so that 
1PE.4.14	If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are greatly blessed, because the Spirit of glory and power, who is the Spirit of God, rests upon you.
1PE.4.15	Let none of you merit suffering as a murderer, or thief, or criminal, or as one who meddles in the affairs of others. 
1PE.4.16	If you suffer for being a Christian, don’t consider it a disgrace but 
1PE.4.17	For the time is ripe for judgment to begin in God’s own household. And if it starts with us, what will be the fate of those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?
1PE.4.18	And:
1PE.4.18	If the righteous are barely saved,
1PE.4.18	what will become of the wicked and godless?
1PE.4.19	So then, those who suffer for following God’s will should enfold their lives into the Creator, who will never fail them, and continue to always do what is right.
1PE.5.1	Now, I encourage you as an elder, an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ, and one who shares in the glory that is about to be unveiled. I urge my fellow elders among you 
1PE.5.2	to be 
1PE.5.3	Don’t be controlling tyrants but lead others by your beautiful examples to the flock. 
1PE.5.4	And when the Shepherd-King appears, you will win the victor’s crown of glory that never fades away.
1PE.5.5	In the same way, the younger ones should willingly support the leadership of the elders. In every relationship, each of you must wrap around yourself the apron of a humble servant. Because:
1PE.5.5	God resists you when you are proud
1PE.5.5	but multiplies grace and favor when you are humble.
1PE.5.6	If you bow low in God’s awesome presence, he will eventually exalt you as you leave the timing in his hands.
1PE.5.7	Pour out all your worries and stress upon him 
1PE.5.8	Be well balanced and always alert, because your enemy, the devil, roams around incessantly, like a roaring lion looking for its prey to devour. 
1PE.5.9	Take a decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong, vigorous faith. For you know that your believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kinds of troubles you endure. 
1PE.5.10	And then, after your brief suffering, the God of all loving grace, who has called you to share in his eternal glory in Christ, will personally and powerfully restore you and make you stronger than ever. Yes, he will set you firmly in place and build you up. 
1PE.5.11	And he has all the power needed to do this—forever! Amen.
1PE.5.12	I, Peter, with the help of Silas, whom I consider a trustworthy, faith-filled brother, have written you this short letter so that I might encourage you and personally testify that this is the true, dependable grace of God. Stand fast in this grace.
1PE.5.13	She who is in Babylon, who is co-elect with you, sends her greetings, along with Mark, my son.
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of peace.
1PE.5.14	Peace to all who are in life union with Christ. Amen.
2PE.1.1	 Simeon Peter, a 
2PE.1.2	May grace and perfect peace cascade over you as you 
2PE.1.3	Everything we could ever need for life and godliness has already been deposited in us by his divine power. 
2PE.1.4	As a result of this, he has given you magnificent promises that are beyond all price, so that through 
2PE.1.5	So devote yourselves to lavishly supplementing your faith with goodness,
2PE.1.5	and to goodness add understanding,
2PE.1.6	and to understanding add the strength of self-control,
2PE.1.6	and to self-control add patient endurance,
2PE.1.6	and to patient endurance add godliness,
2PE.1.7	and to godliness add mercy toward your brothers and sisters,
2PE.1.7	and to mercy toward others add unending love.
2PE.1.8	Since these virtues are already 
2PE.1.9	But if anyone lacks these things, he is blind, constantly closing his eyes to the mysteries of our faith, and forgetting 
2PE.1.10	For this reason, beloved ones, be eager to confirm and validate that God has invited you 
2PE.1.11	As a result, the kingdom’s gates will open wide to you as God choreographs your triumphant entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah.
2PE.1.12	I won’t hesitate to continually remind you of these truths, even though you are aware of them and are well established in the present measure of truth you have already embraced. 
2PE.1.13	And as long as I live I will continue to awaken you with this reminder, 
2PE.1.14	since our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has clearly revealed that my departure is near. 
2PE.1.15	Indeed, I’m passionate to share these things with you so that you will always remember them after my exodus from this life.
2PE.1.16	We were not retelling some masterfully crafted legend when we informed you of the power and appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we saw his magnificence and splendor 
2PE.1.17	Yes, Father God lavished upon him radiant glory and honor when his distinct voice spoke out of the realm of majestic glory, endorsing him with these words: This is my cherished Son, marked by my love. All my delight is found in him! 
2PE.1.18	And we ourselves heard that voice resound from the heavens while we were with him on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.19	And so we have been given the prophetic word—the 
2PE.1.20	You must understand this at the outset: Interpretation of scriptural prophecy 
2PE.1.21	No true prophecy comes from human initiative but is inspired by the moving of the Holy Spirit upon those who spoke the message that came from God.
2PE.2.1	In the past there arose false prophets among 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow immoral lifestyles. Because of these 
2PE.2.3	They are only out for themselves, ready to exploit you for their own gain through their cunning arguments. Their condemnation has been a long time coming. But their destruction does not slumber or sit idly by, 
2PE.2.4	Now, 
2PE.2.5	And he did not spare the former world 
2PE.2.6	And 
2PE.2.7	Yet he rescued a righteous man, Lot, suffering the indignity of the unbridled lusts of the lawless. 
2PE.2.8	For righteous Lot lived among them day after day, distressed in his righteous soul by the rebellious deeds he saw and heard.
2PE.2.9	If the Lord Yahweh 
2PE.2.10	And this especially applies to those who live their lives despising authorities and who abandon themselves to chasing the depraved lusts of their flesh.
2PE.2.10	They are willfully arrogant and insolent, unafraid to insult the glorious ones. 
2PE.2.11	Yet even angels, who are greater than they in power and strength, do not dare slander them before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	These individuals are nothing but brute beasts—irrational creatures, born in the wild to be caught and destroyed—and they will perish like beasts. They are professional insulters, who slander whatever they don’t understand, and in their destruction they will be destroyed. 
2PE.2.13	For all the evil they have done will come crashing down on them. They consider it their great pleasure to carouse in broad daylight. When they come to your love feasts they are but stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions as they feast with you. 
2PE.2.14	They are addicted to adultery, with eyes that are insatiable, with sins that never end. They seduce the vulnerable and are experts in their greed—they are but children of a curse!
2PE.2.15	They have wandered off the main road and have gone astray, because they are prophets who love profit—the wages they earn by wrongdoing. They are following the example of Balaam, son of Beor, 
2PE.2.16	who was rebuked for evil by a donkey incapable of speech yet that spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
2PE.2.17	These people are dried-up riverbeds, waterless clouds pushed along by stormy winds—the deepest darkness of gloom has been prepared for them. 
2PE.2.18	They spout off with their grandiose, impressive nonsense. Consumed with the lusts of the flesh, they lure 
2PE.2.19	They promise others freedom, yet they themselves are slaves to corruption, for people are slaves to whatever overcomes them.
2PE.2.20	Those who escape the corrupting forces of this world system through the experience of knowing about our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah, then go back into entanglement with them and are defeated by them, becoming worse off than they were to start with. 
2PE.2.21	It would have been much better for them never to have experienced the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred obligation that was given to them. 
2PE.2.22	They become illustrations of the true proverb:
2PE.2.22	A dog will return to his own vomit
2PE.2.22	and a washed pig to its rolling in the mud.
2PE.3.1	Beloved friends, this is now the second letter I have written to you in which I’ve attempted to stir you up and awaken you to a proper mind-set. 
2PE.3.2	So never forget both the prophecies spoken by the holy prophets of old and the teaching of our Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.
2PE.3.3	Above all, you must understand that in the last days mockers will multiply, chasing after their evil desires. 
2PE.3.4	They will say, “So what about this promise of his coming? Our ancestors are dead and buried, yet everything is still the same as it was since from the beginning of time until now.”
2PE.3.5	But they conveniently overlook that from the beginning, the heavens and earth were created by God’s word. 
2PE.3.6	Then long afterward he destroyed the world with a tremendous flood by those very waters. 
2PE.3.7	And now, by the same 
2PE.3.8	So, dear friends, don’t let this one thing escape your notice: a single day counts like a thousand years to the Lord Yahweh, and a thousand years counts as one day. 
2PE.3.9	This means that, 
2PE.3.10	The day of the Lord will come and take everyone by surprise—as unexpected as a home invasion. The atmosphere will be set on fire and vanish with a horrific roar, and the heavenly bodies will melt away as in a tremendous blaze. The earth and every activity of man will be laid bare. 
2PE.3.11	Since all these things are on the verge of being dismantled, don’t you see how vital it is to live a holy life? We must be consumed with godliness 
2PE.3.12	while we anticipate and help to speed up the coming of the day of God, when the atmosphere will be set on fire and the heavenly bodies consumed in a blaze. 
2PE.3.13	But as we wait, we trust in God’s royal proclamation to be fulfilled. There are coming heavens new in quality, and an earth new in quality, where righteousness will be fully at home.
2PE.3.14	So, my beloved friends, with all that you have to look forward to, may you be eager to be found living pure lives 
2PE.3.15	And keep in mind that our Lord’s extraordinary patience simply means 
2PE.3.16	He consistently speaks of these things in all of his letters, even though he writes some concepts that are overwhelming to our understanding, which the unlearned and unstable love to twist to their 
2PE.3.17	As for you, divinely loved ones, since you are forewarned of these things, be careful that you are not led astray by the error of the lawless and lose your firm grip 
2PE.3.18	But continue to grow and increase in God’s grace and intimacy with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. May he receive all the glory both now and until the day eternity begins. Amen!
1JN.1.1	We saw him with our very own eyes.
1JN.1.1	We gazed upon him and heard him speak.
1JN.1.1	Our hands actually touched him,
1JN.1.1	the one who was from the beginning,
1JN.1.1	the Living Expression of God.
1JN.1.2	This Life-Giver was made visible
1JN.1.2	and we have seen him.
1JN.1.2	We testify to this truth:
1JN.1.2	the eternal Life-Giver
1JN.1.2	lived face-to-face with the Father
1JN.1.2	and has now dawned upon us.
1JN.1.3	So we proclaim to you
1JN.1.3	what we have seen and heard
1JN.1.3	so that we may share and enjoy
1JN.1.3	this life together.
1JN.1.3	For truly our fellowship is with the Father
1JN.1.3	and with his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One.
1JN.1.4	We are writing these things to you because we want to release to you our fullness of joy.
1JN.1.5	This is the life-giving message we heard him share 
1JN.1.6	If we claim that we share life with him, but keep walking in the realm of darkness, we’re fooling ourselves and not living the truth. 
1JN.1.7	But if we keep living in the pure light that surrounds him, we share 
1JN.1.8	If we boast that we have no sin, we’re only fooling ourselves and are strangers to the truth. 
1JN.1.9	But if we freely admit our sins 
1JN.1.10	If we claim that we’re not guilty of sin 
1JN.2.1	You are my dear children, and I write these things to you so that you won’t sin. But if anyone does sin, we continually have a forgiving Redeemer who is face-to-face with the Father: Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 
1JN.2.2	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
1JN.2.3	Here’s how we can be sure that we’ve truly come to know God: if we keep his commands. 
1JN.2.4	If someone claims, “I have come to know God 
1JN.2.5	But the love of God will be perfected within the one who obeys God’s Word.
1JN.2.5	We can be sure that we’ve truly come to live in 
1JN.2.6	not just by saying, “I am intimate with God,” but by walking in the footsteps of Jesus.
1JN.2.7	Beloved, I’m not writing a new commandment to you, but an old one that you had from the beginning, and you’ve already heard it. 
1JN.2.8	Yet, in a sense, it is a new commandment, as its truth is made manifest both in Christ and in you, because the darkness is disappearing and the true light is already blazing.
1JN.2.9	Anyone who says, “I am in the light,” while holding hatred in his heart toward a fellow believer is still in the darkness. 
1JN.2.10	But the one who truly loves a fellow believer lives in the light, and there is nothing in him that will cause someone else to stumble. 
1JN.2.11	But whoever hates a fellow believer lives in the darkness—stumbling around in the dark with no clue where he is going, for he is blinded by the darkness.
1JN.2.12	I remind you, dear children: your sins have been permanently removed because of the power of his name.
1JN.2.13	I remind you, fathers 
1JN.2.13	And I remind you, young people: you have defeated the Evil One.
1JN.2.14	I write these things to you, dear children, because you truly have a relationship with the Father. I write these things, fathers 
1JN.2.15	Don’t set the affections of your heart on this world or in loving the things of the world. The love of the Father and the love of the world are incompatible. 
1JN.2.16	For all that the world can offer us—the gratification of our flesh, the allurement of the things of the world, and the obsession with status and importance—none of these things come from the Father but from the world. 
1JN.2.17	This world and its desires are in the process of passing away, but those who 
1JN.2.18	Dear children, the end 
1JN.2.19	, they withdrew from us because they were never really of our number. For if they had truly belonged to us they would have continued with us. By leaving our community of believers they made it obvious that they never really belonged to us.
1JN.2.20	But the Holy One has anointed you and you all know 
1JN.2.21	So I’m writing you not because you don’t know the truth, but because you do know it, and no lie belongs to the truth.
1JN.2.22	Who is the real liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. He is the real antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 
1JN.2.23	Whoever rejects the Son rejects the Father. Whoever embraces the Son embraces the Father also. 
1JN.2.24	So you must be sure to keep the message burning in your hearts; that is, the message 
1JN.2.25	And he himself has promised us the never-ending life of the ages to come!
1JN.2.26	I’ve written these things about those who are attempting to lead you astray. 
1JN.2.27	But the wonderful anointing you have received from God 
1JN.2.28	And now, dear children, remain in him, so that when he is revealed we may have joyful confidence and not be ashamed when we stand before him at his appearing.
1JN.2.29	If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who lives in righteousness has been divinely fathered by him.
1JN.3.1	Look with wonder at the depth of the Father’s marvelous love that he has lavished on us! He has called us and made us his very own 
1JN.3.2	Beloved, we are God’s children right now; however, it is not yet apparent what we will become. But we do know that when it is finally made visible, we will be just like him, for we will see him as he truly is. 
1JN.3.3	And all who focus their hope on him will always be purifying themselves, just as Jesus is pure.
1JN.3.4	Anyone who indulges in sin lives in moral anarchy, for 
1JN.3.5	And you know without a doubt that Jesus was revealed to eradicate sins, and there is no sin in him. Anyone who continues to live in union with him will not sin. 
1JN.3.6	But the one who continues sinning hasn’t seen him 
1JN.3.7	Delightfully loved children, don’t let anyone divert you from this truth. The person who keeps doing what is right 
1JN.3.8	But the one who indulges in a sinful life is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was revealed was to undo and destroy the works of the devil.
1JN.3.9	Everyone who is truly God’s child will refuse to keep sinning because God’s seed remains within him, and he is unable to continue sinning because he has been fathered by God himself. 
1JN.3.10	Here is how God’s children can be clearly distinguished from the children of the Evil One. Anyone who does not demonstrate righteousness and show love to fellow believers is not living with God as his source.
1JN.3.11	The beautiful message you’ve heard right from the start is that we should walk in self-sacrificing love toward one another. 
1JN.3.12	We should not be like Cain, who yielded to the Evil One and brutally murdered his own brother, 
1JN.3.13	So don’t be shocked, beloved brothers and sisters, if you experience the world’s hatred. 
1JN.3.14	Yet we can be assured that we have been translated from 
1JN.3.15	Everyone who keeps hating a fellow believer is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.
1JN.3.16	This is how we have discovered love’s reality: Jesus sacrificed his life for us. Because of this great love, we should be willing to lay down our lives for one another. 
1JN.3.17	If anyone sees a fellow believer in need and has the means to help him, yet shows no pity and closes his heart against him, how is it even possible that God’s love lives in him?
1JN.3.18	Beloved children, our love can’t be an abstract theory we only talk about, but a way of life demonstrated through our loving deeds. 
1JN.3.19	We know that the truth lives within us because we demonstrate love in action, which will reassure our hearts in his presence.
1JN.3.20	Whenever our hearts make us feel guilty 
1JN.3.21	My delightfully loved friends, when our hearts don’t condemn us, we have a bold freedom to speak face-to-face with God. 
1JN.3.22	And whatever we ask of him we receive, because we keep his commands. And by our beautiful intentions we continue to do what brings pleasure to him.
1JN.3.23	So these are his commands: that we continually place our trust in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we keep loving one another, just as he has commanded us. 
1JN.3.24	For all who obey his commands find their lives joined in union with him, and he lives and flourishes in them. We know and have proof that he constantly lives and flourishes in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.
1JN.4.1	Delightfully loved friends, don’t trust every spirit, but carefully examine 
1JN.4.2	Here’s the test for those with the genuine Spirit of God: they will confess Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh. 
1JN.4.3	Everyone who does not acknowledge that Jesus is from God has the spirit of antichrist, which you heard was coming and is already active in the world.
1JN.4.4	Little children, 
1JN.4.5	They belong to this world and they articulate the spirit of this world, and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	But we belong to God, and whoever truly knows God listens to us. Those who refuse to listen to us do not belong to God. That is how we can know the difference between the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.
1JN.4.7	Those who are loved by God, let his love continually pour from you to one another, because God is love. Everyone who loves is fathered by God and experiences an intimate knowledge of him. 
1JN.4.8	The one who doesn’t love has yet to know God, for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	The light of God’s love shined within us when he sent his matchless Son into the world so that we might live through him. 
1JN.4.10	This is love: He loved us 
1JN.4.11	Delightfully loved ones, if he loved us with such tremendous love, then “loving one another” should be our way of life! 
1JN.4.12	No one has ever gazed upon the fullness of God’s splendor. But if we love one another, God makes his permanent home in us, and we make our permanent home in him, and his love is brought to its full expression in us. 
1JN.4.13	And he has given us his Spirit within us so that we can have the assurance that he lives in us and that we live in him.
1JN.4.14	Moreover, we have seen with our own eyes and can testify to the truth that Father God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	Those who give thanks that Jesus is the Son of God live in God, and God lives in them. 
1JN.4.16	We have come into an intimate experience with God’s love, and we trust in the love he has for us.
1JN.4.16	God is love! Those who are living in love are living in God, and God lives through them. 
1JN.4.17	By 
1JN.4.18	Love never brings fear, for fear is always related to punishment. But love’s perfection drives the fear 
1JN.4.19	Our love for others is 
1JN.4.20	Anyone can say, “I love God,” yet have hatred toward another believer. This makes him a phony, because if you don’t love a brother or sister, whom you can see, how can you truly love God, whom you can’t see? 
1JN.4.21	For he has given us this command: whoever loves God must also demonstrate love to others.
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah is God’s spiritual child and has been fathered by God himself. And everyone who loves Father God loves his children as well. 
1JN.5.2	This is how we can be sure that we love the children of God: by having a passionate love for God and by obedience to his commands. 
1JN.5.3	True love for God means obeying his commands, and his commands don’t weigh us down as heavy burdens. 
1JN.5.4	, every child of God overcomes the world, for our faith is the victorious power that triumphs over the world. 
1JN.5.5	So who are the world conquerors, 
1JN.5.6	Jesus Christ is the One who was revealed 
1JN.5.7	So we have these three constant witnesses giving their evidence: 
1JN.5.8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood. And these three are in agreement. 
1JN.5.9	If we accept the testimony of men, 
1JN.5.10	Those who believe in the Son of God have the 
1JN.5.11	This is the true testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	Whoever has the Son has 
1JN.5.13	I’ve written this letter to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you will 
1JN.5.14	Since we have this confidence, we can also have great boldness before him, for if we ask anything agreeable to his will, he will hear us. 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have obtained the requests we ask of him.
1JN.5.16	If anyone observes a fellow believer habitually sinning in a way that doesn’t lead to death, you should keep interceding in prayer that God will give that person life. Now, there is a sin that leads to death, and I’m not encouraging you to pray for those who commit it. 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does not result in death.
1JN.5.18	We are convinced that everyone fathered by God does not make sinning a way of life, because the Son of God protects the child of God, and the Evil One cannot touch him. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are God’s children and that the whole world lies under the misery and influence of the Evil One. 
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God has made our understanding come alive so that we can know by experience the One who is true. And we are in him who is true, God’s Son, Jesus Christ—the true God and eternal life!
1JN.5.21	So, little children, guard yourselves from worshiping anything but him.
2JN.1.1	From the elder to God’s chosen woman and her children:
2JN.1.1	I love you all 
2JN.1.2	because of the 
2JN.1.3	God our Father and Jesus Christ, his Son, will release to us 
2JN.1.4	I was delighted and filled with joy when I learned that your children are consistently living in the truth, just as we have received the command from the Father.
2JN.1.5	Dearest woman, I have a request to make of you. It is not a new commandment but a repetition of the one we have had from the beginning: that we constantly love one another. 
2JN.1.6	This love means living in obedience to whatever God commands us. For to walk in love toward one another is the unifying commandment we’ve heard from the beginning.
2JN.1.7	Numerous deceivers have surfaced 
2JN.1.8	Be on your guard so that you do not lose all that we have 
2JN.1.9	Anyone who wanders away and does not remain faithful to the teaching of Christ has no relationship with God. But those who remain in the teaching of Christ have a 
2JN.1.10	So if anyone comes 
2JN.1.11	For if you welcome him as a believer, you will be partnering with him in his evil agenda.
2JN.1.12	Although I have many more subjects I’d like to discuss with you, I’d rather not include them in this letter. But I look forward to coming to visit and speaking with you face-to-face—for being together will complete our joy!
2JN.1.13	The children of your sister, whom God has chosen, send you their loving greetings. Amen.
3JN.1.1	From the elder to my dearly loved brother Gaius, whom I truly love:
3JN.1.2	Beloved friend, I pray that you are prospering in every way and that you continually enjoy good health, just as your soul is prospering.
3JN.1.3	I was filled with joy and delight when the brothers arrived and informed me of your 
3JN.1.4	It is the greatest joy of my life to hear that my children are consistently living their lives in the ways of truth!
3JN.1.5	My beloved friend, 
3JN.1.6	They have shared publicly with the congregation about the beautiful acts of love you have shown them. Now, if you would be so kind, send them on their way 
3JN.1.7	You see, it was their passion for 
3JN.1.8	They are deserving of all the support we can give them, 
3JN.1.9	I have already written you once about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be in charge and recognized as first among you, does not acknowledge our authority. 
3JN.1.10	So if I come, I will address what he’s doing—spreading his malicious slander against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome our brothers, and he stands in the way of those who want to receive them and show them hospitality by throwing them out of the church!
3JN.1.11	Delightfully loved ones, don’t imitate what is evil, but imitate that which is good. Whoever does good is of God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
3JN.1.12	As for Demetrius, everyone speaks very highly of him, and even the truth itself stands by his side. We too wholeheartedly endorse him, and you know that our recommendation is reliable.
3JN.1.13	Although I have many more subjects I’d like to discuss with you, I’d rather not include them in this letter. 
3JN.1.14	Instead, I hope to visit you and speak with you face-to-face.
3JN.1.15	Peace to you, 
JUD.1.1	From Judah, a loving servant of Jesus, the Anointed One, and brother of James. 
JUD.1.2	May God’s mercy, peace, and love cascade over you!
JUD.1.3	Dearly loved friend, I was fully intending to write to you about our 
JUD.1.4	There have been some who have sneaked in among you unnoticed. They are depraved people whose judgment was prophesied in Scripture a long time ago. They have perverted 
JUD.1.5	I need to remind you, even though you are familiar with it all, that 
JUD.1.6	In the same way, there were heavenly messengers 
JUD.1.7	In a similar way, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and nearby towns gave themselves to sexual immorality and the unnatural desire of different flesh. Now they all serve as examples of those who experience the punishment of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	In the same way, these sensual “dreamers” corrupt and pollute the natural realm, while on the other hand they reject the 
JUD.1.9	Even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil over the body of Moses, dared not insult or slander him, but simply said, “The Lord Yahweh rebuke you!”
JUD.1.10	These people insult anything they don’t understand. They behave like irrational beasts by doing whatever they feel like doing. Because they live by their animal instincts, they corrupt themselves and bring about their own destruction. 
JUD.1.11	How terrible it is for them! For they have followed in the steps of Cain. They have abandoned themselves to Balaam’s error because of their greedy pursuit of financial gain. 
JUD.1.12	These false teachers are like dangerous hidden reefs at your love feasts, 
JUD.1.13	They are wild waves of the sea, flinging out the foam of their shame and disgrace. They are 
JUD.1.14	Enoch, the seventh direct descendant from Adam, prophesied of their doom when he said, “Look! Here comes the Lord Yahweh with his countless myriads of holy ones. 
JUD.1.15	 to execute judgment against them all and to convict each one of them for their ungodly deeds and for all the terrible words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
JUD.1.16	These people are always complaining and never satisfied—finding fault with everyone. They follow their own evil desires and their mouths speak scandalous things. They 
JUD.1.17	But you, 
JUD.1.18	They taught you, “In the last days there will always be mockers, motivated by their own ungodly desires.” 
JUD.1.19	These people cause divisions and are followers of their own natural instincts, devoid of 
JUD.1.20	But you, 
JUD.1.21	Fasten your hearts to the love of God and receive the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives us eternal life.
JUD.1.22	Keep being compassionate to those who still have doubts, 
JUD.1.23	and snatch others out of the fire to save them. Be merciful over and over to them, but always couple your mercy with the fear of God. Be extremely careful to keep yourselves free from the pollutions of the flesh.
JUD.1.24	Now, to the one with enough power to prevent you from stumbling 
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Savior, through our Lord Jesus Christ, be 
REV.1.1	This is the unveiling of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to share with his loving servants what must occur swiftly. He signified it by sending his angel to his loving servant John. 
REV.1.2	I, John, bore witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
REV.1.3	A joyous blessing rests upon the one who reads 
REV.1.4	From John to the seven churches in western Turkey: May 
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ the Faithful Witness, the Firstborn from among the dead and the ruling King, who rules over the kings of the earth!
REV.1.5	Now to the one who 
REV.1.6	 has appointed us as a kingdom of priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and dominion throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!
REV.1.7	Behold! He appears within the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him. And all the people groups of the earth will weep with sorrow because of him. And so it is to be! Amen.
REV.1.8	“I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the ending,” says the Lord God, “who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”
REV.1.9	I, John, am your brother and companion in tribulation, the kingdom, and the patience that are 
REV.1.10	I was in the spirit realm on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice sounding like a trumpet, 
REV.1.11	saying to me:
REV.1.12	When I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, I saw seven golden lampstands. 
REV.1.13	And walking among the lampstands, I saw someone like a son of man, wearing a full-length robe with a golden sash over his chest. 
REV.1.14	His head and his hair were white like wool—white as glistening snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire! 
REV.1.15	His feet were gleaming like bright metal, as though they were glowing in a fire, and his voice was like the roar of many rushing waters. 
REV.1.16	In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. And his face was shining like the brightness of the blinding sun! 
REV.1.17	When I saw him, I fell down at his feet as good as dead, but he laid his right hand on me and 
REV.4.1	Then suddenly, after I wrote down these messages, I saw a heavenly portal open before me, and the same trumpet-voice I heard speaking with me at the beginning 
REV.4.2	Instantly I was taken into the spirit realm, and behold—I saw a heavenly throne set in place and someone seated upon it. 
REV.4.3	His appearance was 
REV.4.4	Encircling the great throne were twenty-four thrones with elders in 
REV.4.5	And 
REV.4.6	And in front of the throne there was 
REV.4.6	Around the throne and on each side stood four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind. 
REV.4.7	The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox, the third had a human face, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight. 
REV.4.8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings, full of eyes all around and under their wings. They worshiped without ceasing, day and night, singing,
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty!
REV.4.8	The Was, the Is, and the Coming!”
REV.4.9	And whenever the living creatures gave glory, honor, and thanks to the One who is enthroned and who lives forever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fell facedown before the one seated on the throne and they worshiped the one who lives forever and ever. And they surrendered their crowns before the throne, singing:
REV.4.11	“You are worthy, our Lord and God,
REV.4.11	to receive glory, honor, and power,
REV.4.11	for you created all things,
REV.4.11	and by your plan they were created and exist.”
REV.5.1	And I saw that the one seated on the throne was holding in his right hand an unopened scroll with writing on the inside and on the outside, and it was sealed with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	Then I saw an incredibly powerful angel proclaiming with a great, loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its 
REV.5.3	But no person could be found, living or dead, in all of creation—no one was worthy to open the scroll and read its contents. 
REV.5.4	So I broke down weeping with intense sorrow, because there was found no one worthy to break open the scroll and read its contents.
REV.5.5	Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping. Look! The mighty Lion of Judah’s tribe, the root of David—he has conquered! He is the worthy one who can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
REV.5.6	Then I saw a young Lamb standing in the middle of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. He appeared to have been slaughtered 
REV.5.7	I saw the young Lamb approach the throne and take the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat there. 
REV.5.8	And when the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures saw the Lamb had taken the scroll, they fell facedown at the feet of the Lamb and worshiped him. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls brimming full of sweet fragrant incense—which are the prayers of God’s holy lovers. 
REV.5.9	And they were all singing this new song 
REV.5.9	“Because you were slaughtered for us,
REV.5.9	you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals.
REV.5.9	Your blood was the price paid to redeem us.
REV.5.9	You purchased us to bring us to God
REV.5.9	out of every tribe, language, people group, and nation.
REV.5.10	You have chosen us to serve our God
REV.5.10	and formed us into a kingdom of priests
REV.5.10	who reign on the earth.”
REV.5.11	Then I looked, and I heard the voices of myriads of angels in circles around the throne, as well as the voices of the living creatures and the elders—myriads and myriads! 
REV.5.12	And as I watched, all of them were singing with thunderous voices:
REV.5.12	“Worthy is Christ the Lamb who was slaughtered to receive great power and might, wealth and wisdom, and honor, glory, and praise!”
REV.5.13	Then every living being joined the angelic choir. Every creature in heaven and on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and everything in them, were 
REV.5.13	“Praise, honor, glory, and dominion
REV.5.13	be to God-Enthroned
REV.5.13	and to Christ the Lamb
REV.5.13	forever and ever!”
REV.5.14	Then the four living creatures responded:
REV.5.14	“Amen!”
REV.5.14	And the twenty-four elders threw themselves facedown to the ground and worshiped.
REV.6.1	Then I watched as the Lamb broke open the first of the seven seals. Immediately I heard one of the four living creatures call out with a powerful voice of revelation sounding like thunder, saying, “Come forth!” 
REV.6.2	So I looked, and behold, there was a bright white horse. Its rider had a bow and was given a crown of victory. He rode out as a conqueror ready to conquer.
REV.6.3	When he broke open the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out: “Come forth!” 
REV.6.4	And there appeared another horse, red 
REV.6.5	Then he broke open the third seal, and I heard the third living creature call out, “Come forth!” And behold, I saw a black horse right in front of me, and its rider was holding measuring scales. 
REV.6.6	And I heard what seemed to be a voice from among the living creatures saying, “A small measure of wheat for a day’s pay, and three measures of barley for a day’s pay, but don’t harm the olive trees producing oil and the vines producing wine.”
REV.6.7	When he broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, “Come forth!” 
REV.6.8	And behold, I saw a green horse, and its rider’s name was Death, and Death’s Domain followed him. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, death, and by the wild beasts.
REV.6.9	When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw gathered under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because they had the testimony of the Lamb. 
REV.6.10	They cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Sovereign Lord, holy and dependable, how long before you judge those who live on the earth and vindicate our blood on them?”
REV.6.11	Each one was given a glistening white robe. And they were told to rest a little longer, until the full number was fulfilled of both their fellow servants and brothers and sisters who were going to be killed just as they had been.
REV.6.12	And behold! I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal, which released a powerful earthquake. I saw the sun become pitch black and the full moon become bloodred. 
REV.6.13	The stars fell from heaven to the earth, as a fig tree shaken by a stormy wind sheds its unripe figs. 
REV.6.14	The sky receded with a snap—as a scroll rolls itself up. And every mountain and island was moved from its place. 
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth and its great princes and generals, the rich and powerful, and everyone, whether they were slave or free, ran for cover and hid in the caves and among the mountain boulders. 
REV.6.16	They called out to the mountains and the boulders, saying, “Fall on us at once! Hide us quickly from the glorious face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, 
REV.6.17	for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”
REV.7.1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, and they were restraining the four winds so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree. 
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, who had the seal of the living God. He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea, 
REV.7.3	saying, “Do not damage the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the loving servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.”
REV.7.4	And I discovered the number of those who were sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel’s people.
REV.7.5	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah.
REV.7.5	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Reuben.
REV.7.5	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Gad.
REV.7.6	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Asher.
REV.7.6	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Naphtali.
REV.7.6	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Manasseh.
REV.7.7	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Simeon.
REV.7.7	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Levi.
REV.7.7	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Issachar.
REV.7.8	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Zebulun.
REV.7.8	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Joseph.
REV.7.8	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Benjamin.
REV.7.9	After this I looked, and behold, right in front of me I saw a vast multitude of people—an enormous multitude so huge that no one could count—made up of 
REV.7.10	And they shouted out with a passionate voice:
REV.7.10	“Salvation belongs to our God
REV.7.10	seated on the throne
REV.7.10	and to the Lamb!”
REV.7.11	All the angels were standing in a circle around the throne with the elders and the four living creatures, and they all fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	singing:
REV.7.12	“Amen! Praise and glory,
REV.7.12	wisdom and thanksgiving,
REV.7.12	honor, power, and might
REV.7.12	belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!”
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these in glistening white robes, and where have they come from?”
REV.7.14	I answered, “My lord—you must know.”
REV.7.14	Then he said to me, “They are ones who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb and have emerged from the midst of great pressure and ordeal. 
REV.7.15	For this reason they are before the throne of God, ministering to him as priests day and night, within his cloud-filled sanctuary. And the enthroned One spreads over them his tabernacle-shelter. 
REV.7.16	Their souls will be completely satisfied. And neither the sun nor any scorching heat will affect them. 
REV.7.17	For the Lamb at the center of the throne continuously shepherds them unto life—guiding them to the everlasting fountains of the water of life. And God will wipe from their eyes every last tear!”
REV.8.1	When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal, heaven fell silent for about half an hour. 
REV.8.2	And then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and each was given a trumpet.
REV.8.3	Then the eighth angel with a golden incense burner came and took his place at the incense altar. He was given a great quantity of incense to offer up, consisting of the prayers of God’s holy people, upon the golden altar that is before the throne. 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the holy ones billowed up before God from the hand of the angel. 
REV.8.5	Then the angel filled the golden incense burner with 
REV.8.6	Then the seven angels prepared to sound their trumpets. 
REV.8.7	When the first angel sounded his trumpet, there came forth hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, destroying a third of the trees and all green grass.
REV.8.8	When the second angel sounded his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with 
REV.8.9	A third of the sea turned into blood, destroying a third of all sea creatures.
REV.8.10	The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a megastar, blazing like a torch, descended from heaven upon a third of the rivers and fountains. 
REV.8.11	The name of the star is Bitterness. A third of the waters became so bitter that many people died.
REV.8.12	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened, and there was no light for a third of the day and likewise the night. 
REV.8.13	Then I saw and heard an eagle flying overhead, crying out with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe, to the people of the earth, because of the next three trumpets about to be sounded by the other three angels!”
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that fell from heaven to earth, and he was handed the key to the shaft leading down to the pit of the deep. 
REV.9.2	He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and a 
REV.9.3	And out of smoke appeared locusts 
REV.9.4	They were told not to harm the grass, or any green growth or any tree, but only to afflict those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	The locusts were given authority to torment them for five months, but not to kill them. Their painful torment is like the scorpion’s sting, 
REV.9.6	and during that time people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die but death will elude them.
REV.9.7	The locusts had the appearance of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were what seemed like golden crowns. And their faces were like human faces. 
REV.9.8	Their hair 
REV.9.9	They wore breastplates that seemed like iron, and their wings made a sound like the noise of horses and chariots rushing into battle. 
REV.9.10	They had tails and stingers like scorpions, with power to injure people for five months. 
REV.9.11	The angel of the bottomless pit was king over them, and his name in Hebrew is Destruction and in Greek Destroyer. 
REV.9.12	This is but the first woe; there are still two more to come.
REV.9.13	Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God, 
REV.9.14	responding to the sixth angel, who blew his trumpet, “Set free the four angels who are confined at the great river Euphrates.”
REV.9.15	So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the right hour, day, month, and year, to kill a third of humanity.
REV.9.16	I heard the number of soldiers on horseback—it was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. 
REV.9.17	And in my vision I saw the horses with riders wearing breastplates of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur. The horses had lions’ heads breathing out fire and smoke and sulfur. 
REV.9.18	They killed a third of humanity by these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the lethal power of the horses was in their mouths and their tails, and their tails had snakes’ heads that inflict injuries.
REV.9.20	Those not killed by these plagues did not repent of their deeds so that they would stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—blind and mute idols that have to be carried around. 
REV.9.21	And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their thefts or their immorality.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another extremely powerful angel coming out of heaven, robed in a cloud. There was 
REV.10.2	He held a little opened scroll in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land 
REV.10.3	and gave a tremendous shout, like a lion’s roar. When he shouted, the seven thunders responded, rumbling out 
REV.10.4	I was about to write the messages of the seven thunders, but I heard a heavenly voice say to me:
REV.10.4	Don’t write a word, but place a seal on what the seven thunders have spoken.
REV.10.5	Then the mighty angel whom I saw astride the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven 
REV.10.6	and swore an oath by him who lives for an eternity of eternities, the Creator of heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them:
REV.10.6	No more delay! 
REV.10.7	For in the day when the seventh angel is to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.
REV.10.8	Then the heavenly voice spoke to me again:
REV.10.8	Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.
REV.10.9	I went up to the angel who stood on the sea and the land and told him to give me the little scroll. Then he said to me, “Take it, and eat it. It will be sour in your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth.”
REV.10.10	I took the little scroll from the hand of the mighty angel and ate it. Indeed, it was sweet as honey to taste, but after I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.
REV.10.11	Then they said to me, “You must 
REV.11.1	Then a measuring rod, like a staff, was given to me and I was told:
REV.11.1	Rise and measure God’s temple and the altar and count those who worship in it. 
REV.11.2	But exclude the courtyard outside the temple, for it has been given over to the nations, and for forty-two months they will trample on the holy city. 
REV.11.3	And I will authorize my two witnesses to prophesy, wearing sackcloth for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
REV.11.4	These 
REV.11.5	If anyone attempts to harm them, fire will flow out of their mouths and consume their foes. All who seek to harm them will die in this way. 
REV.11.6	They have authority to shut the heavens so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophesying. They have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague imaginable, as often as they desire.
REV.11.7	When their testimony is completed, the beast that comes up from the sea will wage war against them and conquer them and kill them. 
REV.11.8	Their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city that is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also crucified. 
REV.11.9	For three and a half days people from every ethnicity, tribe, nation, and language will see their corpses, because no one is permitted to bury them. 
REV.11.10	The entire world will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange gifts, because these two prophets had condemned those who dwell on the earth.
REV.11.11	After three and a half days God’s breath of life entered them and they stood to their feet, terrifying all who saw them. 
REV.11.12	Then they heard a loud shout from heaven saying to them:
REV.11.12	Come up here!
REV.11.12	The two prophets climbed up into heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched. 
REV.11.13	At that very moment there was a powerful earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed, killing seven thousand people. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	Now the second woe has passed and the third is coming swiftly.
REV.11.15	Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and a loud voice broke forth in heaven, saying:
REV.11.15	“The kingdom of the world
REV.11.15	has become the kingdom of our God
REV.11.15	and of his Anointed One!
REV.11.15	He will reign supreme for an eternity of eternities!”
REV.11.16	Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell facedown before him and worshiped him, 
REV.11.17	saying:
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
REV.11.17	who is, and who was,
REV.11.17	because you have established
REV.11.17	your great 
REV.11.18	The nations were furious, and you became furious,
REV.11.18	and the time for judging the dead has come.
REV.11.18	The time has come to reward your servants, the prophets
REV.11.18	and the holy ones and all who reverence your name,
REV.11.18	both small and great.
REV.11.18	 to destroy those
REV.11.18	who corrupt the earth!”
REV.11.19	Then God’s temple was opened in heaven and the ark of his covenant was 
REV.12.1	Then an astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven. 
REV.12.2	She was pregnant and was crying out in labor pains, in the agony of giving birth.
REV.12.3	: another astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven! I saw a huge, fiery-red dragon with ten horns and seven heads, each wearing a royal crown. He was wearing seven royal crowns. 
REV.12.4	The dragon’s 
REV.12.5	She gave birth to a man-child who is about to rule and shepherd every nation with an iron scepter, and her son was caught up to God and to his throne. 
REV.12.6	The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had already prepared a 
REV.12.7	Then a terrible war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the great dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back. 
REV.12.8	But the dragon did not have the power to win and they could not regain their place in heaven. 
REV.12.9	So the great dragon was thrown down once and for all. He was the serpent, the ancient snake called the devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole earth. He was cast down into the earth and his angels along with him.
REV.12.10	Then I heard a triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming:
REV.12.10	“Now salvation and power are set in place,
REV.12.10	and the kingdom reign of our God
REV.12.10	and the ruling authority of his Anointed One
REV.12.10	are established.
REV.12.10	For the accuser of our brothers and sisters,
REV.12.10	who 
REV.12.10	day and night before our God,
REV.12.10	has now been 
REV.12.11	They conquered him completely
REV.12.11	through the blood of the Lamb
REV.12.11	and the powerful word of his testimony.
REV.12.11	 they did not love and cling
REV.12.11	to their own lives, even when faced with death.
REV.12.12	So rejoice, you heavens,
REV.12.12	and every heavenly being!
REV.12.12	But woe to the earth and the sea,
REV.12.12	for the devil has come down to you
REV.12.12	with great fury, because he knows
REV.12.12	his time is short.”
REV.12.13	Now, when the dragon realized that he had been cast down to the earth, he set off in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the man-child. 
REV.12.14	But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman so that she could fly and escape into the wilderness to her own special place, where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the dragon.
REV.12.15	Then the dragon spewed from his mouth a 
REV.12.16	But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and at once opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
REV.12.17	Then the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the remnant of her offspring who follow the commands of God and have the testimony of Jesus. 
REV.12.18	And the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore.
REV.13.1	Then I saw a wild beast rising from the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten royal crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names. 
REV.13.2	It was like a leopard with feet like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon shared his power, throne, and great authority with the wild beast.
REV.13.3	One of the heads of the wild beast seemed to have received a deathly wound, but the wound had been healed. After this, the whole world was filled with fascination and followed the wild beast. 
REV.13.4	They worshiped the dragon because he had given the beast its ruling authority. They also worshiped the wild beast, saying, “Who is like the wild beast? And who is able to make war against him?”
REV.13.5	The wild beast was given a mouth to speak boastful and blasphemous words, and he was permitted to exercise authority for forty-two months. 
REV.13.6	So the wild beast began to blaspheme against God, blaspheming his 
REV.13.7	The beast was given the authority to wage war against the holy believers. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation. 
REV.13.8	Everyone on earth will worship the wild beast—those whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb who was slain.
REV.13.9	If anyone has been given ears to hear, he’d better listen! 
REV.13.10	For the one who leads 
REV.13.11	Then I saw another wild beast coming up from the ground. It had two horns like a ram, but it spoke like the dragon. 
REV.13.12	It operated in all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, causing the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed. 
REV.13.13	It performed great miracle-signs, even publicly causing fire to fall out of heaven to the earth. 
REV.13.14	And through these startling miracles that he performed on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the world, telling the people to erect a statue in the image of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived. 
REV.13.15	The beast from the earth was empowered to breathe life into the image of the first beast so that it could speak and kill those who refused to worship its image. 
REV.13.16	It also caused everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and bound, to be marked on the right hand or on the forehead. 
REV.13.17	This meant no one could buy or sell unless they had the mark; that is, the name of the beast or its number.
REV.13.18	This will require wisdom to understand: Let the one with insight interpret the number of the wild beast, for it is humanity’s number—666.
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and behold—there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. Gathered with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a tremendous sound coming out of heaven, like the roar of a waterfall and like the earsplitting sound of a thunderclap. The sound 
REV.14.3	And they were singing a 
REV.14.4	No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed and who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they join themselves to the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from humanity and brought forth as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb. 
REV.14.5	Their words are always true; they are without flaw.
REV.14.6	Then I witnessed another angel flying in the sky, carrying a message of eternal good news to announce to the earth—to every tribe, language, people, and nation. 
REV.14.7	With a loud voice he shouted, “You must reverence God and glorify him, for the time has come for him to judge. Worship at the feet of the Creator of heaven, earth, sea, and springs of water.”
REV.14.8	Then a second angel followed, declaring, “She fell! She fell! Babylon the great is fallen! She once seduced the nations and made them all drink the wine of the passion of her harlotry!”
REV.14.9	Then a third angel followed them, shouting with a mighty voice, “Whoever worships the wild beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	will also drink the wine of God’s wrath. This wine has been poured out and mixed in the cup of his indignation. They will be tormented with sulfur and fire in the presence of holy angels and of the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their severe suffering ascends into ages upon ages. Those who worship the wild beast and its image and receive the mark of its name will have no rest day or night.” 
REV.14.12	This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers—those who follow God’s commands and cling to the faith of Jesus.
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice from the heavenly realm, saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead—the ones dying in the Lord from now on.”
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Holy Spirit, “they will rest from their trouble, for their deeds will live on!”
REV.14.14	I looked and behold—I saw a white cloud, and sitting upon it was one like the Son of Man, wearing a golden crown and holding a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.15	Another angel came out of the temple, shouting out to the one sitting upon the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, for the time of reaping the harvest has come and the harvest of the earth is ripe!” 
REV.14.16	So the one sitting upon the white cloud gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and reaped its harvest.
REV.14.17	Then another angel came out of the heavenly temple, and he too had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar 
REV.14.19	So the angel gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vine of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God. 
REV.14.20	And the winepress was trodden outside the city until blood poured out of the winepress as high as the horse’s bridle for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.
REV.15.1	Then I witnessed another great and astonishing sign in heaven: seven angels bringing the last seven plagues, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
REV.15.2	Then I saw what looked like a vast sea of glass blended with fiery flames. Standing beside the sea were those who continually conquer the wild beast, his image and the number of his name. 
REV.15.3	They each held the harps of God and they were singing the song of Moses, God’s servant, and the song of the Lamb:
REV.15.3	“Mighty and marvelous are your miracles,
REV.15.3	Lord Yahweh, God Almighty!
REV.15.3	Righteous and true are your ways,
REV.15.3	O Sovereign King of the ages!
REV.15.4	Who will not reverence you with awe, O Lord,
REV.15.4	and bring glory to your name?
REV.15.4	For you alone are holy,
REV.15.4	and all nations will come
REV.15.4	and bow in worship before you,
REV.15.4	as your blessings have revealed.”
REV.15.5	After these things I looked, and behold, the inner sanctuary of the heavenly “tabernacle of testimony” was opened before my eyes. 
REV.15.6	The seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the sanctuary in glistening robes of bright linen and golden sashes around their chests.
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a golden bowl full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 
REV.15.8	The sanctuary was filled with the thick cloud of smoke billowing out from the glory and power of God—and no one could even enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from within the sanctuary telling the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”
REV.16.2	So the first angel poured his bowl upon the earth, causing ugly and painful sores to break out on the people who had the mark of the wild beast and worshiped his image.
REV.16.3	Then the second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of the dead—every living thing in the sea died.
REV.16.4	The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say:
REV.16.5	“O holy One, who are and were, you are righteous,
REV.16.5	for you have judged these things,
REV.16.6	because they shed the blood of your saints and prophets.
REV.16.6	They got what they deserved,
REV.16.6	for you gave them blood to drink!”
REV.16.7	Then I heard 
REV.16.7	“Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty!
REV.16.7	Every judicial verdict you make is just and right.”
REV.16.8	Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it began to burn the people with a scorching heat. 
REV.16.9	Though they endured the fierce heat, yet the people continued to blaspheme God. They cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and refused to repent and give him glory.
REV.16.10	The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the wild beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People were in agony and gnawed their tongues 
REV.16.11	and cursed the God of heaven because of their painful sores, refusing to repent of their deeds.
REV.16.12	The sixth angel poured his bowl on “the good and abounding river,” and it completely dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings of the east. 
REV.16.13	Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs belched from the mouths of the dragon, the wild beast, and the false prophet. 
REV.16.14	They were demonic spirits performing signs, and they entered into the kings of the world to draw them into battle on the great day of God, the Almighty.
REV.16.16	The demonic spirits assembled the kings together at the place called in Hebrew the “Mount of the Governor.”
REV.16.17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out from the temple and from the throne, saying:
REV.16.17	“Here it comes!”
REV.16.18	Then there were flashes of lightning, voices, crashes of thunder, and a massive earthquake—the most severe to shake the earth since the creation of man, so tremendous was that earthquake! 
REV.16.19	It split the great city 
REV.16.20	Every island fled away and the mountains were no more. 
REV.16.21	Enormous hailstones, each weighing nearly one hundred pounds, fell from the sky and struck the people, yet they continued to curse God because of the horrendous plague of hail.
REV.17.1	Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls approached me and said, “Come, and I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits 
REV.17.2	The kings of the earth have fornicated with her, and the people of earth are drunk on the wine of her prostitution.”
REV.17.3	Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a wild, bloodred beast with seven heads and ten horns, and it was covered with blasphemous names. 
REV.17.4	The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She was holding in her hand a golden chalice brimming full with defiling obscenities and the filth of her lewdness. 
REV.17.5	On her forehead was written these mysterious titles: “The great Babylon, mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.”
REV.17.6	I saw the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy believers—drunk on the blood of the loyal martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly astonished!
REV.17.7	But the angel said to me, “Why are you so astonished? I will reveal to you the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. 
REV.17.8	The wild beast you saw once was, now is not, and is destined to ascend out of the deep and go to destruction. All those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be utterly astonished when they see the wild beast because he once was, now is not, and is about to rise.
REV.17.9	“This requires a mind that has wisdom to interpret: The seven heads of the beast are seven mountains the woman sits upon; they are also seven kings. 
REV.17.10	Five kings have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come—and when he comes he must remain only a little while. 
REV.17.11	The wild beast that was but now is not represents an eighth king who is from one of the seven, and he is going to destruction.
REV.17.12	“The ten horns that you saw represent ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they and the wild beast are destined to receive authority as kings for 
REV.17.13	They are united in yielding their power and authority to the wild beast. 
REV.17.14	They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings! Those who are with him 
REV.17.15	And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, upon which the great prostitute is seated, represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. 
REV.17.16	The ten horns and the wild beast will hate the great prostitute and will make her a ruin. They will reduce her to nakedness, and they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose for her by agreeing to give their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of God are fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	As for the woman you saw, she is the great city 
REV.18.1	After these things, I saw another angel coming from the heavenly realm with great authority, and the earth was flooded with the brilliance of his splendor. 
REV.18.2	He shouted out with a thunderous voice:
REV.18.2	“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!
REV.18.2	She has become a demonic dwelling place,
REV.18.2	a prison for every unclean spirit, unclean bird,
REV.18.2	and every unclean, detestable beast.
REV.18.3	All the nations have drunk
REV.18.3	of the wine of her immoral passion,
REV.18.3	and the kings of the earth
REV.18.3	have committed fornication with her,
REV.18.3	and merchants of the earth have grown wealthy
REV.18.3	because of her power and luxury.”
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying:
REV.18.4	“My people, come out from her
REV.18.4	so that you don’t participate in her sins
REV.18.4	and have no share with her in her plagues,
REV.18.5	because her sins are heaped as high as heaven
REV.18.5	and God has remembered her vileness.
REV.18.6	So repay to her double the same treatment
REV.18.6	that she has treated others with—
REV.18.6	pay her back double for all her deeds
REV.18.6	and make her drink twice the brew she gave to others!
REV.18.7	With the same measure she exalted herself
REV.18.7	and lived luxuriously,
REV.18.7	give her that measure of torment and grief,
REV.18.7	because she said in her heart,
REV.18.7	‘I am no widow; I rule as a queen!
REV.18.7	I will never experience grief.’
REV.18.8	Therefore, her plagues will fall on her in one day—
REV.18.8	disease, famine and mourning.
REV.18.8	She will be burned with fire.
REV.18.8	For mighty is the Lord God who judges her!”
REV.18.9	The kings of the earth who fornicated with her and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of the fire that burns her up. 
REV.18.10	And they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, saying:
REV.18.10	“Oh no! 
REV.18.10	the great and powerful city Babylon,
REV.18.10	now in one hour your complete devastation has come!”
REV.18.11	The earth’s merchants weep and mourn for her because no one buys their merchandise anymore: 
REV.18.12	their gold, silver, jewels, and pearls, their fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth, all kinds of things made from expensive wood, ivory, bronze, iron, and marble, 
REV.18.13	quantities of the finest cinnamon, spice, incense, frankincense, and myrrh, wine, olive oil, wheat, and the finest flour, sheep, cattle, horses, and their four-wheeled carriages, and the trafficking of the bodies and souls of people. 
REV.18.14	And they will say:
REV.18.14	The splendid delicacies for which your soul craved have departed from you. All your elegance and splendor have disappeared, never to be seen again.
REV.18.15	Those who sold these things and grew wealthy through their business with her will stand far off, terrified over her torment. They will weep and mourn, saying:
REV.18.16	“How horrible!
REV.18.16	The great city that once clothed herself
REV.18.16	with fine linen and purple and scarlet cloth
REV.18.16	glittering with gold, with jewels and with pearls—
REV.18.17	in one brief moment such vast wealth is now laid waste!”
REV.18.17	Every ship’s captain and his crew, every seafarer and mariner, watched from far away 
REV.18.18	and cried out as they saw her go up in flames:
REV.18.18	“What city was ever like the great city 
REV.18.19	, they threw dust on their heads
REV.18.19	and shouted with sobs and grief:
REV.18.19	“How horrible, so horrible, O great city Babylon!
REV.18.19	For in one moment you suffered such destruction—
REV.18.19	you who once made the merchants on the sea
REV.18.19	so very wealthy.
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, O heaven
REV.18.20	You apostles and prophets and holy believers, rejoice!
REV.18.20	For on your behalf
REV.18.20	God pronounced the judgment against her
REV.18.20	that she wanted to bring upon you!
REV.18.21	Then a mighty angel took up a stone, like a huge millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying:
REV.18.21	“With this kind of sudden violence, the great city Babylon
REV.18.21	will be thrown down and exist no more.
REV.18.22	The music of harps, minstrels, flutes, and trumpets
REV.18.22	will never grace your city again.
REV.18.22	No artisan of any trade will ever be found in you again,
REV.18.22	and the noise of factories falls silent.
REV.18.23	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again,
REV.18.23	Nor will the joyous laughter of a wedding be heard in you.
REV.18.23	Your merchants were once the tycoons of the world,
REV.18.23	But you deceived all the nations by your sorcery.
REV.18.24	For the bloodstains of the holy believers and the prophets
REV.18.24	and all who were slaughtered were all over you!”
REV.19.1	After this I heard what seemed to be the roar of a great multitude of voices, saying:
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.1	Salvation and glory and power to our God!
REV.19.2	All his judgments are right and true,
REV.19.2	For he has judged the great prostitute
REV.19.2	who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality.
REV.19.2	He has avenged on her the blood of his 
REV.19.3	And again they shouted:
REV.19.3	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.3	The smoke from her 
REV.19.3	forever and ever!”
REV.19.4	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell facedown and worshiped God, who sits on the throne, saying in 
REV.19.4	“Amen! Hallelujah!”
REV.19.5	Then a voice came from the throne, saying:
REV.19.5	“Praise our God, all you his 
REV.19.5	and all who reverence and honor him—
REV.19.5	those who are lowly and those who are great!”
REV.19.6	Then I heard what seemed to be the thunderous voice of a great multitude, like the sound of a massive waterfall and mighty peals of thunder, crying out:
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.6	For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and exalt him and give him glory,
REV.19.7	because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come.
REV.19.7	And his bride has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	Fine linen, shining bright and clear,
REV.19.8	has been given to her to wear,
REV.19.8	and the fine linen represents
REV.19.8	the righteous deeds of his holy believers.”
REV.19.9	Then the angel said to me, “Write these words: Wonderfully blessed are those who are invited to feast at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” And then he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”
REV.19.10	At this I fell facedown at the angel’s feet to worship him, but he stopped me and said, “Don’t do this! For I am only a fellow servant with you and one of your brothers and sisters who cling to what Jesus testifies. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”
REV.19.11	Then I saw heaven opened, and suddenly a white horse appeared. The name of the one riding it was Faithful and True, and with pure righteousness he judges and rides to battle. 
REV.19.12	He wore many regal crowns, and his eyes were flashing like flames of fire. He had a 
REV.19.13	He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title is called the Word of God. 
REV.19.14	Following him on white horses were the armies of heaven, wearing white fine linen, pure and bright. 
REV.19.15	A sharp sword came from his mouth with which to conquer the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter. He will trample out the wine in the winepress of the wrath of God. 
REV.19.16	On his robe and on his thigh he had inscribed a name: King of kings and Lord of lords.
REV.19.17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to all the flying birds of the sky, “Come and gather for God’s great supper! 
REV.19.18	Come and devour the flesh of the kings, generals, and soldiers, the flesh of horses and their riders, the flesh of all people, slave or free, lowly or famous.”
REV.19.19	Then I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the 
REV.19.20	The wild beast was captured, as was the false prophet who had performed miracle-signs in his presence. (It was by these miracle-signs that he had deceived those with the mark of the wild beast and those who worshiped its image.) The wild beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur, 
REV.19.21	and their armies were killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the 
REV.20.1	Then I saw a 
REV.20.2	He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent known as the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 
REV.20.3	The mighty angel threw him into the pit, locked it, and sealed it so that he could no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were over. (After that he must be loosed for a brief time.)
REV.20.4	Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God. They had refused to worship the wild beast or its image and did not have their foreheads or hands marked by the wild beast. They lived and reigned with the Christ for one thousand years. 
REV.20.5	This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) 
REV.20.6	Wonderfully blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection! The second death holds no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ. And they will reign as kings with him a thousand years!
REV.20.7	After the thousand years are over, Satan will be let loose from his prison 
REV.20.8	and will go out and deceive the nations of the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog. He will bring them together for battle, and they will be as numerous as grains of sand on the seashore.
REV.20.9	They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s holy believers and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and completely destroyed them. 
REV.20.10	Then the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the same place with the wild beast and the false prophet—the lake of fire and sulfur—where they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great, dazzling-white throne and the One who sits on it. Heaven and earth fled from his presence and they were no more. 
REV.20.12	I saw the dead, the lowly and the famous alike, standing before the throne. Books were opened, and then another book was opened: the Book of Life. The dead were judged by what they had done as recorded in the books. 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead 
REV.20.14	Then death and the realm of the dead were cast into the lake of fire, for the lake of fire is the second death. 
REV.20.15	And anyone whose name was not recorded in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	Then 
REV.21.2	I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of the heavenly realm from the presence of God, like a pleasing bride that had been prepared for her husband, 
REV.21.3	And I heard a thunderous voice from the throne, saying:
REV.21.3	“Look! God’s tabernacle is with human beings.
REV.21.3	And from now on he will tabernacle with them as their God.
REV.21.3	Now God himself will have his home with them—
REV.21.3	‘God-with-them’ will be their God!
REV.21.4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
REV.21.4	and eliminate death entirely.
REV.21.4	No one will mourn or weep any longer.
REV.21.4	The pain of wounds will no longer exist,
REV.21.4	for the old order has ceased.”
REV.21.5	And God-Enthroned spoke to me and said, “Consider this! I am making everything to be new and fresh. Write down at once all that I have told you, because each word is trustworthy and dependable.”
REV.21.6	Then he said to me, “It has been accomplished! For I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the end. I will give water to all who are thirsty. As my gracious gift, they will continuously drink from the fountain of living water. 
REV.21.7	The conquering ones will inherit these gifts from me. I will continue to be their God and they will continue being children for me. 
REV.21.8	But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the despicable, the murderers, the perverts, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all deceivers, they will find their place in the lake of fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”
REV.21.9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came to me and said, “Come. I will show you the beautiful bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	He carried me away in 
REV.21.11	It was infused with the glory of God, and its radiance was like that of a very rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
REV.21.12	It had a massive, high wall with twelve gates, and each gate had an angel. Each gate had written upon it a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel—
REV.21.13	three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 
REV.21.14	The city wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	The angel who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates and walls. 
REV.21.16	The city was laid out in a perfect square; its length, width, 
REV.21.17	He also measured the wall at 144 cubits, according to the measure of a man, which is angelic.
REV.21.18	The city was pure gold, clear as crystal, and its wall was made of jasper. 
REV.21.19	The twelve foundations of the wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone—the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
REV.21.20	the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh turquoise, and the twelfth amethyst. 
REV.21.21	The twelve gates are twelve pearls—each gate made of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, clear as crystal.
REV.21.22	I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb.
REV.21.23	The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
REV.21.24	The people will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into it.
REV.21.25	Its gates will never be shut by day—standing always open—because there is no night there.
REV.21.26	People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.
REV.21.27	Evil will not enter, nor anyone who does what is abhorrent or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Book of Life of the Lamb.
REV.22.1	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, flowing with water clear as crystal, continuously pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. 
REV.22.2	The river was flowing in the middle of the street of the city, and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life, with its twelve kinds of 
REV.22.3	And every curse will 
REV.22.3	His loving servants will serve him; 
REV.22.4	they will see constantly his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
REV.22.5	Night will be no more. They will never need the light of the sun or a lamp, because the Lord God will shine on them.
REV.22.5	And they will reign as kings forever and ever!
REV.22.6	Then the angel said to me, “These words are entirely trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his loving servants what must occur swiftly.”
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw it all, I fell facedown to worship the messenger who showed me these things. 
REV.22.9	But he said to me, “Don’t do it! I am but a fellow servant with you and your brothers, the prophets, and with those who cling to the words of this book. Worship God!”
REV.22.10	And he said to me, “Don’t keep secret the prophetic words of this book, for the time is near. 
REV.22.11	Let the evildoers be at their worst and the morally filthy continue in their depravity—yet the righteous will still do what is right, and the holy will still be holy.”
REV.22.14	Wonderfully blessed are those who wash their robes 
REV.22.15	Those 
REV.22.17	 says the Holy Spirit and the Bride 
REV.22.18	I testify to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. 
REV.22.19	And if anyone subtracts from the prophetic words of this book, God will remove his portion from the Tree of Life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
REV.22.20	The one who testifies to these things says, 
REV.22.21	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the holy believers. Amen!
