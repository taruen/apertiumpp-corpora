GEN.1.1	In the 
GEN.1.2	The earth was 
GEN.1.3	Then God said, 
GEN.1.4	And God saw the light, that 
GEN.1.5	God called the light Day, and the 
GEN.1.6	Then God said, 
GEN.1.7	Thus God made the firmament, 
GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
GEN.1.9	Then God said, 
GEN.1.10	And God called the dry 
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the earth 
GEN.1.12	And the earth brought forth grass, the herb 
GEN.1.13	So the evening and the morning were the third day.
GEN.1.14	Then God said, “Let there be 
GEN.1.15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. 
GEN.1.16	Then God made two great lights: the 
GEN.1.17	God set them in the firmament of the 
GEN.1.18	and to 
GEN.1.19	So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.” 
GEN.1.21	So 
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, 
GEN.1.23	So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, 
GEN.1.25	And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that 
GEN.1.26	Then God said, 
GEN.1.27	So God created man 
GEN.1.28	Then God blessed them, and God said to them, 
GEN.1.29	And God said, “See, I have given you every herb 
GEN.1.30	Also, to 
GEN.1.31	Then 
GEN.2.1	Thus the heavens and the earth, and 
GEN.2.2	And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 
GEN.2.3	Then God 
GEN.2.4	This 
GEN.2.5	before any 
GEN.2.6	but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
GEN.2.7	And the 
GEN.2.8	The 
GEN.2.9	And out of the ground the 
GEN.2.10	Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it parted and became four riverheads. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first 
GEN.2.12	And the gold of that land 
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river 
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river 
GEN.2.15	Then the 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil 
GEN.2.18	And the 
GEN.2.19	Out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.
GEN.2.21	And the 
GEN.2.22	Then the rib which the 
GEN.2.23	And Adam said:
GEN.2.23	“This 
GEN.2.23	And flesh of my flesh;
GEN.2.23	She shall be called Woman,
GEN.2.23	Because she was 
GEN.2.24	Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and 
GEN.2.25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not 
GEN.3.1	Now 
GEN.3.2	And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the 
GEN.3.3	but of the fruit of the tree which 
GEN.3.4	Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 
GEN.3.5	For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
GEN.3.6	So when the woman 
GEN.3.7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened, 
GEN.3.8	And they heard 
GEN.3.9	Then the 
GEN.3.10	So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, 
GEN.3.11	And He said, “Who told you that you 
GEN.3.12	Then the man said, 
GEN.3.13	And the 
GEN.3.13	The woman said, 
GEN.3.14	So the 
GEN.3.14	“Because you have done this,
GEN.3.14	You 
GEN.3.14	And more than every beast of the field;
GEN.3.14	On your belly you shall go,
GEN.3.14	And 
GEN.3.14	All the days of your life.
GEN.3.15	And I will put enmity
GEN.3.15	Between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	And between 
GEN.3.15	He shall bruise your head,
GEN.3.15	And you shall bruise His heel.”
GEN.3.16	To the woman He said:
GEN.3.16	“I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception;
GEN.3.16	In pain you shall bring forth children;
GEN.3.16	Your desire 
GEN.3.16	And he shall 
GEN.3.17	Then to Adam He said, 
GEN.3.17	“Cursed 
GEN.3.17	In toil you shall eat 
GEN.3.17	All the days of your life.
GEN.3.18	Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,
GEN.3.18	And 
GEN.3.19	In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread
GEN.3.19	Till you return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	For out of it you were taken;
GEN.3.19	For dust you 
GEN.3.19	And 
GEN.3.20	And Adam called his wife’s name 
GEN.3.21	Also for Adam and his wife the 
GEN.3.22	Then the 
GEN.3.23	therefore the 
GEN.3.24	So 
GEN.4.1	Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I have acquired a man from the 
GEN.4.2	Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now 
GEN.4.3	And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit 
GEN.4.4	Abel also brought of 
GEN.4.5	but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
GEN.4.6	So the 
GEN.4.7	If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire 
GEN.4.8	Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and 
GEN.4.9	Then the 
GEN.4.9	He said, 
GEN.4.10	And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood 
GEN.4.11	So now 
GEN.4.12	When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.”
GEN.4.13	And Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; 
GEN.4.15	And the 
GEN.4.16	Then Cain 
GEN.4.17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Ē´noch. And he built a city, 
GEN.4.18	To Ē´noch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.
GEN.4.19	Then Lamech took for himself 
GEN.4.20	And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 
GEN.4.21	His brother’s name 
GEN.4.22	And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain 
GEN.4.23	Then Lamech said to his wives:
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
GEN.4.23	Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech!
GEN.4.23	For I have killed a man for wounding me,
GEN.4.23	Even a young man for hurting me.
GEN.4.24	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
GEN.4.24	Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and 
GEN.4.26	And as for Seth, 
GEN.5.1	This is the book of the 
GEN.5.2	He created them 
GEN.5.3	And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot 
GEN.5.4	After he begot Seth, 
GEN.5.5	So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; 
GEN.5.6	Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	After he begot 
GEN.5.8	So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
GEN.5.9	Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan. 
GEN.5.10	After he begot Cainan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and had sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
GEN.5.12	Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	So all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
GEN.5.15	Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared. 
GEN.5.16	After he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.
GEN.5.18	Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot 
GEN.5.19	After he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.
GEN.5.21	Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After he begot Methuselah, Enoch 
GEN.5.23	So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 
GEN.5.24	And 
GEN.5.25	Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
GEN.5.28	Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and had a son. 
GEN.5.29	And he called his name 
GEN.5.30	After he begot Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and had sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.
GEN.5.32	And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot 
GEN.6.1	Now it came to pass, 
GEN.6.2	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they 
GEN.6.3	And the 
GEN.6.4	There were giants on the earth in those 
GEN.6.5	Then the 
GEN.6.6	And 
GEN.6.7	So the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah 
GEN.6.9	This is the genealogy of Noah. 
GEN.6.10	And Noah begot three sons: 
GEN.6.11	The earth also was corrupt 
GEN.6.12	So God 
GEN.6.13	And God said to Noah, 
GEN.6.14	Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch. 
GEN.6.15	And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark 
GEN.6.16	You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it 
GEN.6.17	And behold, I Myself am bringing 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish My 
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring 
GEN.6.20	Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every 
GEN.6.21	And you shall take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather 
GEN.6.22	Thus Noah did; 
GEN.7.1	Then the 
GEN.7.2	You shall take with you seven each of every 
GEN.7.3	also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep the species alive on the face of all the earth. 
GEN.7.4	For after 
GEN.7.5	And Noah did according to all that the 
GEN.7.6	Noah 
GEN.7.7	So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Of clean animals, of animals that 
GEN.7.9	two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth. 
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on 
GEN.7.12	And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	On the very same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark— 
GEN.7.14	they and every beast after its kind, all cattle after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every 
GEN.7.15	And they 
GEN.7.16	So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in 
GEN.7.17	Now the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	The waters prevailed and greatly increased on the earth, 
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered. 
GEN.7.20	The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. 
GEN.7.21	And all flesh died that moved on the earth: birds and cattle and beasts and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. 
GEN.7.22	All in 
GEN.7.23	So He destroyed all living things which were on the face of the ground: both man and cattle, creeping thing and bird of the air. They were destroyed from the earth. Only 
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed on the earth one hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	Then God 
GEN.8.2	The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were also 
GEN.8.3	And the waters receded continually from the earth. At the end 
GEN.8.4	Then the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth 
GEN.8.6	So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah 
GEN.8.7	Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters 
GEN.8.10	And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark. 
GEN.8.11	Then the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf 
GEN.8.12	So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.
GEN.8.13	And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first 
GEN.8.14	And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.
GEN.8.15	Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	“Go out of the ark, 
GEN.8.17	Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that 
GEN.8.18	So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him. 
GEN.8.19	Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, 
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an 
GEN.8.21	And the 
GEN.8.22	“While the earth 
GEN.8.22	Seedtime and harvest,
GEN.8.22	Cold and heat,
GEN.8.22	Winter and summer,
GEN.8.22	And 
GEN.8.22	Shall not cease.”
GEN.9.1	So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: 
GEN.9.2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you 
GEN.9.4	But you shall not eat flesh with its life, 
GEN.9.5	Surely for your lifeblood I will demand 
GEN.9.6	“Whoever 
GEN.9.6	By man his blood shall be shed;
GEN.9.6	For in the image of God
GEN.9.6	He made man.
GEN.9.7	And as for you, 
GEN.9.7	Bring forth abundantly in the earth
GEN.9.7	And multiply in it.”
GEN.9.8	Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying: 
GEN.9.9	“And as for Me, 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that 
GEN.9.11	Thus 
GEN.9.12	And God said: 
GEN.9.13	I set 
GEN.9.14	It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; 
GEN.9.15	and 
GEN.9.16	The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember 
GEN.9.17	And God said to Noah, “This 
GEN.9.18	Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
GEN.9.19	These three 
GEN.9.20	And Noah began 
GEN.9.21	Then he drank of the wine 
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid 
GEN.9.24	So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him. 
GEN.9.25	Then he said:
GEN.9.25	“Cursed 
GEN.9.25	A 
GEN.9.25	He shall be to his brethren.”
GEN.9.26	And he said:
GEN.9.26	“Blessed 
GEN.9.26	The God of Shem,
GEN.9.26	And may Canaan be his servant.
GEN.9.27	May God 
GEN.9.27	And may he dwell in the tents of Shem;
GEN.9.27	And may Canaan be his servant.”
GEN.9.28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
GEN.9.29	So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
GEN.10.1	Now this 
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth 
GEN.10.3	The sons of Gomer 
GEN.10.4	The sons of Javan 
GEN.10.5	From these 
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham 
GEN.10.7	The sons of Cush 
GEN.10.8	Cush begot 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty 
GEN.10.10	And the beginning of his kingdom was 
GEN.10.11	From that land he went to 
GEN.10.12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that 
GEN.10.13	Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusim, and Casluhim 
GEN.10.15	Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and 
GEN.10.16	the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 
GEN.10.17	the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite; 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed. 
GEN.10.19	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These 
GEN.10.21	And 
GEN.10.22	The 
GEN.10.23	The sons of Aram 
GEN.10.24	Arphaxad begot 
GEN.10.25	To Eber were born two sons: the name of one 
GEN.10.26	Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these 
GEN.10.30	And their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These 
GEN.10.32	These 
GEN.11.1	Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. 
GEN.11.2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land 
GEN.11.3	Then they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake 
GEN.11.4	And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower 
GEN.11.5	But the 
GEN.11.6	And the 
GEN.11.7	Come, 
GEN.11.8	So 
GEN.11.9	Therefore its name is called Babel, 
GEN.11.10	This 
GEN.11.11	After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, 
GEN.11.13	After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. 
GEN.11.15	After he begot Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot 
GEN.11.17	After he begot Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. 
GEN.11.19	After he begot Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot 
GEN.11.21	After he begot Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot 
GEN.11.25	After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	Now Terah lived seventy years, and 
GEN.11.27	This 
GEN.11.28	And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
GEN.11.29	Then Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife 
GEN.11.30	But
GEN.11.31	And Terah 
GEN.11.32	So the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Now the 
GEN.12.1	“Get 
GEN.12.1	From your family
GEN.12.1	And from your father’s house,
GEN.12.1	To a land that I will show you.
GEN.12.2	I will make you a great nation;
GEN.12.2	I will bless you
GEN.12.2	And make your name great;
GEN.12.2	And you shall be a blessing.
GEN.12.3	I will bless those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	And I will curse him who curses you;
GEN.12.3	And in 
GEN.12.4	So Abram departed as the 
GEN.12.5	Then Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and 
GEN.12.6	Abram 
GEN.12.7	Then the 
GEN.12.8	And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent 
GEN.12.9	So Abram journeyed, 
GEN.12.10	Now there was 
GEN.12.11	And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “Indeed I know that you 
GEN.12.12	Therefore it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This 
GEN.12.13	Please say you 
GEN.12.14	So it was, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she 
GEN.12.15	The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.12.16	He 
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	And Pharaoh called Abram and said, 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She 
GEN.12.20	So Pharaoh commanded 
GEN.13.1	Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and 
GEN.13.2	Abram 
GEN.13.3	And he went on his journey 
GEN.13.4	to the 
GEN.13.5	Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. 
GEN.13.6	Now 
GEN.13.7	And there was 
GEN.13.8	So Abram said to Lot, 
GEN.13.9	 not the whole land before you? Please 
GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all 
GEN.13.11	Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated from each other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot 
GEN.13.13	But the men of Sodom 
GEN.13.14	And the 
GEN.13.15	for all the land which you see 
GEN.13.16	And 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.”
GEN.13.18	Then Abram moved 
GEN.14.1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king 
GEN.14.2	 they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of 
GEN.14.3	All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (that 
GEN.14.8	And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that 
GEN.14.9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the Valley of Siddim 
GEN.14.11	Then they took 
GEN.14.12	They also took Lot, Abram’s 
GEN.14.13	Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the 
GEN.14.14	Now 
GEN.14.15	He divided his forces against them by night, and he and his servants 
GEN.14.16	So he 
GEN.14.17	And the king of Sodom 
GEN.14.18	Then 
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him and said:
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Possessor of heaven and earth;
GEN.14.20	And 
GEN.14.20	Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”
GEN.14.20	And he 
GEN.14.21	Now the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the goods for yourself.”
GEN.14.22	But Abram 
GEN.14.23	that 
GEN.14.24	except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.”
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	But Abram said, “Lord 
GEN.15.3	Then Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed 
GEN.15.4	And behold, the word of the 
GEN.15.5	Then He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and 
GEN.15.6	And he 
GEN.15.7	Then He said to him, “I 
GEN.15.8	And he said, “Lord 
GEN.15.9	So He said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	Then he brought all these to Him and 
GEN.15.11	And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	Now when the sun was going down, 
GEN.15.13	Then He said to Abram: “Know certainly 
GEN.15.14	And also the nation whom they serve 
GEN.15.15	Now as for you, 
GEN.15.16	But 
GEN.15.17	And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that 
GEN.15.18	On the same day the 
GEN.15.18	“To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates— 
GEN.15.19	the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, 
GEN.16.2	So Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the 
GEN.16.3	Then Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram 
GEN.16.4	So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became 
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong 
GEN.16.6	So Abram said to Sarai, “Indeed your maid 
GEN.16.7	Now the 
GEN.16.8	And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from, and where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”
GEN.16.9	The Angel of the 
GEN.16.10	Then the Angel of the 
GEN.16.11	And the Angel of the 
GEN.16.11	“Behold, you 
GEN.16.11	And you shall bear a son.
GEN.16.11	You shall call his name Ishmael,
GEN.16.11	Because the 
GEN.16.12	He shall be a wild man;
GEN.16.12	His hand 
GEN.16.12	And every man’s hand against him.
GEN.16.12	And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.”
GEN.16.13	Then she called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called 
GEN.16.15	So 
GEN.16.16	Abram 
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	And I will make My 
GEN.17.3	Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: 
GEN.17.4	“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a 
GEN.17.5	No longer shall 
GEN.17.6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations 
GEN.17.7	And I will 
GEN.17.8	Also 
GEN.17.9	And God said to Abraham: “As for you, 
GEN.17.10	This 
GEN.17.11	and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be 
GEN.17.12	He who is eight days old among you 
GEN.17.13	He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person 
GEN.17.15	Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah 
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell on his face 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham 
GEN.17.19	Then God said: “No, 
GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and 
GEN.17.21	But My 
GEN.17.22	Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
GEN.17.23	So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son 
GEN.17.26	That very same day Abraham was circumcised, and his son Ishmael; 
GEN.17.27	and 
GEN.18.1	Then the 
GEN.18.2	So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; 
GEN.18.3	and said, “My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant. 
GEN.18.4	Please let 
GEN.18.5	And 
GEN.18.5	They said, “Do as you have said.”
GEN.18.6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead 
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave 
GEN.18.8	So 
GEN.18.9	Then they said to him, “Where 
GEN.18.9	So he said, “Here, 
GEN.18.10	And He said, “I will certainly return to you 
GEN.18.10	(Sarah was listening in the tent door which 
GEN.18.11	Now 
GEN.18.12	Therefore Sarah 
GEN.18.13	And the 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	But Sarah denied 
GEN.18.15	And He said, “No, but you did laugh!”
GEN.18.16	Then the men rose from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them 
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be 
GEN.18.19	For I have known him, in order 
GEN.18.20	And the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, 
GEN.18.22	Then the men turned away from there 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham 
GEN.18.24	Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare 
GEN.18.25	Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that 
GEN.18.26	So the 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham answered and said, “Indeed now, I who 
GEN.18.28	Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for 
GEN.18.28	So He said, “If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy 
GEN.18.29	And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose there should be forty found there?”
GEN.18.29	So He said, “I will not do 
GEN.18.30	Then he said, 
GEN.18.30	So He said, “I will not do 
GEN.18.31	And he said, “Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there?”
GEN.18.31	So He said, “I will not destroy 
GEN.18.32	Then he said, “Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there?”
GEN.18.32	And He said, “I will not destroy 
GEN.18.33	So the 
GEN.19.1	Now 
GEN.19.2	And he said, “Here now, my lords, please 
GEN.19.2	And they said, 
GEN.19.3	But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. 
GEN.19.4	Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. 
GEN.19.5	And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? 
GEN.19.6	So 
GEN.19.7	and said, “Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly! 
GEN.19.8	See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these men, 
GEN.19.9	And they said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one 
GEN.19.10	But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	And they 
GEN.19.12	Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city—
GEN.19.13	For we will destroy this place, because the 
GEN.19.14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, 
GEN.19.15	When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry, saying, 
GEN.19.16	And while he lingered, the men 
GEN.19.17	So it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that he said, 
GEN.19.18	Then Lot said to them, “Please, 
GEN.19.19	Indeed now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die. 
GEN.19.20	See now, this city 
GEN.19.21	And he said to him, “See, 
GEN.19.22	Hurry, escape there. For 
GEN.19.22	Therefore 
GEN.19.23	The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	So He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and 
GEN.19.26	But his wife looked back behind him, and she became 
GEN.19.27	And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where 
GEN.19.28	Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, 
GEN.19.29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God 
GEN.19.30	Then Lot went up out of Zoar and 
GEN.19.31	Now the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father 
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we 
GEN.19.33	So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
GEN.19.34	It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, “Indeed I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in 
GEN.19.35	Then they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
GEN.19.36	Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; 
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; 
GEN.20.1	And Abraham journeyed from 
GEN.20.2	Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife, 
GEN.20.3	But 
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, 
GEN.20.5	Did he not say to me, ‘She 
GEN.20.6	And God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For 
GEN.20.7	Now therefore, restore the man’s wife; 
GEN.20.8	So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid. 
GEN.20.9	And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I offended you, 
GEN.20.10	Then Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you have in view, that you have done this thing?”
GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely 
GEN.20.12	But indeed 
GEN.20.13	And it came to pass, when 
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech 
GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, “See, 
GEN.20.16	Then to Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand 
GEN.20.17	So Abraham prayed 
GEN.20.18	for the 
GEN.21.1	And the 
GEN.21.2	For Sarah 
GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore to him—
GEN.21.4	Then Abraham 
GEN.21.5	Now 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, 
GEN.21.7	She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? 
GEN.21.8	So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.
GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar 
GEN.21.10	Therefore she said to Abraham, 
GEN.21.11	And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s sight 
GEN.21.12	But God said to Abraham, “Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because of the lad or because of your bondwoman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for 
GEN.21.13	Yet I will also make 
GEN.21.14	So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting 
GEN.21.15	And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went and sat down across from 
GEN.21.17	And 
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for 
GEN.21.19	Then 
GEN.21.20	So God 
GEN.21.21	He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother 
GEN.21.22	And it came to pass at that time that 
GEN.21.23	Now therefore, 
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s servants 
GEN.21.26	And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard 
GEN.21.27	So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them 
GEN.21.28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
GEN.21.29	Then Abimelech asked Abraham, 
GEN.21.30	And he said, “You will take 
GEN.21.31	Therefore he 
GEN.21.32	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. So Abimelech rose with Phichol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Then 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.
GEN.22.1	Now it came to pass after these things that 
GEN.22.1	And he said, “Here I am.”
GEN.22.2	Then He said, “Take now your son, 
GEN.22.3	So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. 
GEN.22.5	And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will 
GEN.22.6	So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and 
GEN.22.7	But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!”
GEN.22.7	And he said, “Here I am, my son.”
GEN.22.7	Then he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where 
GEN.22.8	And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the 
GEN.22.9	Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and 
GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
GEN.22.11	But the 
GEN.22.11	So he said, “Here I am.”
GEN.22.12	And He said, 
GEN.22.13	Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind 
GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of the place, The-
GEN.22.15	Then the Angel of the 
GEN.22.16	and said: 
GEN.22.17	blessing I will 
GEN.22.18	In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, 
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to 
GEN.22.20	Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, “Indeed 
GEN.22.21	Huz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father 
GEN.22.22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	And 
GEN.22.24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; 
GEN.23.2	So Sarah died in 
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of 
GEN.23.4	“I 
GEN.23.5	And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.6	“Hear us, my lord: You 
GEN.23.7	Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. 
GEN.23.8	And he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your wish that I bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, 
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of 
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth, all who 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that 
GEN.23.12	Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land; 
GEN.23.13	and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If you 
GEN.23.14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me; the land 
GEN.23.16	And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham 
GEN.23.17	So 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
GEN.23.19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (that 
GEN.23.20	So the field and the cave that 
GEN.24.1	Now Abraham 
GEN.24.2	So Abraham said 
GEN.24.3	and I will make you 
GEN.24.4	but you shall go 
GEN.24.5	And the servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?”
GEN.24.6	But Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, 
GEN.24.11	And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time 
GEN.24.12	Then he 
GEN.24.13	Behold, 
GEN.24.14	Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your pitcher that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink’—
GEN.24.15	And it happened, 
GEN.24.16	Now the young woman 
GEN.24.17	And the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.”
GEN.24.18	So she said, “Drink, my lord.” Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw 
GEN.24.20	Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw 
GEN.24.21	And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether 
GEN.24.22	So it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden 
GEN.24.23	and said, “Whose daughter 
GEN.24.24	So she said to him, 
GEN.24.25	Moreover she said to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.”
GEN.24.26	Then the man 
GEN.24.27	And he said, 
GEN.24.28	So the young woman ran and told her mother’s household these things.
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother whose name 
GEN.24.30	So it came to pass, when he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, “Thus the man spoke to me,” that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well. 
GEN.24.31	And he said, “Come in, 
GEN.24.32	Then the man came to the house. And he unloaded the camels, and 
GEN.24.33	 was set before him to eat, but he said, 
GEN.24.33	And he said, “Speak on.”
GEN.24.34	So he said, “I 
GEN.24.35	The 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah my master’s wife 
GEN.24.37	Now my master 
GEN.24.38	but you shall go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’ 
GEN.24.40	But he said to me, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family; for if they will not give 
GEN.24.42	“And this day I came to the well and said, 
GEN.24.43	behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw 
GEN.24.44	and she says to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,”—
GEN.24.45	“But before I had finished 
GEN.24.46	And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her 
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter 
GEN.24.48	And I bowed my head and worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	Now if you will 
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, 
GEN.24.51	Here 
GEN.24.52	And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that 
GEN.24.53	Then the servant brought out 
GEN.24.54	And he and the men who 
GEN.24.55	But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us 
GEN.24.56	And he said to them, “Do not hinder me, since the 
GEN.24.57	So they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her personally.” 
GEN.24.58	Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”
GEN.24.58	And she said, “I will go.”
GEN.24.59	So they sent away Rebekah their sister 
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her:
GEN.24.60	“Our sister, 
GEN.24.60	 And may your descendants possess
GEN.24.60	The gates of those who hate them.”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac came from the way of 
GEN.24.63	And Isaac went out 
GEN.24.64	Then Rebekah lifted her eyes, and when 
GEN.24.65	for she had said to the servant, “Who 
GEN.24.65	The servant said, “It 
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent; and he 
GEN.25.1	Abraham again took a wife, and her name 
GEN.25.2	And 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Midian 
GEN.25.5	And 
GEN.25.6	But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he 
GEN.25.7	This 
GEN.25.8	Then Abraham breathed his last and 
GEN.25.9	And 
GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. 
GEN.25.11	And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at 
GEN.25.12	Now this 
GEN.25.13	And 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These 
GEN.25.17	These 
GEN.25.18	(They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which 
GEN.25.19	This 
GEN.25.20	Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, 
GEN.25.21	Now Isaac pleaded with the 
GEN.25.22	But the children struggled together within her; and she said, “If 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.23	“Two nations 
GEN.25.23	Two peoples shall be separated from your body;
GEN.25.23	 people shall be stronger than 
GEN.25.23	And the older shall serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	So when her days were fulfilled 
GEN.25.25	And the first came out red. 
GEN.25.26	Afterward his brother came out, and 
GEN.25.27	So the boys grew. And Esau was 
GEN.25.28	And Isaac loved Esau because he 
GEN.25.29	Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he 
GEN.25.30	And Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red 
GEN.25.31	But Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright as of this day.”
GEN.25.32	And Esau said, “Look, I 
GEN.25.33	Then Jacob said, “Swear to me as of this day.”
GEN.25.33	So he swore to him, and 
GEN.25.34	And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then 
GEN.26.1	There was a famine in the land, besides 
GEN.26.2	Then the 
GEN.26.3	Dwell in this land, and 
GEN.26.4	And 
GEN.26.5	because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”
GEN.26.6	So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	And the men of the place asked about his wife. And 
GEN.26.8	Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac, showing endearment to Rebekah his wife. 
GEN.26.9	Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Quite obviously she 
GEN.26.9	Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die on account of her.’ ”
GEN.26.10	And Abimelech said, “What 
GEN.26.11	So Abimelech charged all 
GEN.26.12	Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year 
GEN.26.13	The man 
GEN.26.14	for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines 
GEN.26.15	Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells 
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for 
GEN.26.17	Then Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
GEN.26.18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. 
GEN.26.19	Also Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there. 
GEN.26.20	But the herdsmen of Gerar 
GEN.26.21	Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that 
GEN.26.22	And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, “For now the 
GEN.26.23	Then he went up from there to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	So he 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, 
GEN.26.27	And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, 
GEN.26.28	But they said, “We have certainly seen that the 
GEN.26.29	that you will do us no harm, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace. 
GEN.26.30	So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Then they arose early in the morning and 
GEN.26.32	It came to pass the same day that Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” 
GEN.26.33	So he called it Shebah. 
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	And 
GEN.27.1	Now it came to pass, when Isaac was 
GEN.27.1	And he answered him, “Here I am.”
GEN.27.2	Then he said, “Behold now, I am old. I 
GEN.27.3	Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me. 
GEN.27.4	And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring 
GEN.27.5	Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring 
GEN.27.6	So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Indeed I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of the 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make 
GEN.27.10	Then you shall take 
GEN.27.11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Look, 
GEN.27.12	Perhaps my father will 
GEN.27.13	But his mother said to him, 
GEN.27.14	And he went and got 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took the 
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	Then she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	So he went to his father and said, “My father.”
GEN.27.18	And he said, “Here I am. Who 
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to his father, “I 
GEN.27.20	But Isaac said to his son, “How 
GEN.27.20	And he said, “Because the 
GEN.27.21	Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I 
GEN.27.22	So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice 
GEN.27.23	And he did not recognize him, because 
GEN.27.24	Then he said, “
GEN.27.24	He said, “I 
GEN.27.25	He said, “Bring 
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	And he came near and 
GEN.27.27	“Surely, 
GEN.27.27	 like the smell of a field
GEN.27.27	Which the 
GEN.27.28	Therefore may 
GEN.27.28	Of 
GEN.27.28	Of 
GEN.27.28	And 
GEN.27.29	Let peoples serve you,
GEN.27.29	And nations bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Be master over your brethren,
GEN.27.29	And 
GEN.27.29	Cursed 
GEN.27.29	And blessed 
GEN.27.30	Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, “Let my father arise and 
GEN.27.32	And his father Isaac said to him, “Who 
GEN.27.32	So he said, “I 
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, “Who? Where 
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, 
GEN.27.35	But he said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	And 
GEN.27.37	Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, 
GEN.27.38	And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me—me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice 
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:
GEN.27.39	“Behold, 
GEN.27.39	And of the dew of heaven from above.
GEN.27.40	By your sword you shall live,
GEN.27.40	And 
GEN.27.40	And 
GEN.27.40	That you shall break his yoke from your neck.”
GEN.27.41	So Esau 
GEN.27.42	And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Surely your brother Esau 
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban 
GEN.27.44	And stay with him a 
GEN.27.45	until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?”
GEN.27.46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, 
GEN.28.1	Then Isaac called Jacob and 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to 
GEN.28.3	“May 
GEN.28.3	And make you 
GEN.28.3	That you may be an assembly of peoples;
GEN.28.4	And give you 
GEN.28.4	To you and your descendants with you,
GEN.28.4	That you may inherit the land
GEN.28.4	In which you are a stranger,
GEN.28.4	Which God gave to Abraham.”
GEN.28.5	So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there, 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan Aram. 
GEN.28.8	Also Esau saw 
GEN.28.9	So Esau went to Ishmael and 
GEN.28.10	Now Jacob 
GEN.28.11	So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	Then he 
GEN.28.13	And behold, the 
GEN.28.14	Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad 
GEN.28.15	Behold, 
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid and said, “How awesome 
GEN.28.18	Then Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, 
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of 
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If 
GEN.28.21	so that 
GEN.28.22	And this stone which I have set as a pillar 
GEN.29.1	So Jacob went on his journey 
GEN.29.2	And he looked, and saw a 
GEN.29.3	Now all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well’s mouth.
GEN.29.4	And Jacob said to them, “My brethren, where 
GEN.29.4	And they said, “We 
GEN.29.5	Then he said to them, “Do you know 
GEN.29.5	And they said, “We know him.”
GEN.29.6	So he said to them, 
GEN.29.6	And they said, “
GEN.29.7	Then he said, “Look, 
GEN.29.8	But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	Now while he was still speaking with them, 
GEN.29.10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob 
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he 
GEN.29.13	Then it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister’s son, that 
GEN.29.14	And Laban said to him, 
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you 
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder 
GEN.29.17	Leah’s eyes 
GEN.29.18	Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, 
GEN.29.19	And Laban said, “
GEN.29.20	So Jacob 
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give 
GEN.29.22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and 
GEN.29.23	Now it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. 
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave his maid 
GEN.29.25	So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it 
GEN.29.26	And Laban said, “It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
GEN.29.27	Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years.”
GEN.29.28	Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also. 
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave his maid 
GEN.29.30	Then 
GEN.29.31	When the 
GEN.29.32	So Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, “The 
GEN.29.33	Then she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the 
GEN.29.34	She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. 
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	Now when Rachel saw that 
GEN.30.2	And Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, 
GEN.30.3	So she said, “Here is 
GEN.30.4	Then she gave him Bilhah her maid 
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Then Rachel said, “God has 
GEN.30.7	And Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Then Rachel said, “With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, 
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and 
GEN.30.10	And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	Then Leah said, “A troop comes!” So she called his name Gad. 
GEN.30.12	And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	Then Leah said, “I am happy, for the daughters 
GEN.30.14	Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, 
GEN.30.15	But she said to her, 
GEN.30.15	And Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” And he lay with her that night.
GEN.30.17	And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Leah said, “God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband.” So she called his name Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	And Leah said, “God has endowed me 
GEN.30.21	Afterward she bore a 
GEN.30.22	Then God 
GEN.30.23	And she conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away 
GEN.30.24	So she called his name Joseph, and said, 
GEN.30.25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, 
GEN.30.26	Give 
GEN.30.27	And Laban said to him, “Please 
GEN.30.28	Then he said, 
GEN.30.29	So 
GEN.30.30	For what you had before I 
GEN.30.31	So he said, “What shall I give you?”
GEN.30.31	And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flocks: 
GEN.30.32	Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and 
GEN.30.33	So my 
GEN.30.34	And Laban said, “Oh, that it were according to your word!” 
GEN.30.35	So he removed that day the male goats that were 
GEN.30.36	Then he put three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
GEN.30.37	Now 
GEN.30.38	And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban’s flock.
GEN.30.41	And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 
GEN.30.42	But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put 
GEN.30.43	Thus the man 
GEN.31.1	Now 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob saw the 
GEN.31.3	Then the 
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock, 
GEN.31.5	and said to them, 
GEN.31.6	And 
GEN.31.7	Yet your father has deceived me and 
GEN.31.8	If he said thus: ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: 
GEN.31.9	So God has 
GEN.31.10	“And it happened, at the time when the flocks conceived, that I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks 
GEN.31.11	Then 
GEN.31.12	And He said, ‘Lift your eyes now and see, all the rams which leap on the flocks 
GEN.31.13	I 
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, 
GEN.31.15	Are we not considered strangers by him? For 
GEN.31.16	For all these riches which God has taken from our father are 
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob rose and set his sons and his wives on camels. 
GEN.31.18	And he carried away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Padan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of 
GEN.31.19	Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee. 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and 
GEN.31.22	And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	Then he took 
GEN.31.24	But God 
GEN.31.25	So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead.
GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Jacob: “What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and 
GEN.31.27	Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp? 
GEN.31.28	And you did not allow me 
GEN.31.29	It is in my power to do you harm, but the 
GEN.31.30	And now you have surely gone because you greatly long for your father’s house, 
GEN.31.31	Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was 
GEN.31.32	With whomever you find your gods, 
GEN.31.33	And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the two maids’ tents, but he did not find 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. And Laban searched all about the tent but did not find 
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, “Let it not displease my lord that I cannot 
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob was angry and rebuked Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: “What 
GEN.31.37	Although you have searched all my things, what part of your household things have you found? Set 
GEN.31.38	These twenty years I 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn 
GEN.31.40	 I was! In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I 
GEN.31.42	Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and 
GEN.31.43	And Laban answered and said to Jacob, “
GEN.31.44	Now therefore, come, 
GEN.31.45	So Jacob 
GEN.31.46	Then Jacob said to his brethren, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap. 
GEN.31.47	Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 
GEN.31.48	And Laban said, 
GEN.31.49	also 
GEN.31.50	If you afflict my daughters, or if you take 
GEN.31.51	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Here is this heap and here is 
GEN.31.52	This heap 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father 
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	And early in the morning Laban arose, and 
GEN.32.1	So Jacob went on his way, and 
GEN.32.2	When Jacob saw them, he said, “This 
GEN.32.3	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother 
GEN.32.4	And he commanded them, saying, 
GEN.32.5	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that 
GEN.32.6	Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and 
GEN.32.7	So Jacob was greatly afraid and 
GEN.32.8	And he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the other company which is left will escape.”
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob said, 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the 
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and attack me 
GEN.32.12	For 
GEN.32.13	So he lodged there that same night, and took what came to his hand as 
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. 
GEN.32.16	Then he delivered 
GEN.32.17	And he commanded the first one, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose 
GEN.32.18	then you shall say, ‘They 
GEN.32.19	So he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, “In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him; 
GEN.32.20	and also say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob 
GEN.32.21	So the present went on over before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, 
GEN.32.23	He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had. 
GEN.32.24	Then Jacob was left alone; and 
GEN.32.25	Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and 
GEN.32.26	And 
GEN.32.26	But he said, 
GEN.32.27	So He said to him, “What 
GEN.32.27	He said, “Jacob.”
GEN.32.28	And He said, 
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked, saying, “Tell 
GEN.32.29	And He said, 
GEN.32.30	So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: “For 
GEN.32.31	Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he limped on his hip. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle that shrank, which 
GEN.33.1	Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there, 
GEN.33.2	And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	Then he crossed over before them and 
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, 
GEN.33.5	And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, “Who 
GEN.33.5	So he said, “The children 
GEN.33.6	Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.
GEN.33.8	Then Esau said, “What 
GEN.33.8	And he said, “
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”
GEN.33.10	And Jacob said, “No, please, if I 
GEN.33.11	Please, take 
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.”
GEN.33.13	But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children 
GEN.33.14	Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on slowly at a pace which the livestock that go before me, and the children, are able to endure, until I come to my lord 
GEN.33.15	And Esau said, “Now let me leave with you 
GEN.33.15	But he said, “What need is there? 
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	And Jacob journeyed to 
GEN.33.18	Then Jacob came safely to 
GEN.33.19	And 
GEN.33.20	Then he erected an altar there and called it 
GEN.34.1	Now 
GEN.34.2	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he 
GEN.34.3	His soul was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke kindly to the young woman. 
GEN.34.4	So Shechem 
GEN.34.5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob 
GEN.34.6	Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. 
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard 
GEN.34.8	But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. 
GEN.34.9	And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	So you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions for yourselves in it.”
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. 
GEN.34.12	Ask me ever so much 
GEN.34.13	But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke 
GEN.34.14	And they said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is 
GEN.34.15	But on this 
GEN.34.16	then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.”
GEN.34.18	And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. 
GEN.34.19	So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. He 
GEN.34.20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the 
GEN.34.21	“These men 
GEN.34.22	Only on this 
GEN.34.23	 not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs 
GEN.34.24	And all who 
GEN.34.25	Now it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, 
GEN.34.26	And they 
GEN.34.27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled. 
GEN.34.28	They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what 
GEN.34.29	and all their wealth. All their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that 
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 
GEN.34.31	But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a harlot?”
GEN.35.1	Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to 
GEN.35.2	And Jacob said to his 
GEN.35.3	Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, 
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which 
GEN.35.5	And they journeyed, and 
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to 
GEN.35.7	And he 
GEN.35.8	Now 
GEN.35.9	Then 
GEN.35.10	And God said to him, “Your name 
GEN.35.11	Also God said to him: 
GEN.35.12	The 
GEN.35.13	Then God 
GEN.35.14	So Jacob 
GEN.35.15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, 
GEN.35.16	Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored 
GEN.35.17	Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, “Do not fear; 
GEN.35.18	And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin. 
GEN.35.19	So 
GEN.35.20	And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which 
GEN.35.21	Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond 
GEN.35.22	And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and 
GEN.35.22	Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
GEN.35.23	the sons of Leah 
GEN.35.24	the sons of Rachel 
GEN.35.25	the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, 
GEN.35.26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, 
GEN.35.27	Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at 
GEN.35.28	Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	So Isaac breathed his last and died, and 
GEN.36.1	Now this 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the 
GEN.36.3	and 
GEN.36.4	Now 
GEN.36.5	And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These 
GEN.36.6	Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and 
GEN.36.8	So Esau dwelt in 
GEN.36.9	And this 
GEN.36.10	These 
GEN.36.11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
GEN.36.12	Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, Esau’s son, and she bore 
GEN.36.13	These 
GEN.36.14	These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These 
GEN.36.16	Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, 
GEN.36.17	These 
GEN.36.18	And these 
GEN.36.19	These 
GEN.36.20	These 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These 
GEN.36.22	And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister 
GEN.36.23	These 
GEN.36.24	These 
GEN.36.25	These 
GEN.36.26	These 
GEN.36.27	These 
GEN.36.28	These 
GEN.36.29	These 
GEN.36.30	Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These 
GEN.36.31	Now these 
GEN.36.32	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city 
GEN.36.33	And when Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.35	And when Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who attacked Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city 
GEN.36.36	When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.37	And when Samlah died, Saul of 
GEN.36.38	When Saul died, Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.39	And when Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place; and the name of his city 
GEN.36.40	And these 
GEN.36.41	Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Chief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These 
GEN.37.1	Now Jacob dwelt in the land 
GEN.37.2	This 
GEN.37.2	Joseph, 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he 
GEN.37.4	But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they 
GEN.37.5	Now Joseph had a dream, and he told 
GEN.37.6	So he said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: 
GEN.37.7	There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.”
GEN.37.8	And his brothers said to him, “Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
GEN.37.9	Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, “Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, 
GEN.37.10	So he told 
GEN.37.11	And 
GEN.37.12	Then his brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers feeding 
GEN.37.13	So he said to him, “Here I am.”
GEN.37.14	Then he said to him, “Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me.” So he sent him out of the Valley of 
GEN.37.15	Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, “What are you seeking?”
GEN.37.16	So he said, “I am seeking my brothers. 
GEN.37.17	And the man said, “They have departed from here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in 
GEN.37.18	Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, 
GEN.37.19	Then they said to one another, “Look, this dreamer is coming! 
GEN.37.20	Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, ‘Some wild beast has devoured him.’ We shall see what will become of his dreams!”
GEN.37.21	But 
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood, 
GEN.37.23	So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they 
GEN.37.24	Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit 
GEN.37.25	And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of 
GEN.37.26	So Judah said to his brothers, “What profit 
GEN.37.27	Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and 
GEN.37.28	Then 
GEN.37.29	Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph 
GEN.37.30	And he returned to his brothers and said, “The lad 
GEN.37.31	So they took 
GEN.37.32	Then they sent the tunic of 
GEN.37.33	And he recognized it and said, “
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob 
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and all his daughters 
GEN.37.36	Now 
GEN.38.1	It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and 
GEN.38.2	And Judah 
GEN.38.3	So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name 
GEN.38.4	She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name 
GEN.38.5	And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name 
GEN.38.6	Then Judah 
GEN.38.7	But 
GEN.38.8	And Judah said to Onan, “Go in to 
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the heir would not be 
GEN.38.10	And the thing which he did displeased the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, 
GEN.38.12	Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah 
GEN.38.13	And it was told Tamar, saying, “Look, your father-in-law is going up 
GEN.38.14	So she took off her widow’s garments, covered 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she 
GEN.38.16	Then he turned to her by the way, and said, “Please let me come in to you”; for he did not know that she 
GEN.38.16	So she said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
GEN.38.17	And he said, 
GEN.38.17	So she said, 
GEN.38.18	Then he said, “What pledge shall I give you?”
GEN.38.18	So she said, 
GEN.38.19	So she arose and went away, and 
GEN.38.20	And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive 
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot who 
GEN.38.21	And they said, “There was no harlot in this 
GEN.38.22	So he returned to Judah and said, “I cannot find her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot in this 
GEN.38.23	Then Judah said, “Let her take 
GEN.38.24	And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has 
GEN.38.24	So Judah said, “Bring her out 
GEN.38.25	When she 
GEN.38.26	So Judah 
GEN.38.27	Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins 
GEN.38.28	And so it was, when she was giving birth, that 
GEN.38.29	Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out unexpectedly; and she said, “How did you break through? 
GEN.38.30	Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet 
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been taken 
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	And his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	So Joseph 
GEN.39.5	So it was, from the time 
GEN.39.6	Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate.
GEN.39.6	Now Joseph 
GEN.39.7	And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife cast longing eyes on Joseph, and she said, 
GEN.39.8	But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not know what 
GEN.39.10	So it was, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he 
GEN.39.11	But it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house 
GEN.39.12	that she 
GEN.39.13	And so it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside, 
GEN.39.14	that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, “See, he has brought in to us a 
GEN.39.15	And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.”
GEN.39.16	So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she 
GEN.39.18	so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.”
GEN.39.19	So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, “Your servant did to me after this manner,” that his 
GEN.39.20	Then Joseph’s master took him and 
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison 
GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison did not look into anything 
GEN.40.1	It came to pass after these things 
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was 
GEN.40.3	So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Joseph 
GEN.40.4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a while.
GEN.40.5	Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who 
GEN.40.6	And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and saw that they 
GEN.40.7	So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who 
GEN.40.8	And they said to him, 
GEN.40.8	So Joseph said to them, 
GEN.40.9	Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “Behold, in my dream a vine 
GEN.40.10	and in the vine 
GEN.40.11	Then Pharaoh’s cup 
GEN.40.12	And Joseph said to him, 
GEN.40.13	Now within three days Pharaoh will 
GEN.40.14	But 
GEN.40.15	For indeed I was 
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also 
GEN.40.17	In the uppermost basket 
GEN.40.18	So Joseph answered and said, 
GEN.40.19	Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and 
GEN.40.20	Now it came to pass on the third day, 
GEN.40.21	Then he 
GEN.40.22	But he 
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but 
GEN.41.1	Then it came to pass, at the end of two full years, that 
GEN.41.2	Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow. 
GEN.41.3	Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly and gaunt, and stood by the 
GEN.41.4	And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke. 
GEN.41.5	He slept and dreamed a second time; and suddenly seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good. 
GEN.41.6	Then behold, seven thin heads, blighted by the 
GEN.41.7	And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, 
GEN.41.8	Now it came to pass in the morning 
GEN.41.9	Then the 
GEN.41.10	When Pharaoh was 
GEN.41.11	we each had a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his 
GEN.41.12	Now there 
GEN.41.13	And it came to pass, just 
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they 
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and 
GEN.41.16	So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.41.17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “Behold, 
GEN.41.18	Suddenly seven cows came up out of the river, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow. 
GEN.41.19	Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows. 
GEN.41.21	When they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they 
GEN.41.22	Also I saw in my dream, and suddenly seven heads came up on one stalk, full and good. 
GEN.41.23	Then behold, seven heads, withered, thin, 
GEN.41.24	And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. So 
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows 
GEN.41.27	And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them 
GEN.41.28	This 
GEN.41.29	Indeed 
GEN.41.30	but after them seven years of famine will 
GEN.41.31	So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following, for it 
GEN.41.32	And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the 
GEN.41.33	“Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do 
GEN.41.35	And 
GEN.41.36	Then that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land 
GEN.41.37	So 
GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find 
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, 
GEN.41.40	You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.” 
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh 
GEN.41.43	And he had him ride in the second 
GEN.41.44	Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I 
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife 
GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he 
GEN.41.47	Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth abundantly. 
GEN.41.48	So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them. 
GEN.41.49	Joseph gathered very much grain, 
GEN.41.50	And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: “For God has made me forget all my toil and all my 
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second he called Ephraim: “For God has caused me to be 
GEN.41.53	Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended, 
GEN.41.54	and the seven years of famine began to come, 
GEN.41.55	So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; 
GEN.41.56	The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and 
GEN.41.57	So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to 
GEN.42.1	When 
GEN.42.2	And he said, “Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down to that place and buy for us there, that we may 
GEN.42.3	So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, 
GEN.42.5	And the sons of Israel went to buy 
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph 
GEN.42.7	Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as 
GEN.42.7	And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”
GEN.42.8	So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	Then Joseph 
GEN.42.10	And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We 
GEN.42.12	But he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
GEN.42.13	And they said, “Your servants 
GEN.42.14	But Joseph said to them, “It 
GEN.42.15	In this 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether 
GEN.42.17	So he put them all together in prison 
GEN.42.18	Then Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this and live, 
GEN.42.19	If you 
GEN.42.20	And bring your young
GEN.42.20	And they did so. 
GEN.42.21	Then they said to one another, 
GEN.42.22	And Reuben answered them, saying, 
GEN.42.23	But they did not know that Joseph understood 
GEN.42.24	And he turned himself away from them and 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph 
GEN.42.26	So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there. 
GEN.42.27	But as 
GEN.42.28	So he said to his brothers, “My money has been restored, and there it is, in my sack!” Then their hearts failed 
GEN.42.29	Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying: 
GEN.42.30	“The man 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him, ‘We 
GEN.42.32	We 
GEN.42.33	Then the man, the lord of the country, said to us, 
GEN.42.34	And bring your 
GEN.42.35	Then it happened as they emptied their sacks, that surprisingly 
GEN.42.36	And Jacob their father said to them, “You have 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons if I do not bring him 
GEN.42.38	But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for 
GEN.43.1	Now the famine 
GEN.43.2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go 
GEN.43.3	But Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your 
GEN.43.4	If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. 
GEN.43.5	But if you will not send 
GEN.43.6	And Israel said, “Why did you deal 
GEN.43.7	But they said, “The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family, saying, ‘
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may 
GEN.43.9	I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. 
GEN.43.10	For if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.”
GEN.43.11	And their father Israel said to them, “If 
GEN.43.12	Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man. 
GEN.43.14	And may God 
GEN.43.15	So the men took that present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the 
GEN.43.17	Then the man did as Joseph ordered, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
GEN.43.18	Now the men were 
GEN.43.19	When they drew near to the steward of Joseph’s house, they talked with him at the door of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, “O sir, 
GEN.43.21	but 
GEN.43.22	And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	But he said, “Peace 
GEN.43.24	So the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and 
GEN.43.25	Then they made the present ready for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which 
GEN.43.27	Then he asked them about 
GEN.43.28	And they answered, “Your servant our father 
GEN.43.29	Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, 
GEN.43.30	Now 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, “Serve the 
GEN.43.32	So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the 
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his 
GEN.43.34	Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin’s serving was 
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the 
GEN.44.2	Also put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money.” So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	When they had gone out of the city, 
GEN.44.5	 not this 
GEN.44.6	So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words. 
GEN.44.7	And they said to him, “Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing. 
GEN.44.8	Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan 
GEN.44.9	With whomever of your servants it is found, 
GEN.44.10	And he said, “Now also 
GEN.44.11	Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	So he searched. He began with the oldest and left off with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they 
GEN.44.14	So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he 
GEN.44.15	And Joseph said to them, “What deed 
GEN.44.16	Then Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has 
GEN.44.17	But he said, 
GEN.44.18	Then Judah came near to him and said: “O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s hearing, and 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, 
GEN.44.22	And we said to my lord, 
GEN.44.23	But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’
GEN.44.24	“So it was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	And 
GEN.44.26	But we said, ‘We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother 
GEN.44.27	Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that 
GEN.44.28	and the one went out from me, and I said, 
GEN.44.29	But if you 
GEN.44.30	“Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad 
GEN.44.31	it will happen, when he sees that the lad 
GEN.44.32	For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, 
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, please 
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father if the lad 
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, “Make everyone go out from me!” So no one stood with him 
GEN.45.2	And he 
GEN.45.3	Then Joseph said to his brothers, 
GEN.45.4	And Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near to me.” So they came near. Then he said: “I 
GEN.45.5	But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here; 
GEN.45.6	For these two years the 
GEN.45.7	And God 
GEN.45.8	So now 
GEN.45.9	“Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph: “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry. 
GEN.45.10	You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children’s children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have. 
GEN.45.11	There I will 
GEN.45.12	“And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that 
GEN.45.13	So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and 
GEN.45.14	Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
GEN.45.15	Moreover he 
GEN.45.16	Now the report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” So it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well. 
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat 
GEN.45.19	Now you are commanded—do this: Take carts out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come. 
GEN.45.20	Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt 
GEN.45.21	Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them 
GEN.45.22	He gave to all of them, to each man, 
GEN.45.23	And he sent to his father these 
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, “See that you do not become troubled along the way.”
GEN.45.25	Then they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. 
GEN.45.26	And they told him, saying, “Joseph 
GEN.45.27	But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit 
GEN.45.28	Then Israel said, “
GEN.46.1	So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to 
GEN.46.2	Then God spoke to Israel 
GEN.46.2	And he said, “Here I am.”
GEN.46.3	So He said, “I 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely 
GEN.46.5	Then 
GEN.46.6	So they took their livestock and their goods, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to Egypt, 
GEN.46.7	His sons and his sons’ sons, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.
GEN.46.8	Now 
GEN.46.9	The 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon 
GEN.46.11	The sons of 
GEN.46.12	The sons of 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar 
GEN.46.14	The 
GEN.46.15	These 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher 
GEN.46.18	These 
GEN.46.19	The 
GEN.46.20	And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.46.21	The sons of Benjamin 
GEN.46.22	These 
GEN.46.23	The son of Dan 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali 
GEN.46.25	These 
GEN.46.26	All the persons who went with Jacob to Egypt, who came from his body, 
GEN.46.27	And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt 
GEN.46.28	Then he sent Judah before him to Joseph, 
GEN.46.29	So Joseph made ready his 
GEN.46.30	And Israel said to Joseph, 
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, 
GEN.46.32	And the men 
GEN.46.33	So it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you and says, 
GEN.46.34	that you shall say, ‘Your servants’ occupation has been with livestock 
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph 
GEN.47.2	And he took five men from among his brothers and 
GEN.47.3	Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, 
GEN.47.3	And they said to Pharaoh, 
GEN.47.4	And they said to Pharaoh, 
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt 
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob 
GEN.47.8	Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old 
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh, 
GEN.47.10	So Jacob 
GEN.47.11	And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of 
GEN.47.12	Then Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all 
GEN.47.13	Now 
GEN.47.14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
GEN.47.15	So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, for 
GEN.47.16	Then Joseph said, “Give your livestock, and I will give you 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread 
GEN.47.18	When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our herds of livestock. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give 
GEN.47.20	Then Joseph 
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Indeed I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Look, 
GEN.47.24	And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh. Four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your households and as food for your little ones.”
GEN.47.25	So they said, “You have saved 
GEN.47.26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, 
GEN.47.27	So Israel 
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the length of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years. 
GEN.47.29	When the time 
GEN.47.30	but 
GEN.47.30	And he said, “I will do as you have said.”
GEN.47.31	Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. So 
GEN.48.1	Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, “Indeed your father 
GEN.48.2	And Jacob was told, “Look, your son Joseph is coming to you”; and Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. 
GEN.48.3	Then Jacob said to Joseph: “God 
GEN.48.4	and said to me, ‘Behold, I will 
GEN.48.5	And now your 
GEN.48.6	Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	But as for me, when I came from Padan, 
GEN.48.8	Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who 
GEN.48.9	And Joseph said to his father, “They 
GEN.48.9	And he said, “Please bring them to me, and 
GEN.48.10	Now 
GEN.48.11	And Israel said to Joseph, 
GEN.48.12	So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth. 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought 
GEN.48.14	Then Israel stretched out his right hand and 
GEN.48.15	And 
GEN.48.15	“God, 
GEN.48.15	The God who has fed me all my life long to this day,

GEN.48.18	And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this 
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, 
GEN.48.20	So he blessed them that day, saying, 
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but 
GEN.48.22	Moreover 
GEN.49.1	And Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather together, that I may 
GEN.49.2	“Gather together and hear, you sons of Jacob,
GEN.49.2	And listen to Israel your father.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, you are

GEN.49.7	And their wrath, for it is cruel!
GEN.49.7	I will divide them in Jacob

GEN.49.8	Your father’s children shall bow down before you.
GEN.49.9	Judah

GEN.49.28	All these 
GEN.49.29	Then he charged them and said to them: “I

GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, 
GEN.49.32	The field and the cave that 
GEN.49.33	And when Jacob had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph 
GEN.50.2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to 
GEN.50.3	Forty days were required for him, for such are the days required for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians 
GEN.50.4	Now when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to 
GEN.50.5	‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying; in my grave 
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
GEN.50.8	as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great gathering.
GEN.50.10	Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which 
GEN.50.11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This 
GEN.50.12	So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them. 
GEN.50.13	For 
GEN.50.14	And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, 
GEN.50.16	So they sent 
GEN.50.17	‘Thus you shall say to Joseph: “I beg you, please forgive the trespass of your brothers and their sin;

GEN.50.19	Joseph said to them, 
GEN.50.20	But as for you, you meant evil against me; 
GEN.50.21	Now therefore, do not be afraid; 
GEN.50.22	So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s household. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	Joseph saw Ephraim’s children 
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said to his brethren, “I am dying; but

GEN.50.26	So Joseph died,

EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	All those who were descendants of Jacob were 
EXO.1.6	And 
EXO.1.7	But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, 
EXO.1.9	And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the children of Israel 
EXO.1.10	come, let us 
EXO.1.11	Therefore they set taskmasters over them 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel. 
EXO.1.13	So the Egyptians made the children of Israel 
EXO.1.14	And they 
EXO.1.15	Then the king of Egypt spoke to the 
EXO.1.16	and he said, “When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives 
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?”
EXO.1.19	And 
EXO.1.20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty. 
EXO.1.21	And so it was, because the midwives feared God, 
EXO.1.22	So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, 
EXO.2.1	And 
EXO.2.2	So the woman conceived and bore a son. And 
EXO.2.3	But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of

EXO.2.5	Then the 
EXO.2.6	And when she opened 
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the maiden went and called the child’s mother. 
EXO.2.9	Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give 
EXO.2.10	And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became 
EXO.2.11	Now it came to pass in those days, 
EXO.2.12	So he looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he 
EXO.2.13	And 
EXO.2.14	Then he said, 
EXO.2.14	So Moses 
EXO.2.15	When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. 
EXO.2.17	Then the 
EXO.2.18	When they came to 
EXO.2.19	And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.”
EXO.2.20	So he said to his daughters, “And where 
EXO.2.21	Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave

EXO.2.24	So God 
EXO.2.25	And God

EXO.3.8	So 
EXO.3.9	Now therefore, behold, 
EXO.3.10	Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, 
EXO.3.12	So He said, 
EXO.3.13	Then Moses said to God, “Indeed, 
EXO.3.14	And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, 
EXO.3.15	Moreover God said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘The

EXO.3.18	Then 
EXO.3.19	But I am sure that the king of Egypt 
EXO.3.20	So I will 
EXO.3.21	And 
EXO.3.22	But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, namely, of her who dwells near her house,

EXO.4.17	And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.”
EXO.4.18	So Moses went and returned to 
EXO.4.18	And Jethro said to Moses,

EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron 
EXO.4.30	And Aaron spoke all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	So the people 
EXO.5.1	Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, “Thus says the 
EXO.5.2	And Pharaoh said, 
EXO.5.3	So they said, 
EXO.5.4	Then the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people from their work? Get 
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land 
EXO.5.6	So the same day Pharaoh commanded the 
EXO.5.7	“You shall no longer give the people straw to make 
EXO.5.8	And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before. You shall not reduce it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, ‘Let us go 
EXO.5.9	Let more work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard false words.”
EXO.5.10	And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh: ‘I will not give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go, get yourselves straw where you can find it; yet none of your work will be reduced.’ ” 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters forced 
EXO.5.14	Also the 
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why are you dealing thus with your servants? 
EXO.5.16	There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, ‘Make brick!’ And indeed your servants 
EXO.5.17	But he said, “You 
EXO.5.18	Therefore go now 
EXO.5.19	And the officers of the children of Israel saw 
EXO.5.20	Then, as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron who stood there to meet them. 
EXO.5.21	And they said to them, “Let the 
EXO.5.22	So Moses returned to the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered Your people at all.”
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	And God spoke to Moses and said to him: “I 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as 
EXO.6.4	I have also established My covenant with them, 
EXO.6.5	And 
EXO.6.6	Therefore say to the children of Israel: 
EXO.6.7	I will 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you into the land which I 
EXO.6.9	So Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; 
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	“Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land.”
EXO.6.12	And Moses spoke before the 
EXO.6.13	Then the 
EXO.6.14	These 
EXO.6.15	And the sons of Simeon 
EXO.6.16	These 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon 
EXO.6.18	And 
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari 
EXO.6.20	Now 
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar 
EXO.6.22	And 
EXO.6.23	Aaron took to himself Elisheba, daughter of 
EXO.6.24	And 
EXO.6.25	Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and 
EXO.6.26	These 
EXO.6.27	These 
EXO.6.28	And it came to pass, on the day the 
EXO.6.29	that the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses said before the 
EXO.7.1	So the 
EXO.7.2	You 
EXO.7.3	And 
EXO.7.4	But 
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians 
EXO.7.6	Then Moses and Aaron 
EXO.7.7	And Moses 
EXO.7.8	Then the 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just 
EXO.7.11	But Pharaoh also 
EXO.7.12	For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. 
EXO.7.13	And Pharaoh’s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the 
EXO.7.14	So the 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the 
EXO.7.16	And you shall say to him, 
EXO.7.17	Thus says the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that 
EXO.7.19	Then the 
EXO.7.20	And Moses and Aaron did so, just as the 
EXO.7.21	The fish that 
EXO.7.22	Then the magicians of Egypt did 
EXO.7.23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither was his heart moved by this. 
EXO.7.24	So all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river. 
EXO.7.25	And seven days passed after the 
EXO.8.1	And the 
EXO.8.2	But if you 
EXO.8.3	So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your 
EXO.8.4	And the frogs shall come up on you, on your people, and on all your servants.” ’ ”
EXO.8.5	Then the 
EXO.8.6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and 
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, 
EXO.8.9	And Moses said to Pharaoh, “Accept the honor of saying when I shall intercede for you, for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, 
EXO.8.10	So he said, “Tomorrow.” And he said, “
EXO.8.11	And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.”
EXO.8.12	Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses 
EXO.8.13	So the 
EXO.8.14	They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was 
EXO.8.16	So the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and 
EXO.8.18	Now 
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This 
EXO.8.20	And the 
EXO.8.21	Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms 
EXO.8.22	And in that day 
EXO.8.23	I will make a difference between My people and your people. Tomorrow this 
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.”
EXO.8.26	And Moses said, “It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing 
EXO.8.27	We will go 
EXO.8.28	So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	Then Moses said, “Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat the 
EXO.8.30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	But Pharaoh 
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if you 
EXO.9.3	behold, the 
EXO.9.4	And 
EXO.9.5	Then the 
EXO.9.6	So the 
EXO.9.7	Then Pharaoh sent, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. But the 
EXO.9.8	So the 
EXO.9.9	And it will become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it will cause 
EXO.9.10	Then they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses scattered 
EXO.9.11	And the 
EXO.9.12	But the 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart, and on your servants and on your people, 
EXO.9.15	Now if I had 
EXO.9.16	But indeed for 
EXO.9.17	As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go. 
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now. 
EXO.9.19	Therefore send now 
EXO.9.20	He who 
EXO.9.21	But he who did not regard the word of the 
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23	And Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven; and 
EXO.9.24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	And the 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel 
EXO.9.27	And Pharaoh sent and 
EXO.9.28	Entreat the 
EXO.9.29	So Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will 
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, 
EXO.9.31	Now the flax and the barley were struck, 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they 
EXO.9.33	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and 
EXO.9.34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	So 
EXO.10.1	Now the 
EXO.10.2	and that 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the 
EXO.10.4	Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring 
EXO.10.5	And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the earth; and 
EXO.10.6	They shall 
EXO.10.7	Then Pharaoh’s 
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	And Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for 
EXO.10.10	Then he said to them, “The 
EXO.10.11	Not so! Go now, you 
EXO.10.12	Then the 
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	And 
EXO.10.15	For they 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and 
EXO.10.18	So he 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	Then the 
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was 
EXO.10.23	They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. 
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh called to Moses and 
EXO.10.25	But Moses said, “You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the 
EXO.10.26	Our 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	Then Pharaoh said to him, 
EXO.10.29	So Moses said, “You have spoken well. 
EXO.11.1	And the 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the hearing of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor, articles of silver and 
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	Then Moses said, “Thus says the 
EXO.11.5	and 
EXO.11.6	Then there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, 
EXO.11.7	But against none of the children of Israel 
EXO.11.8	And 
EXO.11.9	But the 
EXO.11.10	So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; 
EXO.12.1	Now the 
EXO.12.2	“This month 
EXO.12.3	Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: ‘On the 
EXO.12.4	And if the household is too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be 
EXO.12.6	Now you shall keep it until the 
EXO.12.7	And they shall take 
EXO.12.8	Then they shall eat the flesh on that 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but 
EXO.12.10	You shall let none of it remain until morning, and what remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire. 
EXO.12.11	And thus you shall eat it: 
EXO.12.12	‘For I 
EXO.12.13	Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you 
EXO.12.14	‘So this day shall be to you 
EXO.12.15	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, 
EXO.12.16	On the first day 
EXO.12.17	So you shall observe 
EXO.12.18	In the first 
EXO.12.19	For 
EXO.12.20	You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.’ ”
EXO.12.21	Then 
EXO.12.22	And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip 
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	And you shall 
EXO.12.25	It will come to pass when you come to the land which the 
EXO.12.26	And it shall be, when your children say to you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’ 
EXO.12.27	that you shall say, 
EXO.12.28	Then the children of Israel went away and 
EXO.12.29	And it came to pass at midnight that 
EXO.12.30	So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for 
EXO.12.31	Then he 
EXO.12.32	Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.”
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	Now the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they had asked from the Egyptians 
EXO.12.36	And the 
EXO.12.37	Then 
EXO.12.38	A 
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because 
EXO.12.40	Now the sojourn of the children of Israel who lived in Egypt 
EXO.12.41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years—on that very same day—it came to pass that 
EXO.12.42	It 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	But every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have 
EXO.12.45	A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat it. 
EXO.12.46	In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
EXO.12.48	And 
EXO.12.49	One law shall be for the native-born and for the stranger who dwells among you.”
EXO.12.50	Thus all the children of Israel did; as the 
EXO.12.51	And it came to pass, on that very same day, that the 
EXO.13.1	Then the 
EXO.13.2	“Consecrate to Me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, 
EXO.13.3	And Moses said to the people: 
EXO.13.4	On this day you are going out, in the month Abib. 
EXO.13.5	And it shall be, when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And 
EXO.13.8	And you shall 
EXO.13.9	It shall be as 
EXO.13.10	You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
EXO.13.11	“And it shall be, when the 
EXO.13.12	that you shall set apart to the 
EXO.13.13	But 
EXO.13.14	So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What 
EXO.13.15	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that 
EXO.13.16	It shall be as 
EXO.13.17	Then it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them 
EXO.13.18	So God 
EXO.13.19	And Moses took the 
EXO.13.20	So 
EXO.13.21	And 
EXO.13.22	He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night 
EXO.14.1	Now the 
EXO.14.2	“Speak to the children of Israel, 
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 
EXO.14.4	Then 
EXO.14.5	Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and 
EXO.14.6	So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him. 
EXO.14.7	Also, he took 
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	So the 
EXO.14.10	And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel 
EXO.14.11	Then they said to Moses, “Because 
EXO.14.12	 this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For 
EXO.14.13	And Moses said to the people, 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	And the 
EXO.14.16	But 
EXO.14.17	And I indeed will 
EXO.14.18	Then the Egyptians shall know that I 
EXO.14.19	And the Angel of God, 
EXO.14.20	So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness 
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the 
EXO.14.22	So 
EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
EXO.14.24	Now it came to pass, in the morning 
EXO.14.25	And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the 
EXO.14.26	Then the 
EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea 
EXO.14.28	Then 
EXO.14.29	But 
EXO.14.30	So the 
EXO.14.31	Thus Israel saw the great work which the 
EXO.15.1	Then 
EXO.15.1	“I will 
EXO.15.1	For He has triumphed gloriously!
EXO.15.1	The horse and its rider
EXO.15.1	He has thrown into the sea!
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.2	And He has become my salvation;
EXO.15.2	He 
EXO.15.2	My 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea;
EXO.15.4	His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The depths have covered them;
EXO.15.5	They sank to the bottom like a stone.
EXO.15.6	“Your 
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O 
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of Your 
EXO.15.7	You have overthrown those who rose against You;
EXO.15.7	You sent forth 
EXO.15.7	It 
EXO.15.8	And 
EXO.15.8	The waters were gathered together;
EXO.15.8	The floods stood upright like a heap;
EXO.15.8	The depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue,
EXO.15.9	I will overtake,
EXO.15.9	I will 
EXO.15.9	My desire shall be satisfied on them.
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword,
EXO.15.9	My hand shall destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	You blew with Your wind,
EXO.15.10	The sea covered them;
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	“Who 
EXO.15.11	Who 
EXO.15.11	Fearful in 
EXO.15.12	You stretched out Your right hand;
EXO.15.12	The earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	You in Your mercy have 
EXO.15.13	The people whom You have redeemed;
EXO.15.13	You have guided 
EXO.15.13	To 
EXO.15.14	“The 
EXO.15.14	Sorrow will take hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Then 
EXO.15.15	The mighty men of Moab,
EXO.15.15	Trembling will take hold of them;
EXO.15.15	All the inhabitants of Canaan will 
EXO.15.16	Fear and dread will fall on them;
EXO.15.16	By the greatness of Your arm
EXO.15.16	They will be 
EXO.15.16	Till Your people pass over, O 
EXO.15.16	Till the people pass over
EXO.15.16	Whom You have purchased.
EXO.15.17	You will bring them in and 
EXO.15.17	In the 
EXO.15.17	 the place, O 
EXO.15.17	For Your own dwelling,
EXO.15.17	The 
EXO.15.18	“The
EXO.15.19	For the 
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam 
EXO.15.21	And Miriam 
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	For He has triumphed gloriously!
EXO.15.21	The horse and its rider
EXO.15.21	He has thrown into the sea!”
EXO.15.22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea; then they went out into the Wilderness of 
EXO.15.23	Now when they came to 
EXO.15.24	And the people 
EXO.15.25	So he cried out to the 
EXO.15.25	There He 
EXO.15.26	and said, 
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim, where there 
EXO.16.1	And they 
EXO.16.2	Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel 
EXO.16.3	And the children of Israel said to them, 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and 
EXO.16.6	Then Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, 
EXO.16.7	And in the morning you shall see 
EXO.16.8	Also Moses said, “
EXO.16.9	Then Moses spoke to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, 
EXO.16.10	Now it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 
EXO.16.13	So it was that 
EXO.16.14	And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, was 
EXO.16.15	So when the children of Israel saw 
EXO.16.15	And Moses said to them, 
EXO.16.16	This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.17	Then the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	So when they measured 
EXO.16.19	And Moses said, “Let no one 
EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they did not heed Moses. But some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. 
EXO.16.21	So they gathered it every morning, every man according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	And so it was, on the sixth day, 
EXO.16.23	Then he said to them, “This 
EXO.16.24	So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not 
EXO.16.25	Then Moses said, “Eat that today, for today 
EXO.16.26	Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”
EXO.16.27	Now it happened 
EXO.16.28	And the 
EXO.16.29	See! For the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And 
EXO.16.32	Then Moses said, “This 
EXO.16.33	And Moses said to Aaron, 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	And the children of Israel 
EXO.16.36	Now an omer 
EXO.17.1	Then 
EXO.17.2	Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, “Give us water, that we may drink.”
EXO.17.2	So Moses said to them, “Why do you contend with me? Why do you 
EXO.17.3	And the people thirsted there for water, and the people 
EXO.17.4	So Moses 
EXO.17.5	And the 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.”
EXO.17.6	And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	So he called the name of the place 
EXO.17.8	Now Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose us some men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	And so it was, when Moses 
EXO.17.12	But Moses’ hands 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.14	Then the 
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar and called its name, The-
EXO.17.16	for he said, “Because the 
EXO.18.1	And 
EXO.18.2	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took

EXO.31.4	to design artistic works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, 
EXO.31.5	in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all

EXO.31.9	the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and 
EXO.31.10	the garments of ministry, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests,

EXO.31.16	Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations 
EXO.31.17	It 
EXO.31.18	And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses 
EXO.32.1	Now when the people saw that Moses 
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said to them, “Break off the 
EXO.32.3	So all the people broke off the golden earrings which 
EXO.32.4	And he received 
EXO.32.4	Then they said, “This 
EXO.32.5	So when Aaron saw 
EXO.32.6	Then they rose early on the next day, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people 
EXO.32.7	And the 
EXO.32.8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which 
EXO.32.9	And the 
EXO.32.10	Now therefore, 
EXO.32.11	Then Moses pleaded with the 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, ‘He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and 
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You 
EXO.32.14	So the 
EXO.32.15	And 
EXO.32.16	Now the 
EXO.32.17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “
EXO.32.18	But he said:
EXO.32.18	“
EXO.32.18	Nor the noise of the cry of defeat,
EXO.32.18	 the sound of singing I hear.”
EXO.32.19	So it was, as soon as he came near the camp, that 
EXO.32.20	Then he took the calf which they had made, burned 
EXO.32.21	And Moses said to Aaron, 
EXO.32.22	So Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord become hot. 
EXO.32.23	For they said to me, ‘Make us gods that shall go before us; 
EXO.32.24	And I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them break 
EXO.32.25	Now when Moses saw that the people 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the entrance of the camp, and said, “Whoever 
EXO.32.27	And he said to them, “Thus says the 
EXO.32.28	So the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And about three thousand men of the people fell that day. 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to the 
EXO.32.30	Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses said to the people, 
EXO.32.31	Then Moses 
EXO.32.32	Yet now, if You will forgive their sin—but if not, I pray, 
EXO.32.33	And the 
EXO.32.34	Now therefore, go, lead the people to 
EXO.32.35	So the 
EXO.33.1	Then the 
EXO.33.2	And I will send 
EXO.33.4	And when the people heard this bad news, 
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.
EXO.33.7	Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and 
EXO.33.8	So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, 
EXO.33.9	And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood 
EXO.33.10	All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing 
EXO.33.11	So 
EXO.33.12	Then Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray, 
EXO.33.14	And He said, 
EXO.33.15	Then he said to Him, 
EXO.33.16	For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight, 
EXO.33.17	So the 
EXO.33.18	And he said, “Please, show me 
EXO.33.19	Then He said, “I will make all My 
EXO.33.20	But He said, “You cannot see My face; for 
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall 
EXO.34.1	And the 
EXO.34.2	So be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there 
EXO.34.3	And no man shall

EXO.34.5	Now the 
EXO.34.6	And the 
EXO.34.7	keeping mercy for thousands, 
EXO.34.8	So Moses made haste and 
EXO.34.9	Then he said, “If now I have found grace in Your sight, O Lord, 
EXO.34.10	And He said: “Behold, 
EXO.34.11	Observe what I command you this day. Behold, 
EXO.34.12	Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst. 
EXO.34.13	But you shall 
EXO.34.14	(for you shall worship 
EXO.34.15	lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they

EXO.34.22	“And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year’s end.
EXO.34.23	“Three times in the year all your men shall appear before the Lord, the 
EXO.34.24	For I will 
EXO.34.25	“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, 
EXO.34.26	“The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the 
EXO.34.27	Then the 
EXO.34.28	So he was there with the 
EXO.34.29	Now it was so, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (and the 
EXO.34.30	So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, 
EXO.34.31	Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all the children of Israel came near, 
EXO.34.33	And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put 
EXO.34.34	But 
EXO.34.35	And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.
EXO.35.1	Then Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, 
EXO.35.2	Work shall be done for 
EXO.35.3	You shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
EXO.35.4	And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, 
EXO.35.5	‘Take from among you an offering to the 
EXO.35.6	blue, purple, and scarlet 
EXO.35.7	ram skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood; 
EXO.35.8	oil for the light,

EXO.35.14	also 
EXO.35.15	the incense altar, its poles, 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, all its utensils, 
EXO.35.17	the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 
EXO.35.18	the pegs of the tabernacle, the pegs of the court, and their cords; 
EXO.35.19	the garments of ministry, for ministering in the holy 
EXO.35.20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
EXO.35.21	Then everyone came 
EXO.35.22	They came, both men and women, as many as had a willing heart, 
EXO.35.23	And 
EXO.35.24	Everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the 
EXO.35.25	All the women 
EXO.35.26	And all the women whose hearts stirred with wisdom spun yarn of goats’ 
EXO.35.27	The rulers brought onyx stones, and the stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate, 
EXO.35.28	and 
EXO.35.29	The children of Israel brought a

EXO.35.31	and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, in knowledge and all manner of workmanship, 
EXO.35.32	to design artistic works, to work in gold and silver and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of artistic workmanship.
EXO.35.34	“And He has put in his heart the ability to teach, 
EXO.35.35	He has

EXO.36.2	Then Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in 
EXO.36.3	And they received from Moses all the 
EXO.36.4	Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing, 
EXO.36.5	and they spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.36.6	So Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.” And the people were restrained from bringing, 
EXO.36.7	for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done—indeed too 
EXO.36.8	Then all the gifted artisans among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains woven of fine linen, and of blue, purple, and scarlet 
EXO.36.9	The length of each curtain 
EXO.36.10	And he coupled five curtains to one another, and 
EXO.36.11	He made loops of blue 
EXO.36.12	Fifty loops he made on one curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain on the end of the second set; the loops held one 
EXO.36.13	And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps, that it might be one tabernacle.
EXO.36.14	He made curtains of goats’ 
EXO.36.15	The length of each curtain 
EXO.36.16	He coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves. 
EXO.36.17	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in one set, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain of the second set. 
EXO.36.18	He also made fifty bronze clasps to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
EXO.36.19	Then he made a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red, and a covering of badger skins above 
EXO.36.20	For the tabernacle 
EXO.36.21	The length of each board 
EXO.36.22	Each board had two tenons 
EXO.36.23	And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side. 
EXO.36.24	Forty sockets of silver he made to go under the twenty boards: two sockets under each of the boards for its two tenons. 
EXO.36.25	And for the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards 
EXO.36.26	and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each of the boards. 
EXO.36.27	For the west side of the tabernacle he made six boards. 
EXO.36.28	He also made two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.29	And they were coupled at the bottom and coupled together at the top by one ring. Thus he made both of them for the two corners. 
EXO.36.30	So there were eight boards and their sockets—sixteen sockets of silver—two sockets under each of the boards.
EXO.36.31	And he made 
EXO.36.32	five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle on the far side westward.

EXO.37.5	And he put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
EXO.37.6	He also made the 
EXO.37.7	He made two cherubim of beaten gold; he made them of one piece at the two ends of the mercy seat:

EXO.38.5	He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating, 
EXO.38.6	And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	Then he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to bear it. He made the altar hollow with boards.

EXO.39.33	And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
EXO.39.34	the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering; 
EXO.39.35	the ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the mercy seat;

EXO.39.41	and the garments of ministry, to minister in the holy 
EXO.39.42	According to all that the 
EXO.39.43	Then Moses looked over all the work, and indeed they had done it; as the 
EXO.40.1	Then the 
EXO.40.2	“On the first day of the 
EXO.40.3	You shall put in it the ark of the Testimony, and partition off the ark with the veil.

EXO.40.17	And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first 
EXO.40.18	So Moses raised up the tabernacle, fastened its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. 
EXO.40.19	And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as the 
EXO.40.20	He took 
EXO.40.21	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, 
EXO.40.22	He put the table in the tabernacle of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil; 
EXO.40.23	and he set the bread in order upon it before the 
EXO.40.24	He put the lampstand in the tabernacle of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle; 
EXO.40.25	and 
EXO.40.26	He put the gold altar in the tabernacle of meeting in front of the veil; 
EXO.40.27	and he burned sweet incense on it, as the 
EXO.40.28	He hung up the screen 
EXO.40.29	And he put the altar of burnt offering 
EXO.40.30	He set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water there for washing; 
EXO.40.31	and Moses, Aaron, and his sons would 
EXO.40.32	Whenever they went into the tabernacle of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, 
EXO.40.33	And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the screen of the court gate. So Moses

LEV.8.10	Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them. 
LEV.8.11	He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them. 
LEV.8.12	And he 
LEV.8.13	Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put tunics on them, girded them with sashes, and put hats on them, as the 
LEV.8.14	And he brought the bull for the sin offering. Then Aaron and his sons 
LEV.8.15	and Moses killed it. 
LEV.8.16	Then he took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its offal, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the 
LEV.8.18	Then he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, 
LEV.8.19	and Moses killed it. Then he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. 
LEV.8.20	And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses 
LEV.8.21	Then he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the 
LEV.8.22	And 
LEV.8.23	and Moses killed it. Also he took some of 
LEV.8.24	Then he brought Aaron’s sons. And Moses put some of the 
LEV.8.25	Then he took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh; 
LEV.8.26	and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the 
LEV.8.27	and he put all these 
LEV.8.28	Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar, on the burnt offering. They were consecration offerings for a sweet aroma. That was an offering made by fire to the 
LEV.8.29	And 
LEV.8.30	Then 
LEV.8.31	And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, 
LEV.8.32	What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire. 
LEV.8.33	And you shall not go outside the door of the tabernacle of meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are ended. For 
LEV.8.34	As he has done this day, so the 
LEV.8.35	Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tabernacle of meeting day and night for seven days, and 
LEV.8.36	So Aaron and his sons did all the things that the 
LEV.9.1	It came to pass on the 
LEV.9.2	And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young 
LEV.9.3	And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, 
LEV.9.4	also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before the 
LEV.9.5	So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the 
LEV.9.6	Then Moses said, “This is the thing which the 
LEV.9.7	And Moses said to Aaron, “Go to the altar, 
LEV.9.8	Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
LEV.9.9	Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar. 
LEV.9.10	But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the 
LEV.9.11	The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, 
LEV.9.13	Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	Then he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one. 
LEV.9.16	And he brought the burnt offering and offered it 
LEV.9.17	Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, 
LEV.9.18	He also killed the bull and the ram as 
LEV.9.19	and the fat from the bull and the ram—the fatty tail, what covers the entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver; 
LEV.9.20	and they put the fat on the breasts. 
LEV.9.21	but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved 
LEV.9.22	Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, 
LEV.9.23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	and 
LEV.10.1	Then 
LEV.10.2	So 
LEV.10.3	And Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the 
LEV.10.3	‘By those 
LEV.10.3	I must be regarded as holy;
LEV.10.3	And before all the people
LEV.10.3	I must be glorified.’ ”
LEV.10.3	So Aaron held his peace.
LEV.10.4	Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near, 
LEV.10.5	So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.
LEV.10.6	And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, “Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and 
LEV.10.7	You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die, 
LEV.10.8	Then the 
LEV.10.9	“Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations, 
LEV.10.10	that you may 
LEV.10.11	and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the 
LEV.10.12	And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: 
LEV.10.13	You shall eat it in a 
LEV.10.14	The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your 
LEV.10.15	The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to offer as a wave offering before the 
LEV.10.16	Then Moses made careful inquiry about 
LEV.10.17	“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear 
LEV.10.18	See! 
LEV.10.19	And Aaron said to Moses, “Look, 
LEV.10.20	So when Moses heard that, he was content.
LEV.11.1	Now the 
LEV.11.2	“Speak to the children of Israel, saying,

LEV.25.49	or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him; or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him; or if he is able he may redeem himself. 
LEV.25.50	Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him: The price of his release shall be according to the number of years, from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee; it shall be 
LEV.25.51	If there are still many years remaining, according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought. 
LEV.25.52	And if there remain but a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall reckon with him, and according to his years he shall repay him the price of his redemption. 
LEV.25.53	He shall be with him as a yearly hired servant, and he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight. 
LEV.25.54	And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee—he and his children with him.

NUM.7.89	Now when Moses went into the tabernacle of meeting 
NUM.8.1	And the 
NUM.8.2	“Speak to Aaron, and say to him, ‘When you 
NUM.8.3	And Aaron did so; he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the 
NUM.8.4	Now this workmanship of the lampstand 
NUM.8.5	Then the 
NUM.8.6	“Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them 
NUM.8.7	Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: 
NUM.8.8	Then let them take a young bull with 
NUM.8.9	And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of meeting, 
NUM.8.10	So you shall bring the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the 
NUM.8.13	“And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them 
NUM.8.14	Thus you shall

NUM.8.16	For they 
NUM.8.17	For all the firstborn among the children of Israel 
NUM.8.18	I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel. 
NUM.8.19	And 
NUM.8.20	Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that the 
NUM.8.21	And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them 
NUM.8.22	After that the Levites went in to do their work in the tabernacle of meeting before Aaron and his sons; 
NUM.8.23	Then the 
NUM.8.24	“This 
NUM.8.25	and at the age of fifty years they must cease performing this work, and shall work no more. 
NUM.8.26	They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting,

NUM.9.2	“Let the children of Israel keep 
NUM.9.3	On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time. According to all its rites and ceremonies you shall keep it.” 
NUM.9.4	So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. 
NUM.9.5	And 
NUM.9.6	Now there were 
NUM.9.7	And those men said to him, “We 
NUM.9.8	And Moses said to them, “Stand still, that 
NUM.9.9	Then the 
NUM.9.10	“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If anyone of you or your posterity is unclean because of a corpse, or

NUM.9.16	So it was always: the cloud covered it 
NUM.9.17	Whenever the cloud 
NUM.9.18	At the command of the 
NUM.9.19	Even when the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel 
NUM.9.20	So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a few days: according to the command of the 
NUM.9.21	So it was, when the cloud remained only from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would journey; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would journey. 
NUM.9.23	At the command of the 
NUM.10.1	And the 
NUM.10.2	“Make two silver trumpets for yourself; you shall make them of hammered work; you shall use them for 
NUM.10.3	When 
NUM.10.4	But if they blow 
NUM.10.5	When you sound the 
NUM.10.6	When you sound the advance the second time, then 
NUM.10.7	And when the assembly is to be gathered together, 
NUM.10.8	The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations.
NUM.10.9	“When you go to war in your land against the enemy who 
NUM.10.10	Also 
NUM.10.11	Now it came to pass on the twentieth 
NUM.10.12	And the children of Israel set out from 
NUM.10.13	So they started out for the first time 
NUM.10.14	The standard of the camp of the children of Judah 
NUM.10.15	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar 
NUM.10.16	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun 
NUM.10.17	Then 
NUM.10.18	And 
NUM.10.19	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon 
NUM.10.20	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad 
NUM.10.21	Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the 
NUM.10.22	And 
NUM.10.23	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh 
NUM.10.24	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin 
NUM.10.25	Then 
NUM.10.26	Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher 
NUM.10.27	And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali 
NUM.10.28	Thus 
NUM.10.29	Now Moses said to 
NUM.10.30	And he said to him, “I will not go, but I will depart to my 
NUM.10.31	So 
NUM.10.32	And it shall be, if you go with us—indeed it shall be—that 
NUM.10.33	So they departed from 
NUM.10.34	And 
NUM.10.35	So it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said:
NUM.10.35	“Rise up, O 
NUM.10.35	Let Your enemies be scattered,
NUM.10.35	And let those who hate You flee before You.”
NUM.10.36	And when it rested, he said:
NUM.10.36	“Return, O 
NUM.10.36	 the many thousands of Israel.”
NUM.11.1	Now 
NUM.11.2	Then the people 
NUM.11.3	So he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the 
NUM.11.4	Now the 
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; 
NUM.11.6	but now 
NUM.11.7	Now 
NUM.11.8	The people went about and gathered 
NUM.11.9	And 
NUM.11.10	Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and 
NUM.11.11	So Moses said to the 
NUM.11.12	Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to me, 
NUM.11.13	Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep all over me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden 
NUM.11.15	If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now—if I have found favor in Your sight—and 
NUM.11.16	So the 
NUM.11.17	Then I will come down and talk with you there. 
NUM.11.18	Then you shall say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept 
NUM.11.19	You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but 
NUM.11.21	And Moses said, 
NUM.11.22	Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide enough for them?”
NUM.11.23	And the 
NUM.11.24	So Moses went out and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	Then the 
NUM.11.26	But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one 
NUM.11.27	And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
NUM.11.28	So Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, 
NUM.11.29	Then Moses said to him, “Are you zealous for my sake? 
NUM.11.30	And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
NUM.11.31	Now a 
NUM.11.32	And the people stayed up all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten 
NUM.11.33	But while the 
NUM.11.34	So he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving.
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	Then 
NUM.12.2	So they said, “Has the 
NUM.12.3	(Now the man Moses 
NUM.12.4	Suddenly the 
NUM.12.5	Then the 
NUM.12.6	Then He said,
NUM.12.6	“Hear now My words:
NUM.12.6	If there is a prophet among you,
NUM.12.6	, the 
NUM.12.6	I speak to him 
NUM.12.7	Not so with 
NUM.12.7	He 
NUM.12.8	I speak with him 
NUM.12.8	Even 
NUM.12.8	And he sees 
NUM.12.8	Why then 
NUM.12.8	To speak against My servant Moses?”
NUM.12.9	So the anger of the 
NUM.12.10	And when the cloud departed from above the tabernacle, 
NUM.12.11	So Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord! Please 
NUM.12.12	Please 
NUM.12.13	So Moses cried out to the 
NUM.12.14	Then the 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in 
NUM.12.16	And afterward the people moved from 
NUM.13.1	And the 
NUM.13.2	“Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.”
NUM.13.3	So Moses sent them 
NUM.13.4	Now these 
NUM.13.5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; 
NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, 
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; 
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; 
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; 
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; 
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Joseph, 
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; 
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; 
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; 
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
NUM.13.16	These 
NUM.13.17	Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this 
NUM.13.18	and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it 
NUM.13.19	whether the land they dwell in 
NUM.13.20	whether the land 
NUM.13.21	So they went up and spied out the land 
NUM.13.22	And they went up through the South and came to 
NUM.13.23	Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. 
NUM.13.24	The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there. 
NUM.13.25	And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.
NUM.13.26	Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran, at 
NUM.13.27	Then they told him, and said: “We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with 
NUM.13.28	Nevertheless the 
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.”
NUM.13.30	Then 
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they 
NUM.13.32	And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone as spies 
NUM.13.33	There we saw the giants (
NUM.14.1	So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people 
NUM.14.2	And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	Why has the 
NUM.14.4	So they said to one another, 
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
NUM.14.6	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, 
NUM.14.7	and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: 
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only 
NUM.14.10	And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Now 
NUM.14.11	Then the 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will 
NUM.14.13	And 
NUM.14.14	and they will tell 
NUM.14.15	Now 
NUM.14.16	‘Because the 
NUM.14.17	And now, I pray, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying, 
NUM.14.18	‘The 
NUM.14.19	Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, 
NUM.14.20	Then the 
NUM.14.21	but truly, as I live, 
NUM.14.22	because all these men who have seen My glory and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have put Me to the test now 
NUM.14.23	they certainly shall not 
NUM.14.24	But My servant 
NUM.14.25	Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley; tomorrow turn and 
NUM.14.26	And the 
NUM.14.27	“How long 
NUM.14.28	Say to them, ‘As I live,’ says the 
NUM.14.29	The carcasses of you who have complained against Me shall fall in this wilderness, 
NUM.14.30	Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, you shall by no means enter the land which I swore I would make you dwell in. 
NUM.14.31	But your little ones, whom you said would be victims, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which 
NUM.14.32	But 
NUM.14.33	And your sons shall

NUM.14.35	I the 
NUM.14.36	Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the land, 
NUM.14.37	those very men who brought the evil report about the land, 
NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive, of the men who went to spy out the land.
NUM.14.39	Then Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, 
NUM.14.40	And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, 
NUM.14.41	And Moses said, “Now why do you transgress the command of the 
NUM.14.42	Do not go up, lest you be defeated by your enemies, for the 
NUM.14.43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites 
NUM.14.44	But they presumed to go up to the mountaintop. Nevertheless, neither the ark of the covenant of the 
NUM.14.45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down and attacked them, and drove them back as far as 
NUM.15.1	And the 
NUM.15.2	“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you have come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving to you, 
NUM.15.3	and you 
NUM.15.4	then 
NUM.15.5	and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each 
NUM.15.6	Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths 
NUM.15.7	and as a drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a sweet aroma to the 
NUM.15.8	And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a

NUM.15.12	According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do with everyone according to their number.

NUM.15.15	One ordinance 
NUM.15.16	One law and one custom shall be for you and for the stranger who dwells with you.’ ”
NUM.15.17	Again the 
NUM.15.18	“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the land to which I bring you, 
NUM.15.19	then it will be, when you eat of 
NUM.15.20	You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal

NUM.15.36	So, as the 
NUM.15.37	Again the 
NUM.15.38	“Speak to the children of Israel: Tell

NUM.15.40	and that you may remember and do all My commandments, and be

NUM.16.1	Now 
NUM.16.2	and they rose up before Moses with some of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, 
NUM.16.3	They gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “
NUM.16.4	So when Moses heard 
NUM.16.5	and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, “Tomorrow morning the 
NUM.16.6	Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company; 
NUM.16.7	put fire in them and put incense in them before the 
NUM.16.8	Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi: 
NUM.16.10	and that He has brought you near 
NUM.16.11	Therefore you and all your company 
NUM.16.12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up! 
NUM.16.14	Moreover 
NUM.16.15	Then Moses was very angry, and said to the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said to Korah, “Tomorrow, you and all your company be present 
NUM.16.17	Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the 
NUM.16.18	So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.16.19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then 
NUM.16.20	And the 
NUM.16.21	“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may

NUM.16.23	So the 
NUM.16.24	“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ ”
NUM.16.25	Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 
NUM.16.26	And he spoke to the congregation, saying, 
NUM.16.27	So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little 
NUM.16.28	And Moses said: 
NUM.16.29	If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, 
NUM.16.32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and 
NUM.16.33	So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. 
NUM.16.34	Then all Israel who 
NUM.16.35	And 
NUM.16.36	Then the 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for 
NUM.16.38	The censers of 
NUM.16.39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar, 
NUM.16.41	On the next day 
NUM.16.42	Now it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting; and suddenly 
NUM.16.43	Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.
NUM.16.44	And the 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.”
NUM.16.45	And they fell on their faces.
NUM.16.46	So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense

NUM.16.48	And he stood between the dead and the living; 
NUM.16.49	Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the Korah incident. 
NUM.16.50	So Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
NUM.17.1	And the 
NUM.17.2	“Speak to the children of Israel, and get from them a rod from each father’s house, all their leaders according to their fathers’ houses—twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod. 
NUM.17.3	And you shall write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi. For there shall be one rod for the head of

NUM.17.6	So Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron 
NUM.17.7	And Moses placed the rods before the 
NUM.17.8	Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and behold, the 
NUM.17.9	Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	Thus did Moses; just as the 
NUM.17.12	So the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Surely we die, we perish, we all perish! 
NUM.17.13	Whoever even comes near the tabernacle of the

NUM.18.2	Also bring with you your brethren of the

NUM.18.4	They shall be joined with you and attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting, for all the work of the tabernacle; 
NUM.18.5	And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and 
NUM.18.6	Behold, I Myself have 
NUM.18.7	Therefore 
NUM.18.8	And the 
NUM.18.9	This shall be yours of the most holy things

NUM.18.16	And those redeemed of the devoted things you shall redeem when one month old, 
NUM.18.17	But the firstborn of a cow, the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they 
NUM.18.18	And their flesh shall be yours, just as the

NUM.18.21	“Behold, 
NUM.18.22	Hereafter the children of Israel shall not come near the tabernacle of meeting, 
NUM.18.23	But the Levites shall perform the work of the tabernacle of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; 
NUM.18.24	For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer up 
NUM.18.25	Then the 
NUM.18.26	“Speak thus to the Levites, and say to them: ‘When you take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering of it to the

NUM.19.8	And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water, bathe in water, and shall be unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.9	Then a man 
NUM.19.10	And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. It shall be a statute forever to the children of Israel and to the stranger who dwells among them.
NUM.19.11	‘He who touches the dead body of anyone shall be unclean seven days.

NUM.19.22	Whatever the unclean 
NUM.20.1	Then
NUM.20.2	Now there was no water for the congregation; 
NUM.20.3	And the people 
NUM.20.4	Why have you brought up the assembly of the 
NUM.20.5	And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It 
NUM.20.6	So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and 
NUM.20.7	Then the 
NUM.20.8	“Take the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus 
NUM.20.9	So Moses took the rod 
NUM.20.10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; 
NUM.20.12	Then the 
NUM.20.13	This 
NUM.20.14	Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of 
NUM.20.15	how our fathers went down to Egypt, 
NUM.20.16	When we cried out to the 
NUM.20.17	Please 
NUM.20.18	Then 
NUM.20.19	So the children of Israel said to him, “We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, 
NUM.20.20	Then he said, 
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom 
NUM.20.22	Now the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from 
NUM.20.23	And the 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron shall be

NUM.20.26	and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered 
NUM.20.27	So Moses did just as the 
NUM.20.28	Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and 
NUM.20.29	Now when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron 
NUM.21.1	The 
NUM.21.2	So Israel made a vow to the 
NUM.21.3	And the 
NUM.21.4	Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea, to 
NUM.21.5	And the people 
NUM.21.6	So 
NUM.21.7	Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, “We have 
NUM.21.8	Then the 
NUM.21.9	So 
NUM.21.10	Now the children of Israel moved on and 
NUM.21.11	And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which 
NUM.21.12	From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered. 
NUM.21.13	From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which 
NUM.21.14	Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the 
NUM.21.14	“Waheb in Suphah,
NUM.21.14	The brooks of the Arnon,
NUM.21.15	And the slope of the brooks
NUM.21.15	That reaches to the dwelling of

NUM.21.16	From there 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Spring up, O well!
NUM.21.17	All of you sing to it—
NUM.21.18	The well the leaders sank,
NUM.21.18	Dug by the nation’s nobles,
NUM.21.18	By the 
NUM.21.18	And from the wilderness 
NUM.21.19	from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth, 
NUM.21.21	Then 
NUM.21.22	“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” 
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, 
NUM.21.24	Then 
NUM.21.25	So Israel took all these cities, and Israel 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon 
NUM.21.27	Therefore those who speak in proverbs say:
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon, let it be built;
NUM.21.27	Let the city of Sihon be repaired.
NUM.21.28	“For 
NUM.21.28	A flame from the city of Sihon;
NUM.21.28	It consumed 
NUM.21.28	The lords of the

NUM.21.29	To Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	“But we have shot at them;
NUM.21.30	Heshbon has perished 
NUM.21.30	Then we laid waste as far as Nophah,
NUM.21.30	Which 
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	Then Moses sent to spy out 
NUM.21.33	And they turned and went up by the way to 
NUM.21.34	Then the 
NUM.21.35	So they defeated him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left him; and they took possession of his land.
NUM.22.1	Then 
NUM.22.2	Now 
NUM.22.3	And 
NUM.22.4	So Moab said to 
NUM.22.5	Then 
NUM.22.6	Therefore please come at once, 
NUM.22.7	So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the 
NUM.22.8	And he said to them, 
NUM.22.9	Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who 
NUM.22.10	So Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, 
NUM.22.11	‘Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out.’ ”
NUM.22.12	And God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for 
NUM.22.13	So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, “Go back to your land, for the 
NUM.22.14	And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more honorable than they. 
NUM.22.16	And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me; 
NUM.22.17	for I will certainly 
NUM.22.18	Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, 
NUM.22.19	Now therefore, please, you also 
NUM.22.20	And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men come to call you, rise 
NUM.22.21	So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
NUM.22.22	Then God’s anger was aroused because he went, 
NUM.22.23	Now 
NUM.22.24	Then the Angel of the 
NUM.22.25	And when the donkey saw the Angel of the 
NUM.22.26	Then the Angel of the 
NUM.22.27	And when the donkey saw the Angel of the 
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, 
NUM.22.30	So the donkey said to Balaam, “
NUM.22.30	And he said, “No.”
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	And the Angel of the 
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.”
NUM.22.34	And Balaam said to the Angel of the 
NUM.22.35	Then the Angel of the 
NUM.22.36	Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, 
NUM.22.37	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able 
NUM.22.38	And Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I have come to you! Now, have I any power at all to say anything? 
NUM.22.39	So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	Then Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent 
NUM.22.41	So it was, the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the 
NUM.23.1	Then Balaam said to Balak, 
NUM.23.2	And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam 
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said to Balak, 
NUM.23.4	And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on

NUM.23.6	So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.
NUM.23.7	And he 
NUM.23.7	“Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram,
NUM.23.7	From the mountains of the east.
NUM.23.7	‘Come, curse Jacob for me,

NUM.23.9	Not reckoning itself among the nations.
NUM.23.10	“Who
NUM.23.10	Or number one-fourth of Israel?
NUM.23.10	Let me die 
NUM.23.10	And let my end be like his!”
NUM.23.11	Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? 
NUM.23.12	So he answered and said, 
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, 
NUM.23.15	And he said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet 
NUM.23.16	Then the 
NUM.23.17	So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the

NUM.23.18	“Rise up, Balak, and hear!
NUM.23.18	Listen to me, son of Zippor!

NUM.23.19	Nor a son of man, that He should repent.
NUM.23.19	Has He 
NUM.23.19	Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received

NUM.23.21	Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel.
NUM.23.21	The 
NUM.23.21	And the shout of a King 
NUM.23.22	God brings them out of Egypt;

NUM.23.23	Nor any divination against Israel.
NUM.23.23	It now must be said of Jacob
NUM.23.23	And of Israel, ‘Oh, 
NUM.23.24	Look, a people rises 
NUM.23.24	And lifts itself up like a lion;
NUM.23.24	It shall not lie down until it devours the prey,
NUM.23.24	And drinks the blood of the slain.”
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!”
NUM.23.26	So Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not tell you, saying, 
NUM.23.27	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that 
NUM.23.29	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on 
NUM.24.1	Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel 
NUM.24.3	Then he took up his oracle and said:
NUM.24.3	“The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,
NUM.24.4	The utterance of him who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.4	Who sees the vision of the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	Who 
NUM.24.5	“How lovely are your tents, O Jacob!
NUM.24.5	Your dwellings, O Israel!
NUM.24.6	Like valleys that stretch out,
NUM.24.6	Like gardens by the riverside,
NUM.24.6	Like aloes 
NUM.24.6	Like cedars beside the waters.
NUM.24.7	He shall pour water from his buckets,
NUM.24.7	And his seed 
NUM.24.7	“His king shall be higher than

NUM.24.9	And as a lion, who shall rouse him?’

NUM.24.9	And cursed 
NUM.24.10	Then Balak’s anger was aroused against Balaam, and he 
NUM.24.11	Now therefore, flee to your place. 
NUM.24.12	So Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 
NUM.24.13	‘If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the 
NUM.24.14	And now, indeed, I am going to my people. Come,

NUM.24.18	Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession,
NUM.24.18	While Israel does valiantly.
NUM.24.19	Out of Jacob One shall have dominion,
NUM.24.19	And destroy the remains of the city.”
NUM.24.20	Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his oracle and said:
NUM.24.20	“Amalek 
NUM.24.20	But

NUM.24.21	“Firm is your dwelling place,
NUM.24.21	And your nest is set in the rock;
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless Kain shall be burned.
NUM.24.22	How long until Asshur carries you away captive?”
NUM.24.23	Then he took up his oracle and said:
NUM.24.23	“Alas! Who shall live when God does this?

NUM.31.4	A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.”
NUM.31.5	So there were recruited from the divisions of Israel one thousand from 
NUM.31.6	Then Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from 
NUM.31.7	And they warred against the Midianites, just as the 
NUM.31.8	They killed the kings of Midian with 
NUM.31.9	And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captive, with their little ones, and took as spoil all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their goods. 
NUM.31.10	They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their forts. 
NUM.31.11	And 
NUM.31.12	Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, 
NUM.31.13	And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp. 
NUM.31.14	But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, 
NUM.31.15	And Moses said to them: “Have you kept

NUM.31.52	And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the 
NUM.31.53	(The men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 
NUM.31.54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of meeting 
NUM.32.1	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock; and when they saw the land of 
NUM.32.2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, 
NUM.32.3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, 
NUM.32.4	the country 
NUM.32.5	Therefore they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not take us over the Jordan.”
NUM.32.6	And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: “Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here? 
NUM.32.7	Now why will you

NUM.32.9	For 
NUM.32.10	So the

NUM.32.15	For if you

NUM.32.17	but 
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until every one of the children of Israel has received his inheritance. 
NUM.32.19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, 
NUM.32.20	Then 
NUM.32.21	and all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	and 
NUM.32.23	But if you do not do so, then take note, you have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.”
NUM.32.25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: “Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead; 
NUM.32.27	but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before the

NUM.32.29	And Moses said to them: “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the

NUM.32.31	Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: “As the

DEU.34.6	And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but 
DEU.34.7	Moses 
DEU.34.8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab 
DEU.34.9	Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the 
DEU.34.10	But since then there 
DEU.34.11	in all 
DEU.34.12	and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	After the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. 
JOS.1.3	Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory. 
JOS.1.5	No man shall 
JOS.1.6	Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law 
JOS.1.8	This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but 
JOS.1.9	Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
JOS.1.11	“Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for 
JOS.1.12	And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	So they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only the 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.”
JOS.2.1	Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men 
JOS.2.2	And 
JOS.2.3	So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.”
JOS.2.4	Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they 
JOS.2.5	And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.” 
JOS.2.6	(But 
JOS.2.7	Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
JOS.2.8	Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, 
JOS.2.9	and said to the men: 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	And as soon as we 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, I beg you, 
JOS.2.13	and 
JOS.2.14	So the men answered her, “Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she 
JOS.2.16	And she said to them, “Get to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward you may go your way.”
JOS.2.17	So the men said to her: “We 
JOS.2.18	unless, 
JOS.2.19	So it shall be 
JOS.2.20	And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear.”
JOS.2.21	Then she said, “According to your words, so 
JOS.2.22	They departed and went to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers sought 
JOS.2.23	So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them. 
JOS.2.24	And they said to Joshua, “Truly 
JOS.3.1	Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and they set out 
JOS.3.2	So it was, 
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people, saying, 
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed 
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said to the people, 
JOS.3.6	Then Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, 
JOS.3.6	So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	You shall command 
JOS.3.9	So Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of 
JOS.3.12	Now therefore, 
JOS.3.13	And it shall come to pass, 
JOS.3.14	So it was, when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the 
JOS.3.15	and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and 
JOS.3.16	that the waters which came down from upstream stood 
JOS.3.17	Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed 
JOS.4.2	“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe, 
JOS.4.3	and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where 
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe; 
JOS.4.5	and Joshua said to them: “Cross over before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	that this may be 
JOS.4.7	Then you shall answer them that 
JOS.4.8	And the children of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as the 
JOS.4.9	Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
JOS.4.10	So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the 
JOS.4.11	Then it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the 
JOS.4.12	And 
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	Then the 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests who bear 
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.18	And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth 
JOS.4.20	And 
JOS.4.21	Then he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: 
JOS.4.22	then you shall let your children know, saying, 
JOS.4.23	for the 
JOS.4.24	that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
JOS.5.4	And this 
JOS.5.5	For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	For the children of Israel walked 
JOS.5.7	Then Joshua circumcised 
JOS.5.8	So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp 
JOS.5.9	Then the 
JOS.5.10	Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover 
JOS.5.11	And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and parched grain, on the very same day. 
JOS.5.12	Then 
JOS.5.13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, 
JOS.5.14	So He said, “No, but 
JOS.5.14	And Joshua 
JOS.5.15	Then the Commander of the 
JOS.6.1	Now 
JOS.6.2	And the 
JOS.6.3	You shall march around the city, all 
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear seven 
JOS.6.5	It shall come to pass, when they make a long 
JOS.6.6	Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	And he said to the people, “Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the 
JOS.6.9	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, 
JOS.6.10	Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.” 
JOS.6.11	So he had 
JOS.6.12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, 
JOS.6.13	Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. So they did six days.
JOS.6.15	But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: “Shout, for the 
JOS.6.17	Now the city shall be 
JOS.6.18	And you, 
JOS.6.19	But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted when 
JOS.6.21	And they 
JOS.6.22	But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country, “Go into the harlot’s house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, 
JOS.6.23	And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, 
JOS.6.24	But they burned the city and all that 
JOS.6.25	And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot, her father’s household, and all that she had. So 
JOS.6.26	Then Joshua charged 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the children of Israel committed a 
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which 
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men went up there from the people, 
JOS.7.5	And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them 
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, “Alas, Lord 
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies? 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear 
JOS.7.10	So the 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, 
JOS.7.13	Get up, 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be 
JOS.7.15	Then it shall be 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. 
JOS.7.17	He brought the clan of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. 
JOS.7.18	Then he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, 
JOS.7.19	Now Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I beg you, 
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Indeed 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it. 
JOS.7.23	And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and 
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, 
JOS.7.26	Then they 
JOS.8.1	Now the 
JOS.8.2	And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to 
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night. 
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying: “Behold, 
JOS.8.5	Then I and all the people who 
JOS.8.6	For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will say, ‘
JOS.8.7	Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the 
JOS.8.8	And it will be, when you have taken the city, 
JOS.8.9	Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
JOS.8.10	Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	And all the people of war who 
JOS.8.12	So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
JOS.8.13	And when they had set the people, all the army that 
JOS.8.14	Now it happened, when the king of Ai saw 
JOS.8.15	And Joshua and all Israel 
JOS.8.16	So all the people who 
JOS.8.17	There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	So 
JOS.8.20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven. So they had no power to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
JOS.8.21	Now when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	Then the others came out of the city against them; so they were 
JOS.8.23	But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	So it was 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had 
JOS.8.27	Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of the 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it 
JOS.8.29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. 
JOS.8.30	Now Joshua built an altar to the 
JOS.8.31	as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, 
JOS.8.33	Then all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, 
JOS.8.34	And afterward 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, 
JOS.9.1	And it came to pass when 
JOS.9.2	that they 
JOS.9.3	But when the inhabitants of 
JOS.9.4	they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended, 
JOS.9.5	old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry 
JOS.9.6	And they went to Joshua, 
JOS.9.7	Then the men of Israel said to the 
JOS.9.8	But they said to Joshua, 
JOS.9.8	And Joshua said to them, “Who 
JOS.9.9	So they said to him: 
JOS.9.10	and 
JOS.9.11	Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We 
JOS.9.12	This bread of ours we took hot 
JOS.9.13	And these wineskins which we filled 
JOS.9.14	Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; 
JOS.9.15	So Joshua 
JOS.9.16	And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they 
JOS.9.17	Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities 
JOS.9.18	But the children of Israel did not attack them, 
JOS.9.19	Then all the rulers said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them: We will let them live, lest 
JOS.9.21	And the rulers said to them, “Let them live, but let them be 
JOS.9.22	Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore, you 
JOS.9.24	So they answered Joshua and said, “Because your servants were clearly told that the 
JOS.9.25	And now, here we are, 
JOS.9.26	So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them. 
JOS.9.27	And that day Joshua made them 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem 
JOS.10.2	that they 
JOS.10.3	Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	“Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for 
JOS.10.5	Therefore the five kings of the 
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and 
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.10	So the 
JOS.10.11	And it happened, as they fled before Israel 
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke to the 
JOS.10.12	“Sun, stand still over Gibeon;
JOS.10.12	And Moon, in the Valley of 
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still,
JOS.10.13	And the moon stopped,
JOS.10.13	Till the people had revenge
JOS.10.13	Upon their enemies.
JOS.10.13	 this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go 
JOS.10.14	And there has been 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	And it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”
JOS.10.18	So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them. 
JOS.10.19	And do not stay 
JOS.10.20	Then it happened, while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who escaped entered fortified cities. 
JOS.10.21	And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace.
JOS.10.21	No one moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.” 
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, 
JOS.10.24	So it was, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” And they drew near and 
JOS.10.25	Then Joshua said to them, 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they 
JOS.10.27	So it was at the time of the going down of the sun 
JOS.10.28	On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly 
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to 
JOS.10.30	And the 
JOS.10.31	Then Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.32	And the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.
JOS.10.34	From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.35	They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the people who 
JOS.10.36	So Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to 
JOS.10.37	And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword—its king, all its cities, and all the people who 
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to 
JOS.10.39	And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the people who 
JOS.10.40	So Joshua conquered all the land: the 
JOS.10.41	And Joshua conquered them from 
JOS.10.42	All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, 
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings who 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanites in the east and in the west, the 
JOS.11.4	So they went out, they and all their armies with them, 
JOS.11.5	And when all these kings had met together, they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	But the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they attacked them. 
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	So Joshua did to them as the 
JOS.11.10	Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	And they struck all the people who 
JOS.11.12	So all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, 
JOS.11.13	But 
JOS.11.14	And all the 
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	Thus Joshua took all this land: 
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured 
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except 
JOS.11.20	For 
JOS.11.21	And at that time Joshua came and cut off 
JOS.11.22	None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, 
JOS.12.1	These 
JOS.12.3	and 
JOS.12.5	and reigned over 
JOS.12.6	These Moses the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	And these 
JOS.12.8	in the mountain country, in the lowlands, in the 
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; 
JOS.12.20	the king of 
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in the 
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one—
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that yet remains: 
JOS.13.3	from Sihor, which 
JOS.13.4	from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians 
JOS.13.5	the land of 
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon as far as 
JOS.13.7	Now therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	With the other half-tribe the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, 
JOS.13.9	from Aroer which 
JOS.13.10	all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the children of Ammon; 
JOS.13.11	Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salcah; 
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei, who remained of

JOS.20.5	Then if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, but did not hate him beforehand. 
JOS.20.6	And he shall dwell in that city 
JOS.20.7	So they appointed 
JOS.20.8	And on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho eastward, they assigned 
JOS.20.9	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwelt among them, that whoever killed a person accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood 
JOS.21.1	Then the heads of the fathers’ 
JOS.21.2	And they spoke to them at 
JOS.21.3	So the children of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance, at the commandment of the 
JOS.21.4	Now the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And 
JOS.21.5	The rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	And 
JOS.21.7	The children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	And the children of Israel gave these cities with their common-lands by lot to the Levites, 
JOS.21.9	So they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah and from the tribe of the children of Simeon these cities which are designated by name, 
JOS.21.10	which were for the children of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, 
JOS.21.11	And they gave them Kirjath Arba (
JOS.21.12	But 
JOS.21.13	Thus 
JOS.21.14	Jattir with its common-land,

JOS.21.17	and from the tribe of Benjamin,

JOS.21.20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, the rest of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.21.21	For they gave them 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim with its common-land, and Beth Horon with its common-land: four cities; 
JOS.21.23	and from the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its common-land, Gibbethon with its common-land, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon with its common-land, 
JOS.21.25	and from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with its common-land and Gath Rimmon with its common-land: two cities. 
JOS.21.26	All the ten cities with their common-lands were for the rest of the families of the children of Kohath.

JOS.21.32	and from the tribe of Naphtali,

JOS.21.38	and from the tribe of Gad, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its common-land, 
JOS.21.40	So all the cities for the children of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, were 
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel 
JOS.21.42	Every one of these cities had its common-land surrounding it; thus 
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	The 
JOS.21.45	Not a word failed of any good thing which the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and said to them: “You have kept 
JOS.22.3	You have not left your brethren these many days, up to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the 
JOS.22.4	And now the 
JOS.22.5	But 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua 
JOS.22.7	Now to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, 
JOS.22.8	and spoke to them, saying, “Return with much riches to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. 
JOS.22.9	So the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which 
JOS.22.10	And when they came to the region of the Jordan which 
JOS.22.11	Now the children of Israel 
JOS.22.12	And when the children of Israel heard 
JOS.22.13	Then the children of Israel 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten rulers, one ruler each from the chief house of every tribe of Israel; and 
JOS.22.15	Then they came to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, 
JOS.22.16	“Thus says the whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.17	 the iniquity 
JOS.22.18	but that you must turn away this day from following the 
JOS.22.19	Nevertheless, if the land of your possession 
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.’ ”
JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the divisions of Israel: 
JOS.22.22	“The 
JOS.22.23	If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following the 
JOS.22.24	But in fact we have done it for fear, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your descendants may speak to our descendants, saying, “What have you to do with the 
JOS.22.25	For the 
JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, ‘Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice, 
JOS.22.27	but 
JOS.22.28	Therefore we said that it will be, when they say 
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	Now when Phinehas the priest and the rulers of the congregation, the heads of the divisions of Israel who 
JOS.22.31	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh, “This day we perceive that the 
JOS.22.32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them. 
JOS.22.33	So the thing pleased the children of Israel, and the children of Israel 
JOS.22.34	The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar, 
JOS.23.1	Now it came to pass, a long time after the 
JOS.23.2	And Joshua 
JOS.23.2	“I am old, advanced in age. 
JOS.23.3	You have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	See, 
JOS.23.5	And the 
JOS.23.6	Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, 
JOS.23.7	 lest you 
JOS.23.8	but you shall 
JOS.23.9	For the 
JOS.23.10	One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the 
JOS.23.11	Therefore take careful heed to yourselves, that you love the 
JOS.23.12	Or else, if indeed you do 
JOS.23.13	know for certain that 
JOS.23.14	“Behold, this day 
JOS.23.15	Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which the 
JOS.23.16	When you have transgressed the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to 
JOS.24.2	And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the 
JOS.24.3	Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and 
JOS.24.4	To Isaac I gave 
JOS.24.5	Also I sent Moses and Aaron, and 
JOS.24.6	‘Then I 
JOS.24.7	So they cried out to the 
JOS.24.8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, 
JOS.24.9	Then 
JOS.24.10	But I would not listen to Balaam; 
JOS.24.11	Then 
JOS.24.12	I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you, 
JOS.24.13	I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and 
JOS.24.14	“Now therefore, fear the 
JOS.24.15	And if it seems evil to you to serve the 
JOS.24.16	So the people answered and said: “Far be it from us that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	for the 
JOS.24.18	And the 
JOS.24.19	But Joshua said to the people, 
JOS.24.20	If you forsake the 
JOS.24.21	And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	So Joshua said to the people, “You 
JOS.24.22	And they said, “
JOS.24.23	“Now therefore,” 
JOS.24.24	And the people 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua 
JOS.24.26	Then Joshua 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be 
JOS.24.28	So 
JOS.24.29	Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at 
JOS.24.31	Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground 
JOS.24.33	And 
JDG.1.1	Now after the 
JDG.1.2	And the 
JDG.1.3	So Judah said to 
JDG.1.4	Then Judah went up, and the 
JDG.1.5	And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
JDG.1.7	And Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather 
JDG.1.8	Now 
JDG.1.9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the South, and in the lowland. 
JDG.1.10	Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in 
JDG.1.11	From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir 
JDG.1.12	Then Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.” 
JDG.1.13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, 
JDG.1.14	Now it happened, when she came 
JDG.1.15	So she said to him, 
JDG.1.15	And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JDG.1.16	Now the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up 
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called 
JDG.1.18	Also Judah took 
JDG.1.19	So the 
JDG.1.20	And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he expelled from there the 
JDG.1.21	But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
JDG.1.22	And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, 
JDG.1.23	So the house of Joseph 
JDG.1.24	And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city, and 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. 
JDG.1.26	And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which 
JDG.1.27	However, Manasseh did not drive out 
JDG.1.28	And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out.
JDG.1.29	Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
JDG.1.30	Nor did 
JDG.1.31	Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	So the Asherites 
JDG.1.33	Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them.
JDG.1.34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; 
JDG.1.35	and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, 
JDG.1.36	Now the boundary of the Amorites 
JDG.2.1	Then the Angel of the 
JDG.2.2	And 
JDG.2.3	Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be 
JDG.2.4	So it was, when the Angel of the 
JDG.2.5	Then they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the 
JDG.2.6	And when 
JDG.2.7	So the people served the 
JDG.2.8	Now 
JDG.2.9	And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at 
JDG.2.10	When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who 
JDG.2.11	Then the children of Israel did 
JDG.2.12	and they 
JDG.2.13	They forsook the 
JDG.2.14	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.15	Wherever they went out, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	Nevertheless, 
JDG.2.17	Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they 
JDG.2.18	And when the 
JDG.2.19	And it came to pass, 
JDG.2.20	Then the anger of the 
JDG.2.21	I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua 
JDG.2.22	so 
JDG.2.23	Therefore the 
JDG.3.1	Now these 
JDG.3.2	(
JDG.3.4	And they were 
JDG.3.5	Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	And 
JDG.3.7	So the children of Israel did 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	When the children of Israel 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.13	Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and 
JDG.3.14	So the children of Israel 
JDG.3.15	But when the children of Israel 
JDG.3.16	Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh. 
JDG.3.17	So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon 
JDG.3.18	And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. 
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned back 
JDG.3.19	He said, “Keep silence!” And all who attended him went out from him.
JDG.3.20	So Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he arose from 
JDG.3.21	Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. 
JDG.3.22	Even the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
JDG.3.24	When he had gone out, 
JDG.3.25	So they waited till they were 
JDG.3.26	But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	And it happened, when he arrived, that 
JDG.3.28	Then he said to them, “Follow 
JDG.3.29	And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And 
JDG.3.31	After him was 
JDG.4.1	When Ehud was dead, 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	And the children of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
JDG.4.6	Then she sent and called for 
JDG.4.7	and against you 
JDG.4.8	And Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!”
JDG.4.9	So she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for the 
JDG.4.10	And Barak called 
JDG.4.11	Now Heber 
JDG.4.12	And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who 
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was 
JDG.4.17	However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of 
JDG.4.18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.” And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.
JDG.4.19	Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened 
JDG.4.20	And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ”
JDG.4.21	Then Jael, Heber’s wife, 
JDG.4.22	And then, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you seek.” And when he went into her 
JDG.4.23	So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel. 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam 
JDG.5.2	“When leaders

JDG.6.2	and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, 
JDG.6.3	So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the 
JDG.6.4	Then they would encamp against them and 
JDG.6.5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it. 
JDG.6.6	So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel 
JDG.6.7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.6.8	that the

JDG.6.19	So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought

JDG.6.29	So they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And when they had inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.” 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that

JDG.6.37	look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and 
JDG.6.38	And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, 
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.

JDG.7.2	And the 
JDG.7.3	Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying,

JDG.8.15	Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you

JDG.9.26	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
JDG.9.27	So they went out into the fields, and gathered 
JDG.9.28	Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, 
JDG.9.29	If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.” So he said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”
JDG.9.30	When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused. 
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, “Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who 
JDG.9.33	And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, 
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all the people who 
JDG.9.35	When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who 
JDG.9.36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!”
JDG.9.36	But Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as 
JDG.9.37	So Gaal spoke again and said, “See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the Diviners’ Terebinth Tree.”
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Where indeed 
JDG.9.39	So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the 
JDG.9.41	Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech. 
JDG.9.43	So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and attacked them. 
JDG.9.44	Then Abimelech and the company that 
JDG.9.45	So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; 
JDG.9.46	Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard 
JDG.9.47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
JDG.9.48	Then Abimelech went up to Mount 
JDG.9.49	So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put 
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women—all the people of the city—fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	But a certain woman 
JDG.9.54	Then 
JDG.9.55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place.
JDG.9.56	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came 
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech there 
JDG.10.2	He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	Now he had thirty sons who 
JDG.10.5	And Jair died and was buried in Camon.
JDG.10.6	Then 
JDG.10.7	So the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	From that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years—all the children of Israel who 
JDG.10.9	Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.
JDG.10.10	And the children of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.10.11	So the 
JDG.10.12	Also 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more. 
JDG.10.14	“Go and 
JDG.10.15	And the children of Israel said to the 
JDG.10.16	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in 
JDG.10.18	And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who 
JDG.11.1	Now 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife bore sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of 
JDG.11.4	It came to pass after a time that the 
JDG.11.5	And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	Then they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.”
JDG.11.7	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, 
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have 
JDG.11.9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him 
JDG.11.12	Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, 
JDG.11.13	And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, 
JDG.11.14	So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, 
JDG.11.15	and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: 
JDG.11.16	for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and 
JDG.11.17	Then 
JDG.11.18	And they 
JDG.11.19	Then 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.21	And the 
JDG.11.22	They took possession of 
JDG.11.23	‘And now the 
JDG.11.24	Will you not possess whatever 
JDG.11.25	And now, 
JDG.11.26	While Israel dwelt in 
JDG.11.27	Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you wronged me by fighting against me. May the 
JDG.11.28	However, the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him.
JDG.11.29	Then 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah 
JDG.11.31	then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them, and the 
JDG.11.33	And he defeated them from Aroer as far as 
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah came to his house at 
JDG.11.35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he 
JDG.11.36	So she said to him, “My father, 
JDG.11.37	Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I.”
JDG.11.38	So he said, “Go.” And he sent her away 
JDG.11.39	And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he 
JDG.11.39	And it became a custom in Israel 
JDG.11.40	 the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
JDG.12.1	Then 
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands. 
JDG.12.3	So when I saw that you would not deliver 
JDG.12.4	Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites 
JDG.12.5	The Gileadites seized the 
JDG.12.6	then they would say to him, “Then say, 
JDG.12.7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in among the cities of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons. And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage, and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons. He judged Israel seven years. 
JDG.12.10	Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, 
JDG.13.1	Again the children of Israel 
JDG.13.2	Now there was a certain man from 
JDG.13.3	And the 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore, please be careful 
JDG.13.5	For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no 
JDG.13.6	So the woman came and told her husband, saying, 
JDG.13.7	And He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or 
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed to the 
JDG.13.9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband 
JDG.13.10	Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the Man who came to me the 
JDG.13.11	So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, “Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?”
JDG.13.11	And He said, “I 
JDG.13.12	Manoah said, “Now let Your words come 
JDG.13.13	So the Angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, 
JDG.13.15	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the 
JDG.13.16	And the Angel of the 
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the 
JDG.13.18	And the Angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, 
JDG.13.20	it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar—the Angel of the 
JDG.13.21	When the Angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Manoah said to his wife, 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If the

JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	Now Samson went down 
JDG.14.2	So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, 
JDG.14.3	Then his father and mother said to him, “
JDG.14.3	And Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”
JDG.14.4	But his father and mother did not know that it was 
JDG.14.5	So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah.
JDG.14.5	Now 
JDG.14.6	And 
JDG.14.7	Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 
JDG.14.8	After some time, when he returned to get her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey 
JDG.14.9	He took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. When he came to his father and mother, he gave 
JDG.14.10	So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men used to do so. 
JDG.14.11	And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
JDG.14.12	Then Samson said to them, “Let me 
JDG.14.13	But if you cannot explain 
JDG.14.13	And they said to him, 
JDG.14.14	So he said to them:
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater came something to eat,
JDG.14.14	And out of the strong came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	Now for three days they could not explain the riddle.
JDG.14.15	But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson’s wife, 
JDG.14.16	Then Samson’s wife wept on him, and said, 
JDG.14.16	And he said to her, “Look, I have not explained 
JDG.14.17	Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people. 
JDG.14.18	So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down:
JDG.14.18	“What 
JDG.14.18	And what 
JDG.14.18	And he said to them:
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	You would not have solved my riddle!”
JDG.14.19	Then 
JDG.14.20	And Samson’s wife 
JDG.15.1	After a while, in the time of wheat harvest, it happened that Samson visited his wife with a 
JDG.15.2	Her father said, “I really thought that you thoroughly 
JDG.15.3	And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!” 
JDG.15.4	Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned 
JDG.15.5	When he had set the torches on fire, he let 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?”
JDG.15.6	And they answered, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” 
JDG.15.7	Samson said to them, “Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.” 
JDG.15.8	So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of 
JDG.15.9	Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves 
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?”
JDG.15.10	So they answered, “We have come up to arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines 
JDG.15.11	And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”
JDG.15.12	But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	Then Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	So they spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.” And they bound him with two 
JDG.15.14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then 
JDG.15.15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and 
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said:
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of a donkey,
JDG.15.16	Heaps upon heaps,
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey
JDG.15.16	I have slain a thousand men!”
JDG.15.17	And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi.
JDG.15.18	Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the 
JDG.15.19	So God split the hollow place that 
JDG.15.20	And 
JDG.16.1	Now Samson went to 
JDG.16.2	 the Gazites 
JDG.16.3	And Samson lay 
JDG.16.4	Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name 
JDG.16.5	And the 
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength 
JDG.16.7	And Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any 
JDG.16.8	So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now 
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me what you may be bound with.”
JDG.16.11	So he said to her, “If they bind me securely with 
JDG.16.12	Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines 
JDG.16.13	Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me what you may be bound with.”
JDG.16.13	And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom”—
JDG.16.14	So she wove 
JDG.16.15	Then she said to him, 
JDG.16.16	And it came to pass, when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him, 
JDG.16.17	that he 
JDG.16.18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart.” So the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand. 
JDG.16.19	Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. 
JDG.16.20	And she said, “The Philistines 
JDG.16.21	Then the Philistines took him and put out his 
JDG.16.22	However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven.
JDG.16.23	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to 
JDG.16.23	“Our god has delivered into our hands
JDG.16.23	Samson our enemy!”
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they 
JDG.16.24	“Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy,
JDG.16.24	The destroyer of our land,
JDG.16.24	And the one who multiplied our dead.”
JDG.16.25	So it happened, when their hearts were 
JDG.16.26	Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars which support the temple, so that I can lean on them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the temple was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines 
JDG.16.28	Then Samson called to the 
JDG.16.29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple, and he braced himself against them, one on his right and the other on his left. 
JDG.16.30	Then Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he pushed with 
JDG.16.31	And his brothers and all his father’s household came down and took him, and brought 
JDG.17.1	Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name 
JDG.17.2	And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred 
JDG.17.2	And his mother said, 
JDG.17.3	So when he had returned the eleven hundred 
JDG.17.4	Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother 
JDG.17.5	The man Micah had a 
JDG.17.6	In those days 
JDG.17.7	Now there was a young man from 
JDG.17.8	The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find 
JDG.17.9	And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?”
JDG.17.9	So he said to him, “I 
JDG.17.10	Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, 
JDG.17.11	Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him. 
JDG.17.12	So Micah 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the 
JDG.18.1	In 
JDG.18.2	So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory, men of valor from 
JDG.18.3	While they 
JDG.18.4	He said to them, “Thus and so Micah did for me. He has 
JDG.18.5	So they said to him, “Please 
JDG.18.6	And the priest said to them, 
JDG.18.7	So the five men departed and went to 
JDG.18.8	Then 
JDG.18.9	So they said, 
JDG.18.10	When you go, you will come to a 
JDG.18.11	And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there, from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.12	Then they went up and encamped in 
JDG.18.13	And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim, and came to 
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren, “Do you know that 
JDG.18.15	So they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man—to the house of Micah—and greeted him. 
JDG.18.16	The 
JDG.18.17	Then 
JDG.18.18	When these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	And they said to him, “Be quiet, 
JDG.18.20	So the priest’s heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and took his place among the people.
JDG.18.21	Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them. 
JDG.18.22	When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who 
JDG.18.23	And they called out to the children of Dan. So they turned around and said to Micah, 
JDG.18.24	So he said, “You have 
JDG.18.25	And the children of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household!” 
JDG.18.26	Then the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they 
JDG.18.27	So they took 
JDG.18.29	And 
JDG.18.30	Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan 
JDG.18.31	So they set up for themselves Micah’s carved image which he made, 
JDG.19.1	And it came to pass in those days, 
JDG.19.2	But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months. 
JDG.19.3	Then her husband arose and went after her, to 
JDG.19.4	Now his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.
JDG.19.5	Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he stood to depart; but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, 
JDG.19.6	So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.” 
JDG.19.7	And when the man stood to depart, his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again. 
JDG.19.8	Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.
JDG.19.9	And when the man stood to depart—he and his concubine and his servant—his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. See, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry. Tomorrow go your way early, so that you may get home.”
JDG.19.10	However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose and departed, and came opposite 
JDG.19.11	They 
JDG.19.12	But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who 
JDG.19.13	So he said to his servant, “Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Gibeah or in 
JDG.19.14	And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no one would 
JDG.19.16	Just then an old man came in from 
JDG.19.17	And when he raised his eyes, he saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”
JDG.19.18	So he said to him, “We 
JDG.19.19	although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your female servant, and for the young man 
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. 
JDG.19.22	As they were 
JDG.19.23	But 
JDG.19.24	Look, 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought 
JDG.19.26	Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master 
JDG.19.27	When her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, there was his concubine, fallen 
JDG.19.28	And he said to her, “Get up and let us be going.” But 
JDG.19.29	When he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and 
JDG.19.30	And so it was that all who saw it said, “No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, 
JDG.20.1	So 
JDG.20.2	And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers 
JDG.20.3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.)
JDG.20.3	Then the children of Israel said, “Tell 
JDG.20.4	So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “My concubine and 
JDG.20.5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, 
JDG.20.6	So 
JDG.20.7	Look! All of you 
JDG.20.8	So all the people arose as one man, saying, “None 
JDG.20.9	but now this 
JDG.20.10	We will take ten men out of 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man.
JDG.20.12	Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore, deliver up the men, 
JDG.20.14	Instead, the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the children of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	And from their cities at that time 
JDG.20.16	Among all this people 
JDG.20.17	Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these 
JDG.20.18	Then the children of Israel arose and 
JDG.20.18	The 
JDG.20.19	So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	Then 
JDG.20.22	And the people, that is, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day. 
JDG.20.23	Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.23	And the 
JDG.20.24	So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day. 
JDG.20.25	And 
JDG.20.26	Then all the children of Israel, that is, all the people, 
JDG.20.27	So the children of Israel inquired of the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, 
JDG.20.28	And the 
JDG.20.29	Then Israel 
JDG.20.30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times. 
JDG.20.31	So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, 
JDG.20.32	And the children of Benjamin said, “They 
JDG.20.32	But the children of Israel said, “Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.” 
JDG.20.33	So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israel’s men in ambush burst forth from their position in the plain of Geba. 
JDG.20.34	And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. 
JDG.20.35	The 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. 
JDG.20.37	And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of 
JDG.20.39	whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike 
JDG.20.40	But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites 
JDG.20.41	And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin panicked, for they saw that disaster had come upon them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, 
JDG.20.44	And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these 
JDG.20.45	Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of 
JDG.20.46	So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months. 
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword—from 
JDG.21.1	Now 
JDG.21.2	Then the people came 
JDG.21.3	and said, “O 
JDG.21.4	So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and 
JDG.21.5	The children of Israel said, “Who 
JDG.21.6	And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel today. 
JDG.21.7	What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, “What one 
JDG.21.9	For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead 
JDG.21.10	So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, 
JDG.21.11	And this 
JDG.21.12	So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at 
JDG.21.13	Then the whole congregation sent 
JDG.21.14	So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.
JDG.21.15	And the people 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” 
JDG.21.17	And they said, “
JDG.21.18	However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, 
JDG.21.19	Then they said, “In fact, 
JDG.21.20	Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out 
JDG.21.22	Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, ‘Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for 
JDG.21.23	And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they 
JDG.21.24	So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days 
RUT.1.1	Now it came to pass, in the days when 
RUT.1.2	The name of the man 
RUT.1.3	Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one 
RUT.1.5	Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the 
RUT.1.7	Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, 
RUT.1.9	The 
RUT.1.9	So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. 
RUT.1.10	And they said to her, “Surely we will return with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? 
RUT.1.12	Turn back, my daughters, go—for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, 
RUT.1.13	would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that 
RUT.1.14	Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth 
RUT.1.15	And she said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to 
RUT.1.16	But Ruth said:
RUT.1.16	“Entreat me not to leave you,
RUT.1.16	For wherever you go, I will go;
RUT.1.16	And wherever you lodge, I will lodge;
RUT.1.16	Your people 
RUT.1.16	And your God, my God.
RUT.1.17	Where you die, I will die,
RUT.1.17	And there will I be buried.
RUT.1.17	The 
RUT.1.17	If 
RUT.1.18	When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.
RUT.1.19	Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that 
RUT.1.20	But she said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. 
RUT.1.21	I went out full, 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem 
RUT.2.1	There was a 
RUT.2.2	So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the

RUT.2.3	Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field 
RUT.2.4	Now behold, Boaz came from 
RUT.2.4	And they answered him, “The

RUT.2.6	So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, “It 
RUT.2.7	And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women.

RUT.2.14	Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, “Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched 
RUT.2.15	And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. 
RUT.2.16	Also let

RUT.2.18	Then she took 
RUT.2.18	So she brought out and gave to her 
RUT.2.19	And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who 
RUT.2.19	So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The man’s name with whom I worked today 
RUT.2.20	Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, 
RUT.2.21	Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”
RUT.2.22	And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “
RUT.2.23	So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, 
RUT.3.2	Now Boaz, 
RUT.3.3	Therefore wash yourself and 
RUT.3.4	Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.”
RUT.3.5	And she said to her, “All that you say to me I will do.”
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her. 
RUT.3.7	And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and 
RUT.3.8	Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and there, a woman was lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	And he said, “Who

RUT.3.13	Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be

RUT.3.15	Also he said, “Bring the shawl that 
RUT.3.16	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “
RUT.3.16	Then she told her all that the man had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	And she said, “These six

RUT.4.1	Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold,

RUT.4.4	And I thought to inform you, saying, 
RUT.4.4	And he said, “I will redeem 
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy

RUT.4.7	Now this 
RUT.4.8	Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy

RUT.4.17	Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi.” And they called his name Obed. He

RUT.4.19	Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab;

1SA.1.6	And her rival also 
1SA.1.7	So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the 
1SA.1.8	Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? 
1SA.1.9	So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of

1SA.1.12	And it happened, as she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. 
1SA.1.14	So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!”
1SA.1.15	But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I

1SA.1.18	And she said, 
1SA.1.19	Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the

1SA.1.23	So 
1SA.1.24	Now when she had weaned him, she 
1SA.1.25	Then they slaughtered a bull, and 
1SA.1.26	And she said, “O my lord! 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed, and the

1SA.2.13	And the priests’ custom with the people 
1SA.2.14	Then he would thrust 
1SA.2.15	Also, before they 
1SA.2.16	And 
1SA.2.17	Therefore the sin of the young men was very great 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother used to make him a little robe, and bring 
1SA.2.20	And Eli 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with 
1SA.2.23	So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people. 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons! For 
1SA.2.25	If one man sins against another,

1SA.2.35	Then 
1SA.2.36	And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come

1SA.3.2	And it came to pass at that time, while Eli 
1SA.3.3	and before 
1SA.3.4	that the 
1SA.3.5	So he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”
1SA.3.5	And he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” And he went and lay down.
1SA.3.6	Then the 
1SA.3.6	So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” He answered, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” 
1SA.3.7	(Now Samuel

1SA.4.7	So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp!” And they said, 
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These 
1SA.4.9	Be strong and conduct yourselves like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, 
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought, and 
1SA.4.11	Also 
1SA.4.12	Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and 
1SA.4.13	Now when he came, there was Eli, sitting on 
1SA.4.14	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What 
1SA.4.15	Eli was ninety-eight years old, and 
1SA.4.16	Then the man said to Eli, “I

1SA.4.17	So the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.4.18	Then it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was with child, 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death 
1SA.4.21	Then she named the child 
1SA.4.22	And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.5.1	Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it 
1SA.5.2	When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of

1SA.5.4	And when they arose early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the

1SA.5.6	But the 
1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod saw how

1SA.5.9	So it was, after they had carried it away, that 
1SA.5.10	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!” 
1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 
1SA.5.12	And the men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the 
1SA.6.1	Now the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines 
1SA.6.3	So they said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it

1SA.6.4	They answered, 
1SA.6.5	Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that 
1SA.6.6	Why then do you harden your hearts 
1SA.6.7	Now therefore, make 
1SA.6.8	Then take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to 
1SA.6.10	Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	And they set the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, 
1SA.6.13	Now 
1SA.6.14	Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone 
1SA.6.15	The Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	So when 
1SA.6.17	These 
1SA.6.18	and the golden rats, 
1SA.6.19	Then 
1SA.6.20	And the men of Beth Shemesh said, 
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of 
1SA.7.1	Then the men of 
1SA.7.2	So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you 
1SA.7.4	So the children of Israel put away the 
1SA.7.5	And Samuel said, 
1SA.7.6	So they gathered together at Mizpah, 
1SA.7.7	Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard 
1SA.7.8	So the children of Israel said to Samuel, 
1SA.7.9	And Samuel took a 
1SA.7.10	Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car. 
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they 
1SA.7.14	Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	And Samuel 
1SA.7.16	He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	But 
1SA.8.1	Now it came to pass when Samuel was 
1SA.8.2	The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; 
1SA.8.3	But his sons 
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, 
1SA.8.5	and said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now 
1SA.8.6	But the thing 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day—with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also. 
1SA.8.9	Now therefore, heed their voice. However, you shall solemnly forewarn them, and 
1SA.8.10	So Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	And he said, 
1SA.8.12	He will 
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters 
1SA.8.14	And 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants. 
1SA.8.16	And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put 
1SA.8.17	He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants. 
1SA.8.18	And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the 
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless the people 
1SA.8.20	that we also may be 
1SA.8.21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of the 
1SA.8.22	So the 
1SA.8.22	And Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Every man go to his city.”
1SA.9.1	There was a man of Benjamin whose name 
1SA.9.2	And he had a choice and handsome son whose name 
1SA.9.3	Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of 
1SA.9.5	When they had come to the land of 
1SA.9.6	And he said to him, “Look now, 
1SA.9.7	Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, 
1SA.9.8	And the servant answered Saul again and said, “Look, I have here at hand one-fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give 
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, when a man 
1SA.9.10	Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God 
1SA.9.11	As they went up the hill to the city, 
1SA.9.12	And they answered them and said, “Yes, there he is, just ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he came to this city, because 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for about this time you will find him.” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, there was Samuel, coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	“Tomorrow about this time 
1SA.9.17	So when Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me, where 
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul and said, “I 
1SA.9.20	But as for 
1SA.9.21	And Saul answered and said, 
1SA.9.22	Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited; there 
1SA.9.23	And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it apart.’ ” 
1SA.9.24	So the cook took up 
1SA.9.25	When they had come down from the high place into the city, 
1SA.9.26	They arose early; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house, saying, “Get up, that I may send you on your way.” And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel.
1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” And he went on. “But you stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the word of God.”
1SA.10.1	Then 
1SA.10.2	When you have departed from me today, you will find two men by 
1SA.10.3	Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor. There three men going up 
1SA.10.4	And they will greet you and give you two 
1SA.10.5	After that you shall come to the hill of God 
1SA.10.6	Then 
1SA.10.7	And let it be, when these 
1SA.10.8	You shall go down before me 
1SA.10.9	So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. 
1SA.10.10	When they came there to the hill, there was 
1SA.10.11	And it happened, when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What 
1SA.10.12	Then a man from there answered and said, “But 
1SA.10.13	And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
1SA.10.14	Then Saul’s 
1SA.10.14	So he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that 
1SA.10.15	And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me, please, what Samuel said to you.”
1SA.10.16	So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been 
1SA.10.17	Then Samuel called the people together 
1SA.10.18	and said to the children of Israel, 
1SA.10.19	But you have today rejected your God, who Himself saved you from all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us!’ Now therefore, present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	And when Samuel had 
1SA.10.21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was chosen. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they sought him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	Therefore they 
1SA.10.22	And the 
1SA.10.23	So they ran and brought him from there; and when he stood among the people, 
1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him 
1SA.10.24	So all the people shouted and said, 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel explained to the people 
1SA.10.26	And Saul also went home 
1SA.10.27	But some 
1SA.11.1	Then 
1SA.11.2	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, “On this 
1SA.11.3	Then the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Hold off for seven days, that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel. And then, if 
1SA.11.4	So the messengers came 
1SA.11.5	Now there was Saul, coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, “What 
1SA.11.6	Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news, and his anger was greatly aroused. 
1SA.11.7	So he took a yoke of oxen and 
1SA.11.7	And the fear of the 
1SA.11.8	When he numbered them in 
1SA.11.9	And they said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by 
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever seems good to you.”
1SA.11.11	So it was, on the next day, that 
1SA.11.12	Then the people said to Samuel, 
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king 
1SA.12.1	Now Samuel said to all Israel: “Indeed I have heeded 
1SA.12.2	And now here is the king, 
1SA.12.3	Here I am. Witness against me before the 
1SA.12.4	And they said, 
1SA.12.5	Then he said to them, “The 
1SA.12.5	And they answered, “
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, 
1SA.12.7	Now therefore, stand still, that I may 
1SA.12.8	When Jacob had gone into Egypt, and your fathers 
1SA.12.9	And when they 
1SA.12.10	Then they cried out to the 
1SA.12.11	And the 
1SA.12.12	And when you saw that 
1SA.12.13	“Now therefore, 
1SA.12.14	If you 
1SA.12.15	However, if you do 
1SA.12.16	“Now therefore, 
1SA.12.17	 today not the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called to the 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said to Samuel, 
1SA.12.20	Then Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have done all this wickedness; 
1SA.12.21	And 
1SA.12.22	For 
1SA.12.23	Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if you still do wickedly, 
1SA.13.1	Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, 
1SA.13.2	Saul chose for himself three thousand 
1SA.13.3	And Jonathan attacked 
1SA.13.4	Now all Israel heard it said 
1SA.13.5	Then the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger (for the people were distressed), then the people 
1SA.13.7	And 
1SA.13.7	As for Saul, he 
1SA.13.8	Then he waited seven days, according to the time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. 
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me.” And he offered the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	Now it happened, as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.
1SA.13.11	And Samuel said, “What have you done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattered from me, and 
1SA.13.12	then I said, ‘The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the 
1SA.13.13	And Samuel said to Saul, 
1SA.13.14	But now your kingdom shall not continue. 
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people present with him, 
1SA.13.16	Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people present with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned onto the road to 
1SA.13.18	another company turned to the road 
1SA.13.19	Now 
1SA.13.20	But all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man’s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle; 
1SA.13.21	and the charge for a sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads. 
1SA.13.22	So it came about, on the day of battle, that 
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison that 
1SA.14.2	And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of 
1SA.14.3	Ahijah the son of Ahitub, 
1SA.14.4	Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over 
1SA.14.5	The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah.
1SA.14.6	Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these 
1SA.14.7	So his armorbearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go then; here I am with you, according to your heart.”
1SA.14.8	Then Jonathan said, “Very well, let us cross over to 
1SA.14.9	If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up. For the 
1SA.14.11	So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have 
1SA.14.12	Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.”
1SA.14.12	Jonathan said to his armorbearer, “Come up after me, for the 
1SA.14.13	And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer after him; and they 
1SA.14.14	That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about half an acre of land.
1SA.14.15	And 
1SA.14.16	Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and 
1SA.14.17	Then Saul said to the people who 
1SA.14.18	And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here” (for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel). 
1SA.14.19	Now it happened, while Saul 
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all the people who 
1SA.14.21	Moreover the Hebrews 
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel who 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had 
1SA.14.25	Now all 
1SA.14.26	And when the people had come into the woods, there was the honey, dripping; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that 
1SA.14.28	Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed 
1SA.14.29	But Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Look now, how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?”
1SA.14.31	Now they had driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. So the people were very faint. 
1SA.14.32	And the people rushed on the spoil, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered 
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, saying, “Look, the people are sinning against the 
1SA.14.33	So he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this day.” 
1SA.14.34	Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, ‘Bring me here every man’s ox and every man’s sheep, slaughter 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul 
1SA.14.36	Now Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them.”
1SA.14.36	And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.”
1SA.14.36	Then the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”
1SA.14.37	So Saul 
1SA.14.38	And Saul said, 
1SA.14.39	For 
1SA.14.40	Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side.”
1SA.14.40	And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”
1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul said to the 
1SA.14.42	And Saul said, “Cast 
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, 
1SA.14.43	And Jonathan told him, and said, 
1SA.14.44	Saul answered, 
1SA.14.45	But the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Certainly not! 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the people of 
1SA.14.48	And he gathered an army and 
1SA.14.49	The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife 
1SA.14.51	Kish 
1SA.14.52	Now there was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, 
1SA.15.1	Samuel also said to Saul, 
1SA.15.2	Thus says the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and 
1SA.15.4	So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.
1SA.15.6	Then Saul said to 
1SA.15.7	And Saul attacked the Amalekites, from 
1SA.15.8	He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people 
1SA.15.10	Now the word of the 
1SA.15.11	“I greatly regret that I have set up Saul 
1SA.15.12	So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul went to 
1SA.15.13	Then Samuel went to Saul, and Saul said to him, 
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “What then 
1SA.15.15	And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Be quiet! And I will tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	And he said to him, “Speak on.”
1SA.15.17	So Samuel said, 
1SA.15.18	Now the 
1SA.15.19	Why then did you not obey the voice of the 
1SA.15.20	And Saul said to Samuel, 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	So Samuel said:
1SA.15.22	“Has the 
1SA.15.22	As in obeying the voice of the 
1SA.15.22	Behold, 
1SA.15.22	 to heed than the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	For rebellion 
1SA.15.23	And stubbornness 
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.23	He also has rejected you from 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, 
1SA.15.27	And as Samuel turned around to go away, 
1SA.15.28	So Samuel said to him, 
1SA.15.29	And also the Strength of Israel 
1SA.15.30	Then he said, “I have sinned; 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me.” So Agag came to him cautiously.
1SA.15.32	And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
1SA.15.33	But Samuel said, 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to 
1SA.15.35	And 
1SA.16.1	Now the 
1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears 
1SA.16.2	But the 
1SA.16.3	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.”
1SA.16.4	So Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	So it was, when they came, that he looked at 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the 
1SA.16.10	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” Then he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.” 
1SA.16.12	So he sent and brought him in. Now he 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and 
1SA.16.14	But the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	And Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our master now command your servants, 
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring 
1SA.16.18	Then one of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, 
1SA.16.19	Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David, who 
1SA.16.20	And Jesse 
1SA.16.21	So David came to Saul and 
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.” 
1SA.16.23	And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play 
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle, and were gathered at 
1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
1SA.17.4	And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named 
1SA.17.6	And 
1SA.17.7	Now the staff of his spear 
1SA.17.8	Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up for battle? 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and 
1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David 
1SA.17.13	The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the battle. The 
1SA.17.14	David 
1SA.17.15	But David occasionally went and returned from Saul 
1SA.17.16	And the Philistine drew near and presented himself forty days, morning and evening.
1SA.17.17	Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried 
1SA.17.18	And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of 
1SA.17.19	Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel 
1SA.17.20	So David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took 
1SA.17.21	For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	Then as he talked with them, there was the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, coming up from the armies of the Philistines; and he spoke 
1SA.17.24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid. 
1SA.17.25	So the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be 
1SA.17.26	Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away 
1SA.17.27	And the people answered him in this manner, saying, 
1SA.17.28	Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s 
1SA.17.29	And David said, “What have I done now? 
1SA.17.30	Then he turned from him toward another and 
1SA.17.31	Now when the words which David spoke were heard, they reported 
1SA.17.32	Then David said to Saul, 
1SA.17.33	And Saul said to David, 
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a 
1SA.17.35	I went out after it and struck it, and delivered 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	Moreover David said, 
1SA.17.37	And Saul said to David, 
1SA.17.38	So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail. 
1SA.17.39	David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested 
1SA.17.40	Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine. 
1SA.17.41	So the Philistine came, and began drawing near to David, and the man who bore the shield 
1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he 
1SA.17.43	So the Philistine 
1SA.17.44	And the Philistine 
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. 
1SA.17.46	This day the 
1SA.17.47	Then all this assembly shall know that the 
1SA.17.48	So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried and 
1SA.17.49	Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung 
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a 
1SA.17.51	Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his 
1SA.17.51	And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, 
1SA.17.52	Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to 
1SA.17.53	Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents. 
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.
1SA.17.55	When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to 
1SA.17.55	And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”
1SA.17.56	So the king said, “Inquire whose son this young man 
1SA.17.57	Then, as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul 
1SA.17.58	And Saul said to him, “Whose son 
1SA.17.58	So David answered, 
1SA.18.1	Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, 
1SA.18.2	Saul took him that day, 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan and David made a 
1SA.18.4	And Jonathan took off the robe that 
1SA.18.5	So David went out wherever Saul sent him, 
1SA.18.6	Now it had happened as they were coming 
1SA.18.7	So the women 
1SA.18.7	“Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	And David his ten thousands.”
1SA.18.8	Then Saul was very angry, and the saying 
1SA.18.9	So Saul eyed David from that day forward.
1SA.18.10	And it happened on the next day that 
1SA.18.11	And Saul 
1SA.18.12	Now Saul was 
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and 
1SA.18.14	And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and 
1SA.18.15	Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	But 
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; 
1SA.18.18	So David said to Saul, 
1SA.18.19	But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to 
1SA.18.20	Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	So Saul said, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that 
1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly, and say, ‘Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”
1SA.18.23	So Saul’s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you 
1SA.18.24	And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “In this manner David spoke.”
1SA.18.25	Then Saul said, “Thus you shall say to David: ‘The king does not desire any 
1SA.18.26	So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king’s son-in-law. Now 
1SA.18.27	therefore David arose and went, he and 
1SA.18.28	Thus Saul saw and knew that the 
1SA.18.29	and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David’s enemy continually. 
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines 
1SA.19.1	Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill 
1SA.19.2	So Jonathan told David, saying, “My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret 
1SA.19.3	And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you 
1SA.19.4	Thus Jonathan 
1SA.19.5	For he took his 
1SA.19.6	So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “
1SA.19.7	Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence 
1SA.19.8	And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, 
1SA.19.9	Now 
1SA.19.10	Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence; and he drove the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night.
1SA.19.11	Saul also sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” 
1SA.19.12	So Michal 
1SA.19.13	And Michal took an image and laid 
1SA.19.14	So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He 
1SA.19.15	Then Saul sent the messengers 
1SA.19.16	And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a cover of goats’ 
1SA.19.17	Then Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped?”
1SA.19.17	And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! 
1SA.19.18	So David fled and escaped, and went to 
1SA.19.19	Now it was told Saul, saying, “Take note, David 
1SA.19.20	Then 
1SA.19.21	And when Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. 
1SA.19.22	Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that 
1SA.19.22	And 
1SA.19.23	So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then 
1SA.19.24	And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down 
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and went and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What 
1SA.20.2	So Jonathan said to him, “By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It 
1SA.20.3	Then David took an oath again, and said, “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But 
1SA.20.4	So Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you yourself desire, I will do 
1SA.20.5	And David said to Jonathan, “Indeed tomorrow 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked 
1SA.20.7	If he says thus: ‘
1SA.20.8	Therefore you shall 
1SA.20.9	But Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?”
1SA.20.10	Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, or what 
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out into the field. 
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David: “The 
1SA.20.13	may 
1SA.20.14	And you shall not only show me the kindness of the 
1SA.20.15	but 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made 
1SA.20.17	Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; 
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, 
1SA.20.19	And 
1SA.20.20	Then I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target; 
1SA.20.21	and there I will send a lad, 
1SA.20.22	But if I say thus to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows 
1SA.20.23	And as for 
1SA.20.24	Then David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat the feast. 
1SA.20.25	Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him; he 
1SA.20.27	And it happened the next day, the second 
1SA.20.28	So Jonathan 
1SA.20.29	And he said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me 
1SA.20.30	Then Saul’s anger was aroused against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”
1SA.20.32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul 
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.
1SA.20.35	And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad 
1SA.20.36	Then he said to his lad, “Now run, find the arrows which I shoot.” As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, “
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan cried out after the lad, “Make haste, hurry, do not delay!” So Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter. 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, “Go, carry 
1SA.20.41	As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from 
1SA.20.42	Then Jonathan said to David, 
1SA.21.1	Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And 
1SA.21.2	So David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has ordered me on some business, and said to me, ‘Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you, or what I have commanded you.’ And I have directed 
1SA.21.3	Now therefore, what have you on hand? Give 
1SA.21.4	And the priest answered David and said, “
1SA.21.5	Then David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women 
1SA.21.6	So the priest 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul 
1SA.21.8	And David said to Ahimelech, “Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”
1SA.21.9	So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in 
1SA.21.9	And David said, “
1SA.21.10	Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	And 
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	And David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	Now David 
1SA.21.13	So 
1SA.21.14	Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this 
1SA.22.1	David therefore departed from there and 
1SA.22.2	And everyone 
1SA.22.3	Then David went from there to Mizpah of 
1SA.22.4	So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
1SA.22.5	Now the prophet 
1SA.22.6	When Saul heard that David and the men who 
1SA.22.7	then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse 
1SA.22.8	All of you have conspired against me, and 
1SA.22.9	Then answered 
1SA.22.10	And he inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who 
1SA.22.12	And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahitub!”
1SA.22.12	He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”
1SA.22.13	Then Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?”
1SA.22.14	So Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants 
1SA.22.15	Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, 
1SA.22.16	And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all 
1SA.22.17	Then the king said to the guards who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	And the king said to Doeg, “You turn and kill the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests, and 
1SA.22.19	Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep—with the edge of the sword.
1SA.22.20	Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, 
1SA.22.21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the 
1SA.22.22	So David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me; do not fear. 
1SA.23.1	Then they told David, saying, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against 
1SA.23.2	Therefore David 
1SA.23.2	And the 
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” 
1SA.23.4	Then David inquired of the 
1SA.23.4	And the 
1SA.23.5	And David and his men went to Keilah and 
1SA.23.6	Now it happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech 
1SA.23.7	And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah. So Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	Then Saul called all the people together for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	When David knew that Saul plotted evil against him, 
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O 
1SA.23.11	And the 
1SA.23.12	Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?”
1SA.23.12	And the 
1SA.23.13	So David and his men, 
1SA.23.14	And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in 
1SA.23.15	So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David 
1SA.23.16	Then Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God. 
1SA.23.17	And he said to him, 
1SA.23.18	So the two of them 
1SA.23.19	Then the Ziphites 
1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and 
1SA.23.21	And Saul said, “Blessed 
1SA.23.22	Please go and find out for sure, and see the place where his hideout is, 
1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search for him throughout all the clans of Judah.”
1SA.23.24	So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men 
1SA.23.25	When Saul and his men went to seek 
1SA.23.26	Then Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. 
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!” 
1SA.23.28	Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; so they called that place the Rock of Escape. 
1SA.23.29	Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at 
1SA.24.1	Now it happened, 
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and 
1SA.24.3	So he came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there 
1SA.24.4	Then the men of David said to him, “This is the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	Now it happened afterward that 
1SA.24.6	And he said to his men, 
1SA.24.7	So David 
1SA.24.8	David also arose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed down. 
1SA.24.9	And David said to Saul: 
1SA.24.10	Look, this day your eyes have seen that the 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, see! Yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that 
1SA.24.12	Let the 
1SA.24.13	As the proverb of the ancients says, 
1SA.24.14	After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? 
1SA.24.15	Therefore let the 
1SA.24.16	So it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, 
1SA.24.17	Then he said to David: “You 
1SA.24.18	And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when 
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him get away safely? Therefore may the 
1SA.24.20	And now 
1SA.24.21	Therefore swear now to me by the 
1SA.24.22	So David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up to 
1SA.25.1	Then 
1SA.25.2	Now 
1SA.25.3	The name of the man 
1SA.25.4	When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was 
1SA.25.5	David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, go to Nabal, and greet him in my name. 
1SA.25.6	And thus you shall say to him who lives 
1SA.25.7	Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not hurt them, 
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let 
1SA.25.9	So when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited.
1SA.25.10	Then Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, 
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give 
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men turned on their heels and went back; and they came and told him all these words. 
1SA.25.13	Then David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword.” So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went with David, and two hundred 
1SA.25.14	Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master; and he reviled them. 
1SA.25.15	But the men 
1SA.25.16	They were 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for 
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail made haste and 
1SA.25.19	And she said to her servants, 
1SA.25.20	So it was, 
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected all that this 
1SA.25.22	May God do so, and more also, to the enemies of David, if I 
1SA.25.23	Now when Abigail saw David, she 
1SA.25.24	So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, 
1SA.25.25	Please, let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name 
1SA.25.26	Now therefore, my lord, 
1SA.25.27	And now 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For 
1SA.25.29	Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be 
1SA.25.30	And it shall come to pass, when the 
1SA.25.31	that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. But when the 
1SA.25.32	Then David said to Abigail: 
1SA.25.33	And blessed 
1SA.25.34	For indeed, 
1SA.25.35	So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, 
1SA.25.36	Now Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was, 
1SA.25.37	So it was, in the morning, when the wine had gone from Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became 
1SA.25.38	Then it happened, 
1SA.25.39	So when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, 
1SA.25.39	And David sent and proposed to Abigail, to take her as his wife. 
1SA.25.40	When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her saying, “David sent us to you, to ask you to become his wife.”
1SA.25.41	Then she arose, bowed her face to the earth, and said, “Here is your maidservant, a servant to 
1SA.25.42	So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey, attended by five of her maidens; and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife. 
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahinoam 
1SA.25.44	But Saul had given 
1SA.26.1	Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, 
1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having 
1SA.26.3	And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which 
1SA.26.4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had indeed come.
1SA.26.5	So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and 
1SA.26.6	Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai 
1SA.26.6	And 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay all around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, 
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him; 
1SA.26.10	David said furthermore, “
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the jug of water 
1SA.26.13	Now David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, a great distance 
1SA.26.14	And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Do you not answer, Abner?”
1SA.26.14	Then Abner answered and said, “Who 
1SA.26.15	So David said to Abner, “
1SA.26.16	This thing that you have done 
1SA.26.17	Then Saul knew David’s voice, and said, 
1SA.26.17	David said, “
1SA.26.18	And he said, 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the 
1SA.26.20	So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, 
1SA.26.22	And David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	May the 
1SA.26.24	And indeed, as your life was valued much this day in my eyes, so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “
1SA.26.25	So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	And David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul. 
1SA.27.2	Then David arose 
1SA.27.3	So David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, 
1SA.27.4	And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; so he sought him no more.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If I have now found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	So Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore 
1SA.27.7	Now the time that David 
1SA.27.8	And David and his men went up and raided 
1SA.27.9	Whenever David attacked the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achish. 
1SA.27.10	Then Achish would say, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David would say, “Against the southern 
1SA.27.11	David would save neither man nor woman alive, to bring 
1SA.27.12	So Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; therefore he will be my servant forever.”
1SA.28.1	Now 
1SA.28.2	So David said to Achish, “Surely you know what your servant can do.”
1SA.28.2	And Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever.”
1SA.28.3	Now 
1SA.28.4	Then the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was 
1SA.28.6	And when Saul inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, 
1SA.28.7	And his servants said to him, “In fact, 
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And 
1SA.28.9	Then the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has 
1SA.28.10	And Saul swore to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”
1SA.28.11	And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you 
1SA.28.13	And the king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What did you see?”
1SA.28.13	And the woman said to Saul, “I saw 
1SA.28.14	So he said to her, “What 
1SA.28.14	And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he 
1SA.28.15	Now Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you 
1SA.28.15	And Saul answered, “I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and 
1SA.28.16	Then Samuel said: “So why do you ask me, seeing the 
1SA.28.17	And the 
1SA.28.18	Because you did not obey the voice of the 
1SA.28.19	Moreover the 
1SA.28.20	Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night.
1SA.28.21	And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled, and said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice, and I have 
1SA.28.22	Now therefore, please, heed also the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on 
1SA.28.23	But he refused and said, “I will not eat.”
1SA.28.23	So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice. Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded 
1SA.28.25	So she brought 
1SA.29.1	Then 
1SA.29.2	And the 
1SA.29.3	Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What 
1SA.29.3	And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “
1SA.29.4	But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; so the princes of the Philistines said to him, 
1SA.29.5	 this not David, 
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.29.5	And David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David and said to him, “Surely, 
1SA.29.7	Therefore return now, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”
1SA.29.8	So David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
1SA.29.9	Then Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you 
1SA.29.10	Now therefore, rise early in the morning with your master’s servants 
1SA.29.11	So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. 
1SA.30.1	Now it happened, when David and his men came to 
1SA.30.2	and had taken captive the 
1SA.30.3	So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people who 
1SA.30.5	And David’s two 
1SA.30.6	Now David was greatly distressed, for 
1SA.30.7	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” And 
1SA.30.8	So David inquired of the 
1SA.30.8	And He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men who 
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men; 
1SA.30.11	Then they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water. 
1SA.30.12	And they gave him a piece of 
1SA.30.13	Then David said to him, “To whom do you 
1SA.30.13	And he said, “I 
1SA.30.14	We made an invasion of the southern 
1SA.30.15	And David said to him, “Can you take me down to this troop?”
1SA.30.15	So he said, “Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my 
1SA.30.16	And when he had brought him down, there they were, spread out over all the land, 
1SA.30.17	Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; 
1SA.30.20	Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those 
1SA.30.21	Now David came to the 
1SA.30.22	Then all the wicked and 
1SA.30.23	But David said, “My brethren, you shall not do so with what the 
1SA.30.24	For who will heed you in this matter? But 
1SA.30.25	So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
1SA.30.26	Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent 
1SA.30.27	to 
1SA.30.28	 who 
1SA.30.29	 who 
1SA.30.30	 who 
1SA.30.31	 who 
1SA.31.1	Now 
1SA.31.2	Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed 
1SA.31.3	The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest 
1SA.31.4	But his armorbearer would not, 
1SA.31.5	And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day.
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel who 
1SA.31.8	So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent 
1SA.31.10	Then they put his armor in the temple of the 
1SA.31.11	Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men arose and traveled all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and 
1SA.31.13	Then they took their bones and 
2SA.1.1	Now it came to pass after the 
2SA.1.2	on the third day, behold, it happened that 
2SA.1.3	And David said to him, “Where have you come from?”
2SA.1.3	So he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
2SA.1.4	Then David said to him, 
2SA.1.4	And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and 
2SA.1.5	So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”
2SA.1.6	Then the young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance 
2SA.1.7	Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	And he said to me, ‘Who 
2SA.1.9	He said to me again, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still 
2SA.1.10	So I stood over him and 
2SA.1.11	Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and 
2SA.1.12	And they 
2SA.1.13	Then David said to the young man who told him, “Where 
2SA.1.13	And he answered, “I 
2SA.1.14	So David said to him, “How 
2SA.1.15	Then 
2SA.1.16	So David said to him, 
2SA.1.17	Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, 
2SA.1.18	and he told 
2SA.1.19	“The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places!
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell 
2SA.1.20	Proclaim 
2SA.1.20	Lest 
2SA.1.20	Lest the daughters of 
2SA.1.21	“O 
2SA.1.21	Nor fields of offerings.
2SA.1.21	For the shield of the mighty is cast away there!
2SA.1.21	The shield of Saul, not 
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain,
2SA.1.22	From the fat of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
2SA.1.22	And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
2SA.1.23	“Saul and Jonathan 
2SA.1.23	And in their 
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	They were 
2SA.1.24	“O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	Who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury;
2SA.1.24	Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
2SA.1.25	“How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan 
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;
2SA.1.26	You have been very pleasant to me;
2SA.1.26	Your love to me was wonderful,
2SA.1.26	Surpassing the love of women.
2SA.1.27	“How
2SA.1.27	And the weapons of war perished!”
2SA.2.1	It happened after this that David 
2SA.2.1	And the 
2SA.2.1	David said, “Where shall I go up?”
2SA.2.1	And He said, “To 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there, and his 
2SA.2.3	And David brought up 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came, and there they 
2SA.2.5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, 
2SA.2.6	And now may 
2SA.2.7	Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	But 
2SA.2.9	and he made him king over 
2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, 
2SA.2.11	And 
2SA.2.12	Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to 
2SA.2.13	And 
2SA.2.14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now arise and compete before us.”
2SA.2.14	And Joab said, “Let them arise.”
2SA.2.15	So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, 
2SA.2.16	And each one grasped his opponent by the head and 
2SA.2.17	So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	Now the 
2SA.2.19	So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him and said, “
2SA.2.20	He answered, “I 
2SA.2.21	And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. 
2SA.2.22	So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?” 
2SA.2.23	However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him 
2SA.2.24	Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which 
2SA.2.25	Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?”
2SA.2.27	And Joab said, “
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore. 
2SA.2.29	Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died. 
2SA.2.32	Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which 
2SA.3.1	Now there was a long 
2SA.3.2	Sons were born 
2SA.3.3	his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, 
2SA.3.4	the fourth, 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening 
2SA.3.7	And Saul had a concubine, whose name 
2SA.3.8	Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “
2SA.3.9	May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David 
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, 
2SA.3.11	And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, “Whose 
2SA.3.13	And 
2SA.3.14	So David sent messengers to 
2SA.3.15	And Ishbosheth sent and took her from 
2SA.3.16	Then her husband went along with her to 
2SA.3.17	Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, “In time past you were seeking for David 
2SA.3.18	Now then, do 
2SA.3.19	And Abner also spoke in the hearing of 
2SA.3.20	So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who 
2SA.3.21	Then Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and 
2SA.3.22	At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the troops that 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why 
2SA.3.25	Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know 
2SA.3.26	And when Joab had gone from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know 
2SA.3.27	Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab 
2SA.3.28	Afterward, when David heard 
2SA.3.29	Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother 
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, 
2SA.3.32	So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	And the king sang 
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner die as a 
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound
2SA.3.34	Nor your feet put into fetters;
2SA.3.34	As a man falls before wicked men, 
2SA.3.34	Then all the people wept over him again.
2SA.3.35	And when all the people came 
2SA.3.36	Now all the people took note 
2SA.3.37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner. 
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	And I 
2SA.4.1	When Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, 
2SA.4.2	Now Saul’s son 
2SA.4.3	because the Beerothites fled to 
2SA.4.4	Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son 
2SA.4.5	Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the 
2SA.4.6	And they came there, all the way into the house, 
2SA.4.7	For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain. 
2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, 
2SA.4.9	But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “
2SA.4.10	when 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now 
2SA.4.12	So David 
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel 
2SA.5.2	Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, 
2SA.5.3	Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, 
2SA.5.4	David 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah 
2SA.5.6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion 
2SA.5.8	Now David said on that day, “Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, 
2SA.5.9	Then David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it 
2SA.5.10	So David went on and became great, and 
2SA.5.11	Then 
2SA.5.12	So David knew that the 
2SA.5.13	And 
2SA.5.14	Now 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard 
2SA.5.18	The Philistines also went and deployed themselves in 
2SA.5.19	So David 
2SA.5.19	And the 
2SA.5.20	So David went to 
2SA.5.21	And they left their images there, and David and his men 
2SA.5.22	Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	Therefore 
2SA.5.24	And it shall be, when you 
2SA.5.25	And David did so, as the 
2SA.6.1	Again David gathered all 
2SA.6.2	And 
2SA.6.3	So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which 
2SA.6.4	And they brought it out of 
2SA.6.5	Then David and all the house of Israel 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to 
2SA.6.7	Then the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David became angry because of the 
2SA.6.9	David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David would not move the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	The ark of the 
2SA.6.12	Now it was told King David, saying, “The 
2SA.6.13	And so it was, when 
2SA.6.14	Then David 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	Now as the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	So 
2SA.6.18	And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, 
2SA.6.19	Then he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece 
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious was the king of Israel today, 
2SA.6.21	So David said to Michal, “
2SA.6.22	And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.”
2SA.6.23	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children 
2SA.7.1	Now it came to pass 
2SA.7.2	that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in 
2SA.7.3	Then Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that 
2SA.7.4	But it happened that night that the word of the 
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the 
2SA.7.6	For I have not dwelt in a house 
2SA.7.7	Wherever I have 
2SA.7.8	Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the 
2SA.7.9	And 
2SA.7.10	Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will 
2SA.7.11	since the time that I commanded judges 
2SA.7.12	“When your days are fulfilled and you 
2SA.7.13	He shall build a house for My name, and I will 
2SA.7.14	I will be his Father, and he shall be 
2SA.7.15	But My mercy shall not depart from him, 
2SA.7.16	And 
2SA.7.17	According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O Lord 
2SA.7.20	Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord 
2SA.7.21	For Your word’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know 
2SA.7.22	Therefore 
2SA.7.23	And who 
2SA.7.24	For 
2SA.7.25	“Now, O 
2SA.7.26	So let Your name be magnified forever, saying, ‘The 
2SA.7.27	For You, O 
2SA.7.28	“And now, O Lord 
2SA.7.29	Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You, O Lord 
2SA.8.1	After this it came to pass that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them. And David took Metheg Ammah from the hand of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	Then 
2SA.8.3	David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of 
2SA.8.4	David took from him one thousand 
2SA.8.5	When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of the Syrians. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, 
2SA.8.7	And David took 
2SA.8.8	Also from Betah and from 
2SA.8.9	When Toi king of 
2SA.8.10	then Toi sent Joram his son to King David, to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi); and 
2SA.8.11	King David also 
2SA.8.12	from Syria, from Moab, from the people of Ammon, from the 
2SA.8.13	And David made 
2SA.8.14	He also put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and 
2SA.8.15	So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered judgment and justice to all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab the son of Zeruiah 
2SA.8.17	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada 
2SA.9.1	Now David said, “Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Saul, that I may 
2SA.9.2	And 
2SA.9.2	He said, “At your service!”
2SA.9.3	Then the king said, “
2SA.9.3	And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan 
2SA.9.4	So the king said to him, “Where 
2SA.9.4	And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he 
2SA.9.5	Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
2SA.9.6	Now when 
2SA.9.6	And he answered, “Here is your servant!”
2SA.9.7	So David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.”
2SA.9.8	Then he bowed himself, and said, “What 
2SA.9.9	And the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, 
2SA.9.10	You therefore, and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in 
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will your servant do.”
2SA.9.11	“As for Mephibosheth,” 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, 
2SA.10.1	It happened after this that the 
2SA.10.2	Then David said, “I will show 
2SA.10.2	So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the people of Ammon. 
2SA.10.3	And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has David not 
2SA.10.4	Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut off their garments in the middle, 
2SA.10.5	When they told David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and 
2SA.10.6	When the people of Ammon saw that they 
2SA.10.7	Now when David heard 
2SA.10.8	Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate. And 
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s best and put 
2SA.10.10	And the rest of the people he put under the command of 
2SA.10.11	Then he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be of good courage, and let us 
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the people who 
2SA.10.14	When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai, and entered the city. So Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went to 
2SA.10.15	When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered together. 
2SA.10.16	Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who 
2SA.10.17	When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle array against David and fought with him. 
2SA.10.18	Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand 
2SA.10.19	And when all the kings 
2SA.11.1	It happened in the spring of the year, at the 
2SA.11.2	Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed 
2SA.11.3	So David sent and inquired about the woman. And 
2SA.11.4	Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and 
2SA.11.5	And the woman conceived; so she sent and told David, and said, “I 
2SA.11.6	Then David sent to Joab, 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the war prospered. 
2SA.11.8	And David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the 
2SA.11.10	So when they told David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”
2SA.11.11	And Uriah said to David, 
2SA.11.12	Then David said to Uriah, “Wait here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	Now when David called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him 
2SA.11.14	In the morning it happened that David 
2SA.11.15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may 
2SA.11.16	So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there 
2SA.11.17	Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And 
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war, 
2SA.11.19	and charged the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king, 
2SA.11.20	if it happens that the king’s wrath rises, and he says to you: ‘Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who struck 
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him. 
2SA.11.23	And the messenger said to David, “Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and 
2SA.11.25	Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab: ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.’ So encourage him.”
2SA.11.26	When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she 
2SA.12.1	Then the 
2SA.12.2	The rich 
2SA.12.3	But the poor 
2SA.12.4	And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
2SA.12.5	So David’s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, “
2SA.12.6	And he shall restore 
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, “You 
2SA.12.8	I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if 
2SA.12.9	Why have you 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore, 
2SA.12.11	Thus says the 
2SA.12.12	For you did 
2SA.12.13	So David said to Nathan, 
2SA.12.13	And Nathan said to David, “The 
2SA.12.14	However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the 
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan departed to his house.
2SA.12.15	And the 
2SA.12.16	David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and 
2SA.12.17	So the elders of his house arose 
2SA.12.18	Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, “Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!”
2SA.12.19	When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”
2SA.12.19	And they said, “He is dead.”
2SA.12.20	So David arose from the ground, washed and 
2SA.12.21	Then his servants said to him, “What 
2SA.12.22	And he said, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go 
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So 
2SA.12.25	and He sent 
2SA.12.26	Now 
2SA.12.27	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city’s water 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it. 
2SA.12.30	Then he took their king’s crown from his head. Its weight 
2SA.12.31	And he brought out the people who 
2SA.13.1	After this 
2SA.13.2	Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend whose name 
2SA.13.4	And he said to him, “Why 
2SA.13.4	Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
2SA.13.5	So Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see 
2SA.13.6	Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come and 
2SA.13.7	And David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Now go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded 
2SA.13.9	And she took the pan and placed 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought 
2SA.13.11	Now when she had brought 
2SA.13.12	But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me, for 
2SA.13.13	And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; 
2SA.13.14	However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he 
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her 
2SA.13.16	So she said to him, “No, indeed! This evil of sending me away 
2SA.13.16	But he would not listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant who attended him, and said, “Here! Put this 
2SA.13.18	Now she had on 
2SA.13.19	Then Tamar put 
2SA.13.20	And Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He 
2SA.13.21	But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. 
2SA.13.22	And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon 
2SA.13.23	And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom 
2SA.13.24	Then Absalom came to the king and said, “Kindly note, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.”
2SA.13.25	But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you.” Then he urged him, but he would not go; and he blessed him.
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.”
2SA.13.26	And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom urged him; so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2SA.13.28	Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, “Watch now, when Amnon’s 
2SA.13.29	So the servants of Absalom 
2SA.13.30	And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left!” 
2SA.13.31	So the king arose and 
2SA.13.32	Then 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore, 
2SA.13.34	Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked, and there, many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind him. 
2SA.13.35	And Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.” 
2SA.13.36	So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that the king’s sons indeed came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled and went to 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled and went to 
2SA.13.39	And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been 
2SA.14.1	So Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart 
2SA.14.2	And Joab sent to 
2SA.14.3	Go to the king and speak to him in this manner.” So Joab 
2SA.14.4	And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she 
2SA.14.5	Then the king said to her, “What troubles you?”
2SA.14.5	And she answered, 
2SA.14.6	Now your maidservant had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and 
2SA.14.7	And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant, and they said, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him 
2SA.14.8	Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.”
2SA.14.9	And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, 
2SA.14.10	So the king said, “Whoever says 
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Please let the king remember the 
2SA.14.11	And he said, 
2SA.14.12	Therefore the woman said, “Please, let your maidservant speak 
2SA.14.12	And he said, “Say on.”
2SA.14.13	So the woman said: “Why then have you schemed such a thing against 
2SA.14.14	For we 
2SA.14.15	Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant. 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man 
2SA.14.17	Your maidservant said, ‘The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you.”
2SA.14.18	And the woman said, “Please, let my lord the king speak.”
2SA.14.19	So the king said, “
2SA.14.20	To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord 
2SA.14.21	And the king said to Joab, “All right, I have granted this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”
2SA.14.22	Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and thanked the king. And Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.” 
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose 
2SA.14.24	And the king said, “Let him return to his own house, but 
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks. 
2SA.14.26	And when he cut the hair of his head—at the end of every year he cut 
2SA.14.27	To Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name 
2SA.14.28	And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, 
2SA.14.29	Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come. 
2SA.14.30	So he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose and came to Absalom’s house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”
2SA.14.32	And Absalom answered Joab, “Look, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? 
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to the king and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. Then the king 
2SA.15.1	After this 
2SA.15.2	Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. 
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case 
2SA.15.4	Moreover Absalom would say, 
2SA.15.5	And 
2SA.15.6	In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. 
2SA.15.7	Now it came to pass 
2SA.15.8	For your servant 
2SA.15.9	And the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron.
2SA.15.10	Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom 
2SA.15.11	And with Absalom went two hundred men 
2SA.15.12	Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
2SA.15.13	Now a messenger came to David, saying, 
2SA.15.14	So David said to all his servants who 
2SA.15.15	And the king’s servants said to the king, “We 
2SA.15.16	Then 
2SA.15.17	And the king went out with all the people after him, and stopped at the outskirts. 
2SA.15.18	Then all his servants passed before him; 
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to 
2SA.15.20	In fact, you came 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered the king and said, 
2SA.15.22	So David said to Ittai, “Go, and cross over.” Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who 
2SA.15.23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people crossed over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the 
2SA.15.24	There was 
2SA.15.25	Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the 
2SA.15.26	But if He says thus: ‘I have no 
2SA.15.27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “
2SA.15.28	See, 
2SA.15.29	Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.
2SA.15.30	So David went up by the Ascent of the 
2SA.15.31	Then 
2SA.15.32	Now it happened when David had come to the top 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you go on with me, then you will become 
2SA.15.34	But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, 
2SA.15.35	And 
2SA.15.36	Indeed 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, 
2SA.16.1	When
2SA.16.2	And the king said to Ziba, “What do you mean to do with these?”
2SA.16.2	So Ziba said, “The donkeys 
2SA.16.3	Then the king said, “And where 
2SA.16.3	And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’ ”
2SA.16.4	So the king said to Ziba, “Here, all that 
2SA.16.4	And Ziba said, “I humbly bow before you, 
2SA.16.5	Now when King David came to 
2SA.16.6	And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men 
2SA.16.7	Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: “Come out! Come out! You bloodthirsty man, 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this 
2SA.16.10	But the king said, 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Abishai and all his servants, “See how 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	And as David and his men went along the road, Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him and kicked up dust. 
2SA.16.14	Now the king and all the people who 
2SA.16.15	Meanwhile 
2SA.16.16	And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, 
2SA.16.17	So Absalom said to Hushai, “
2SA.16.18	And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, but whom the 
2SA.16.19	Furthermore, 
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to 
2SA.16.21	And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s 
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines 
2SA.16.23	Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, 
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will come upon him while he 
2SA.17.3	Then I will bring back all the people to you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people will be at peace.” 
2SA.17.4	And the saying pleased Absalom and all the 
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he 
2SA.17.6	And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.”
2SA.17.7	So Hushai said to Absalom: “The advice that Ahithophel has given 
2SA.17.8	For,” said Hushai, “you know your father and his men, that they 
2SA.17.9	Surely by now he is hidden in some pit, or in some 
2SA.17.10	And even he 
2SA.17.11	Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, 
2SA.17.12	So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who 
2SA.17.13	Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we will 
2SA.17.14	So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised. 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend this night 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz 
2SA.17.18	Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man’s house 
2SA.17.19	Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known. 
2SA.17.20	And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where 
2SA.17.20	So 
2SA.17.20	And when they had searched and could not find 
2SA.17.21	Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said to David, 
2SA.17.22	So David and all the people who 
2SA.17.23	Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to 
2SA.17.24	Then David went to 
2SA.17.25	And Absalom made 
2SA.17.26	So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	Now it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that 
2SA.17.28	brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, parched 
2SA.17.29	honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who 
2SA.18.1	And David numbered the people who 
2SA.18.2	Then David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, 
2SA.18.3	But the people answered, “You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us. But 
2SA.18.4	Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, “
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel. And the battle was in the 
2SA.18.7	The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David, and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day. 
2SA.18.8	For the battle there was scattered over the face of the whole countryside, and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	Then Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule. The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and 
2SA.18.10	Now a certain man saw 
2SA.18.11	So Joab said to the man who told him, “You just saw 
2SA.18.12	But the man said to Joab, “Though I were to receive a thousand 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against 
2SA.18.14	Then Joab said, “I cannot linger with you.” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart, while he was 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him.
2SA.18.16	So Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab held back the people. 
2SA.18.17	And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods, and 
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which 
2SA.18.19	Then 
2SA.18.20	And Joab said to him, “You shall not take the news this day, for you shall take the news another day. But today you shall take no news, because the king’s son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran.
2SA.18.22	And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.”
2SA.18.22	So Joab said, “Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?”
2SA.18.23	“But whatever happens,” 
2SA.18.23	So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the 
2SA.18.25	Then the watchman cried out and told the king. And the king said, “If he 
2SA.18.26	Then the watchman saw 
2SA.18.26	And the king said, “He also brings news.”
2SA.18.27	So the watchman said, “I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.”
2SA.18.27	And the king said, “He 
2SA.18.28	So Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well!” Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king, and said, 
2SA.18.29	The king said, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and 
2SA.18.30	And the king said, “Turn aside 
2SA.18.31	Just then the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, “There is good news, my lord the king! For the 
2SA.18.32	And the king said to the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”
2SA.18.32	So the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against you to do harm, be like 
2SA.18.33	Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: 
2SA.19.1	And Joab was told, “Behold, the king is weeping and 
2SA.19.2	So the victory that day was 
2SA.19.3	And the people stole back 
2SA.19.4	But the king 
2SA.19.5	Then 
2SA.19.6	in that you love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, then it would have pleased you well. 
2SA.19.7	Now therefore, arise, go out and speak comfort to your servants. For I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose and sat in the 
2SA.19.8	For everyone of Israel had 
2SA.19.9	Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king saved us from the hand of our 
2SA.19.10	But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing back the king?”
2SA.19.11	So King David sent to 
2SA.19.12	You 
2SA.19.13	And say to Amasa, ‘
2SA.19.14	So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah, 
2SA.19.15	Then the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to 
2SA.19.16	And 
2SA.19.18	Then a ferryboat went across to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good.
2SA.19.18	Now Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan. 
2SA.19.19	Then he said to the king, 
2SA.19.20	For I, your servant, know that I have sinned. Therefore here I am, the first to come today of all 
2SA.19.21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, 
2SA.19.22	And David said, 
2SA.19.23	Therefore 
2SA.19.24	Now 
2SA.19.25	So it was, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, 
2SA.19.26	And he answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go to the king,’ because your servant 
2SA.19.27	And 
2SA.19.28	For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king. 
2SA.19.29	So the king said to him, “Why do you speak anymore of your matters? I have said, ‘You and Ziba divide the land.’ ”
2SA.19.30	Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Rather, let him take it all, inasmuch as my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house.”
2SA.19.31	And 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. And 
2SA.19.33	And the king said to Barzillai, “Come across with me, and I will provide for you while you are with me in Jerusalem.”
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai said to the king, “How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I 
2SA.19.36	Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king. And why should the king repay me 
2SA.19.37	Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant 
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you. Now whatever you request of me, I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.39	Then all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king 
2SA.19.40	Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. And all the people of Judah escorted the king, and also half the people of Israel. 
2SA.19.41	Just then all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and 
2SA.19.42	So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king 
2SA.19.43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, 
2SA.19.43	Yet 
2SA.20.1	And there happened to be there a rebel, whose name 
2SA.20.1	“We have no share in David,
2SA.20.1	Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse;
2SA.20.1	Every man to his tents, O Israel!”
2SA.20.2	So every man of Israel deserted David, 
2SA.20.3	Now David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, 
2SA.20.4	And the king said to Amasa, 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to assemble 
2SA.20.6	And David said to 
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men, with the 
2SA.20.8	When they 
2SA.20.9	Then Joab said to Amasa, “
2SA.20.10	But Amasa did not notice the sword that 
2SA.20.10	Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	Meanwhile one of Joab’s men stood near Amasa, and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever 
2SA.20.12	But Amasa wallowed in 
2SA.20.13	When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel to 
2SA.20.15	Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come nearby, that I may speak with you.’ ” 
2SA.20.17	When he had come near to her, the woman said, “
2SA.20.17	He answered, “I 
2SA.20.17	Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your maidservant.”
2SA.20.17	And he answered, “I am listening.”
2SA.20.18	So she spoke, saying, “They used to talk in former times, saying, ‘They shall surely seek 
2SA.20.19	I 
2SA.20.20	And Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy! 
2SA.20.21	That 
2SA.20.21	So the woman said to Joab, “Watch, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman 
2SA.20.23	And 
2SA.20.24	Adoram 
2SA.20.25	Sheva 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite was a chief minister under David.
2SA.21.1	Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David 
2SA.21.2	So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites 
2SA.21.3	Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless 
2SA.21.4	And the Gibeonites said to him, “We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us.”
2SA.21.4	So he said, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”
2SA.21.5	Then they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men of his descendants be delivered 
2SA.21.6	And the king said, “I will give 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared 
2SA.21.8	So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of 
2SA.21.9	and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill 
2SA.21.10	Now 
2SA.21.11	And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
2SA.21.12	Then David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of 
2SA.21.13	So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. 
2SA.21.14	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in 
2SA.21.15	When the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint. 
2SA.21.16	Then Ishbi-Benob, who 
2SA.21.17	But 
2SA.21.18	Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then 
2SA.21.19	Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where 
2SA.21.20	Yet again 
2SA.21.21	So when he 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	Then David 
2SA.22.2	And he 
2SA.22.2	“The 
2SA.22.3	The God of my strength, 
2SA.22.3	My 
2SA.22.3	My 
2SA.22.3	My Savior, You save me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I will call upon the 
2SA.22.4	So shall I be saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	“When the waves of death surrounded me,
2SA.22.5	The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
2SA.22.6	The 
2SA.22.6	The snares of death confronted me.
2SA.22.7	In my distress 
2SA.22.7	And cried out to my God;
2SA.22.7	He 
2SA.22.7	And my cry 
2SA.22.8	“Then 
2SA.22.8	The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,
2SA.22.8	Because He was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up from His nostrils,
2SA.22.9	And devouring 
2SA.22.9	Coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He 
2SA.22.10	With 
2SA.22.11	He rode upon a cherub, and flew;
2SA.22.11	And He was seen 
2SA.22.12	He made 
2SA.22.12	Dark waters 
2SA.22.13	From the brightness before Him
2SA.22.13	Coals of fire were kindled.
2SA.22.14	“The 
2SA.22.14	And the Most High uttered His voice.
2SA.22.15	He sent out 
2SA.22.15	Lightning bolts, and He vanquished them.
2SA.22.16	Then the channels of the sea 
2SA.22.16	The foundations of the world were uncovered,
2SA.22.16	At the 
2SA.22.16	At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
2SA.22.17	“He
2SA.22.17	He drew me out of many waters.
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	From those who hated me;
2SA.22.18	For they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
2SA.22.19	But the 
2SA.22.20	He also brought me out into a broad place;
2SA.22.20	He delivered me because He 
2SA.22.21	“The
2SA.22.21	According to the 
2SA.22.21	He has recompensed me.
2SA.22.22	For I have 
2SA.22.22	And have not wickedly departed from my God.
2SA.22.23	For all His 
2SA.22.23	And 
2SA.22.24	I was also 
2SA.22.24	And I kept myself from my iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore 
2SA.22.25	According to my cleanness in His eyes.
2SA.22.26	“With 
2SA.22.26	With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless;
2SA.22.27	With the pure You will show Yourself pure;
2SA.22.27	And 
2SA.22.28	You will save the 
2SA.22.28	But Your eyes 
2SA.22.29	“For You 
2SA.22.29	The 
2SA.22.30	For by You I can run against a troop;
2SA.22.30	By my God I can leap over a

2SA.22.34	He makes my feet 
2SA.22.34	And 
2SA.22.35	He teaches my hands to make war,
2SA.22.35	So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	“You have also given me the shield of Your salvation;
2SA.22.36	Your gentleness has made me great.
2SA.22.37	You 
2SA.22.37	So my feet did not slip.
2SA.22.38	“I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them;
2SA.22.38	Neither did I turn back again till they were destroyed.
2SA.22.39	And I have destroyed them and wounded them,
2SA.22.39	So that they could not rise;
2SA.22.39	They have fallen

2SA.22.40	You have subdued under me

2SA.22.42	They looked, but 
2SA.22.43	Then I beat them as fine 
2SA.22.43	I trod them 
2SA.22.43	 I spread them out.
2SA.22.44	“You
2SA.22.44	You have kept me as the 
2SA.22.44	A people I have not known shall serve me.
2SA.22.45	The foreigners submit to me;
2SA.22.45	As soon as they hear, they obey me.
2SA.22.46	The foreigners fade away,
2SA.22.46	And come frightened

2SA.22.47	Blessed 
2SA.22.47	Let God be exalted,
2SA.22.47	The

2SA.22.49	He delivers me from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	You also lift me up above those who rise against me;
2SA.22.49	You have delivered me from the 
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks to You, O 
2SA.22.50	And sing praises to Your

2SA.22.51	And shows mercy to His 
2SA.22.51	To David and 
2SA.23.1	Now these 
2SA.23.1	 says David the son of Jesse;
2SA.23.1	 says 
2SA.23.1	The anointed of the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	And the sweet psalmist of Israel:
2SA.23.2	“The
2SA.23.2	And His word 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said,
2SA.23.3	The Rock of Israel spoke to me:
2SA.23.3	‘He who rules over men 
2SA.23.3	Ruling 
2SA.23.4	And 
2SA.23.4	A morning without clouds,
2SA.23.4	 the tender grass 
2SA.23.4	By clear shining after rain.’
2SA.23.5	“Although my house 
2SA.23.5	Yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant,
2SA.23.5	Ordered in all 
2SA.23.5	For 
2SA.23.5	Will He not make 
2SA.23.6	But 
2SA.23.6	Because they cannot be taken with hands.
2SA.23.7	But the man 
2SA.23.7	Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,
2SA.23.7	And they shall be utterly burned with fire in 
2SA.23.8	These 
2SA.23.9	And after him 
2SA.23.10	He arose and attacked the Philistines until his hand was 
2SA.23.11	And after him 
2SA.23.12	But he stationed himself in the middle of the field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. So the 
2SA.23.13	Then 
2SA.23.14	David 
2SA.23.15	And David said with longing, “Oh, that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem, which 
2SA.23.16	So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that 
2SA.23.17	And he said, “Far be it from me, O 
2SA.23.17	These things were done by the three mighty men.
2SA.23.18	Now 
2SA.23.19	Was he not the most honored of three? Therefore he became their captain. However, he did not attain to the 
2SA.23.20	Benaiah 
2SA.23.21	And he killed an Egyptian, a spectacular man. The Egyptian 
2SA.23.22	These 
2SA.23.23	He was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the

2SA.24.2	So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who 
2SA.24.3	And Joab said to the king, “Now may the 
2SA.24.4	Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.
2SA.24.5	And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in 
2SA.24.6	Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to 
2SA.24.7	and they came to the stronghold of 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. 
2SA.24.10	And 
2SA.24.11	Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the

2SA.24.16	And when the angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, 
2SA.24.17	Then David spoke to the

2SA.24.19	So David, according to the word of Gad, went up as the 
2SA.24.20	Now Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.
2SA.24.21	Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
2SA.24.21	And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the

2SA.24.23	All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king.”
2SA.24.23	And Araunah said to the king, “May the

2SA.24.25	And David built there an altar to the 
1KI.1.1	Now King David was 
1KI.1.2	Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and let her care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found 
1KI.1.4	The young woman 
1KI.1.5	Then 
1KI.1.6	(And his father had not rebuked him at any time by saying, “Why have you done so?” He 
1KI.1.7	Then he conferred with 
1KI.1.8	But 
1KI.1.9	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which 
1KI.1.10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or 
1KI.1.11	So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of 
1KI.1.12	Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go immediately to King David and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, 
1KI.1.14	Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.) 
1KI.1.16	And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. Then the king said, “What is your wish?”
1KI.1.17	Then she said to him, “My lord, 
1KI.1.18	So now, look! Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know about 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited. 
1KI.1.20	And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king 
1KI.1.22	And just then, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 
1KI.1.23	So they told the king, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, “My lord, O king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, 
1KI.1.26	But he has not invited me—me your servant—nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
1KI.1.28	Then King David answered and said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	And the king took an oath and said, 
1KI.1.30	just as I swore to you by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed with 
1KI.1.32	And King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	The king also said to them, 
1KI.1.34	There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet 
1KI.1.35	Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”
1KI.1.36	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, 
1KI.1.39	Then Zadok the priest took a horn of 
1KI.1.40	And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth 
1KI.1.41	Now Adonijah and all the guests who 
1KI.1.42	While he was still speaking, there came 
1KI.1.43	Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This 
1KI.1.46	Also Solomon 
1KI.1.47	And moreover the king’s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, 
1KI.1.48	Also the king said thus, ‘Blessed 
1KI.1.49	So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way.
1KI.1.50	Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and 
1KI.1.51	And it was told Solomon, saying, “Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”
1KI.1.52	Then Solomon said, “If he proves himself a worthy man, 
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar. And he came and fell down before King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
1KI.2.1	Now 
1KI.2.2	“I go the way of all the earth; 
1KI.2.3	And keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	that the 
1KI.2.5	“Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah 
1KI.2.6	Therefore do 
1KI.2.7	“But show kindness to the sons of 
1KI.2.8	“And see, 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore, 
1KI.2.10	So 
1KI.2.11	The period that David 
1KI.2.12	Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was 
1KI.2.13	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. So she said, 
1KI.2.13	And he said, “Peaceably.” 
1KI.2.14	Moreover he said, “I have something 
1KI.2.14	And she said, “Say it.”
1KI.2.15	Then he said, “You know that the kingdom was 
1KI.2.16	Now I ask one petition of you; do not deny me.”
1KI.2.16	And she said to him, “Say it.”
1KI.2.17	Then he said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me 
1KI.2.18	So Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak for you to the king.”
1KI.2.19	Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, “I desire one small petition of you; do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.20	And the king said to her, “Ask it, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”
1KI.2.22	And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Now why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also—for he 
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by the 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore, 
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon sent by the hand of 
1KI.2.26	And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the 
1KI.2.28	Then news came to Joab, for Joab 
1KI.2.29	And King Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.30	And he said, “No, but I will die here.” And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”
1KI.2.31	Then the king said to him, 
1KI.2.32	So the 
1KI.2.33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king put 
1KI.2.36	Then the king sent and called for 
1KI.2.37	For it shall be, on the day you go out and cross 
1KI.2.38	And Shimei said to the king, “The saying 
1KI.2.39	Now it happened at the end of three years, that two slaves of Shimei ran away to 
1KI.2.40	So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves. And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back. 
1KI.2.42	Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then have you not kept the oath of the 
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know, as your heart acknowledges, 
1KI.2.45	But King Solomon 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died. Thus the 
1KI.3.1	Now 
1KI.3.2	Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the 
1KI.3.3	And Solomon 
1KI.3.4	Now 
1KI.3.5	At Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon said: “You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he 
1KI.3.7	Now, O 
1KI.3.8	And Your servant 
1KI.3.9	Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart 
1KI.3.10	The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have 
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to your words; 
1KI.3.13	And I have also 
1KI.3.14	So 
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon 
1KI.3.16	Now two women 
1KI.3.17	And one woman said, “O my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth while she 
1KI.3.18	Then it happened, the third day after I had given birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we 
1KI.3.19	And this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him. 
1KI.3.20	So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, there he was, dead. But when I had examined him in the morning, indeed, he was not my son whom I had borne.”
1KI.3.22	Then the other woman said, “No! But the living one 
1KI.3.22	And the first woman said, “No! But the dead one 
1KI.3.22	Thus they spoke before the king.
1KI.3.23	And the king said, “The one says, ‘This 
1KI.3.24	Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.”
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose son 
1KI.3.26	But the other said, “Let him be neither mine nor yours, 
1KI.3.27	So the king answered and said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she 
1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they feared the king, for they saw that the 
1KI.4.1	So King Solomon was king over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	And these 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; 
1KI.4.4	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, over the army; Zadok and 
1KI.4.5	Azariah the son of Nathan, over 
1KI.4.6	Ahishar, over the household; and 
1KI.4.7	And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month of the year. 
1KI.4.8	These 
1KI.4.9	Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan; 
1KI.4.10	Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; to him 
1KI.4.11	Ben-Abinadab, 
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud, 
1KI.4.13	Ben-Geber, in Ramoth Gilead; to him 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife; 
1KI.4.16	Baanah the son of 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin; 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, 
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel 
1KI.4.21	So 
1KI.4.22	Now Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, sixty kors of meal, 
1KI.4.23	ten fatted oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl.
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all 
1KI.4.25	And Judah and Israel 
1KI.4.26	Solomon had forty thousand stalls of 
1KI.4.27	And 
1KI.4.28	They also brought barley and straw to the proper place, for the horses and steeds, each man according to his charge.
1KI.4.29	And 
1KI.4.30	Thus Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the men 
1KI.4.31	For he was 
1KI.4.32	He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his 
1KI.4.33	Also he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree of Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish. 
1KI.4.34	And men of all nations, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, 
1KI.5.1	Now 
1KI.5.2	Then 
1KI.5.3	You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	And behold, I propose to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Now therefore, command that they cut down 
1KI.5.7	So it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said,
1KI.5.7	Blessed 
1KI.5.8	Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying:
1KI.5.8	I have considered 
1KI.5.9	My servants shall bring 
1KI.5.10	Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs 
1KI.5.11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat 
1KI.5.12	So the 
1KI.5.13	Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon 
1KI.5.15	Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens, and eighty thousand who quarried 
1KI.5.16	besides three thousand three hundred from the 
1KI.5.17	And the king commanded them to quarry large stones, costly stones, 
1KI.5.18	So Solomon’s builders, Hiram’s builders, and the Gebalites quarried 
1KI.6.1	And 
1KI.6.2	Now 
1KI.6.3	The vestibule in front of the sanctuary of the house 
1KI.6.4	And he made for the house 
1KI.6.5	Against the wall of the temple he built 
1KI.6.6	The lowest chamber 
1KI.6.7	And 
1KI.6.8	The doorway for the middle story 
1KI.6.9	So he built the temple and finished it, and he paneled the temple with beams and boards of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	And he built side chambers against the entire temple, each five cubits high; they were attached to the temple with cedar beams.
1KI.6.11	Then the word of the 
1KI.6.12	“
1KI.6.13	And 
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the temple and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	And he built the inside walls of the temple with cedar boards; from the floor of the temple to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the temple with planks of cypress. 
1KI.6.16	Then he built the twenty-cubit room at the rear of the temple, from floor to ceiling, with cedar boards; he built 
1KI.6.17	And in front of it the temple sanctuary was forty cubits 
1KI.6.18	The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with ornamental buds and open flowers. All 
1KI.6.19	And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple, to set the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	The inner sanctuary 
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold. He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	The whole temple he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the temple; also he overlaid with gold 
1KI.6.23	Inside the inner sanctuary 
1KI.6.24	One wing of the cherub 
1KI.6.25	And the other cherub 
1KI.6.26	The height of one cherub 
1KI.6.27	Then he set the cherubim inside the inner room; and 
1KI.6.28	Also he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	Then he carved all the walls of the temple all around, both the inner and outer 
1KI.6.30	And the floor of the temple he overlaid with gold, both the inner and outer 
1KI.6.31	For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors 
1KI.6.32	The two doors 
1KI.6.33	So for the door of the sanctuary he also made doorposts 
1KI.6.34	And the two doors 
1KI.6.35	Then he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers 
1KI.6.36	And he built the 
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the 
1KI.6.38	And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans. So he was 
1KI.7.1	But Solomon took 
1KI.7.2	He also built the 
1KI.7.3	And 
1KI.7.5	And all the doorways and doorposts 
1KI.7.6	He also made the Hall of Pillars: its length 
1KI.7.7	Then he made a hall for the throne, the Hall of Judgment, where he might judge; and 
1KI.7.8	And the house where he dwelt 
1KI.7.9	All these 
1KI.7.10	The foundation 
1KI.7.11	And above 
1KI.7.12	The great court 
1KI.7.13	Now King Solomon sent and brought Huram from Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He 
1KI.7.15	And he cast 
1KI.7.16	Then he made two capitals 
1KI.7.18	So he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that 
1KI.7.19	The capitals which 
1KI.7.20	The capitals on the two pillars also 
1KI.7.21	Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz. 
1KI.7.22	The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies. So the work of the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.23	And he made 
1KI.7.24	Below its brim 
1KI.7.25	It stood on 
1KI.7.26	It 
1KI.7.27	He also made ten carts of bronze; four cubits 
1KI.7.28	And this 
1KI.7.29	on the panels that 
1KI.7.30	Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the laver 
1KI.7.31	Its opening inside the crown at the top 
1KI.7.32	Under the panels 
1KI.7.33	The workmanship of the wheels 
1KI.7.34	And 
1KI.7.35	On the top of the cart, at the height of half a cubit, 
1KI.7.36	On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around. 
1KI.7.37	Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same mold, one measure, 
1KI.7.38	Then 
1KI.7.39	And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast.
1KI.7.40	Huram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars, the 
1KI.7.42	four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that 
1KI.7.43	the ten carts, and ten lavers on the carts; 
1KI.7.44	one Sea, and twelve oxen under the Sea; 
1KI.7.45	the pots, the shovels, and the bowls.
1KI.7.45	All these articles which Huram made for King Solomon 
1KI.7.46	In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between 
1KI.7.47	And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because 
1KI.7.48	Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the 
1KI.7.49	the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right 
1KI.7.50	the basins, the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, 
1KI.7.51	So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the 
1KI.8.1	Now 
1KI.8.2	Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with King Solomon at the 
1KI.8.3	So all the elders of Israel came, 
1KI.8.4	Then they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, 
1KI.8.6	Then the priests 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread 
1KI.8.8	The poles 
1KI.8.9	Nothing 
1KI.8.10	And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy 
1KI.8.11	so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon spoke:
1KI.8.12	“The 
1KI.8.13	I have surely built You an exalted house,
1KI.8.13	And a place for You to dwell in forever.”
1KI.8.14	Then the king turned around and 
1KI.8.15	And he said: 
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel 
1KI.8.17	Now 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless 
1KI.8.20	So the 
1KI.8.21	And there I have made a place for the ark, in which 
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before 
1KI.8.23	and he said: “
1KI.8.24	You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled 
1KI.8.25	Therefore, 
1KI.8.26	And now I pray, O God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You have spoken to Your servant David my father.
1KI.8.27	“But 
1KI.8.28	Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O 
1KI.8.29	that Your eyes may be open toward this temple night and day, toward the place of which You said, 
1KI.8.30	And may You hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear in heaven Your dwelling place; and when You hear, forgive.
1KI.8.31	“When anyone sins against his neighbor, and is forced to take 
1KI.8.32	then hear in heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, 
1KI.8.33	“When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and 
1KI.8.34	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their

1KI.8.36	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may 
1KI.8.37	“When there is famine in the land, pestilence 
1KI.8.38	whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, 
1KI.8.39	then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone 
1KI.8.40	that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You gave to our fathers.
1KI.8.41	“Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who 
1KI.8.42	(for they will hear of Your great name and Your 
1KI.8.43	hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, 
1KI.8.44	“When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever You send them, and when they pray to the 
1KI.8.45	then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1KI.8.46	“When they sin against You 
1KI.8.47	 when they come to themselves in the land where they were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication to You in the land of those who took them captive, 
1KI.8.48	and 
1KI.8.49	then hear in heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause, 
1KI.8.50	and forgive Your people who have sinned against You, and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You; and 
1KI.8.51	(for 
1KI.8.52	that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to You. 
1KI.8.53	For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth 
1KI.8.54	And so it was, when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the 
1KI.8.55	Then he stood 
1KI.8.56	“Blessed 
1KI.8.57	May the 
1KI.8.58	that He may 
1KI.8.59	And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	that all the peoples of the earth may know that 
1KI.8.61	Let your

1KI.8.63	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the 
1KI.8.64	On 
1KI.8.65	At that time Solomon held 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that the 
1KI.9.1	And 
1KI.9.2	that the 
1KI.9.3	And the 
1KI.9.4	Now if you 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, 
1KI.9.6	 if you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments 
1KI.9.7	then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated 
1KI.9.8	And 
1KI.9.9	Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the 
1KI.9.10	Now 
1KI.9.11	(Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired), 
1KI.9.12	Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, but they did not please him. 
1KI.9.13	So he said, “What 
1KI.9.14	Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	And this 
1KI.9.16	(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, 
1KI.9.17	And Solomon built Gezer, Lower 
1KI.9.18	Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land 
1KI.9.19	all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for 
1KI.9.20	All the people 
1KI.9.21	that is, their descendants 
1KI.9.22	But of the children of Israel Solomon 
1KI.9.23	Others 
1KI.9.24	But 
1KI.9.25	Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at 
1KI.9.27	Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon. 
1KI.9.28	And they went to 
1KI.10.1	Now when the 
1KI.10.2	She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. 
1KI.10.3	So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for the king that he could not explain 
1KI.10.4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers, 
1KI.10.6	Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I heard. 
1KI.10.8	Happy 
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	Then she 
1KI.10.11	Also, the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought great quantities of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir. 
1KI.10.12	And the king made steps of the almug wood for the house of the 
1KI.10.13	Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
1KI.10.14	The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	besides 
1KI.10.16	And King Solomon made two hundred large shields 
1KI.10.17	He also 
1KI.10.18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like 
1KI.10.21	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels 
1KI.10.22	For the king had 
1KI.10.23	So 
1KI.10.24	Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.
1KI.10.26	And Solomon 
1KI.10.27	The king made silver 
1KI.10.28	Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the 
1KI.10.29	Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred 
1KI.11.1	But 
1KI.11.2	from the nations of whom the 
1KI.11.3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. 
1KI.11.4	For it was so, when Solomon was old, 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after 
1KI.11.6	Solomon did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.11.7	Then Solomon built a high place for 
1KI.11.8	And he did likewise for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1KI.11.9	So the 
1KI.11.10	and 
1KI.11.11	Therefore the 
1KI.11.12	Nevertheless I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 
1KI.11.13	However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I will give 
1KI.11.14	Now the 
1KI.11.15	For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, 
1KI.11.16	(because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel, until he had cut down every male in Edom), 
1KI.11.17	that Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him. Hadad 
1KI.11.18	Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, that is, the sister of Queen Tahpenes. 
1KI.11.20	Then the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.
1KI.11.21	So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David rested with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that suddenly you seek to go to your own country?”
1KI.11.22	So he answered, “Nothing, but do let me go anyway.”
1KI.11.23	And God raised up 
1KI.11.24	So he gathered men to him and became captain over a band 
1KI.11.25	He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon (besides the trouble that Hadad 
1KI.11.26	Then Solomon’s servant, 
1KI.11.27	And this 
1KI.11.28	The man Jeroboam 
1KI.11.29	Now it happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet 
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that 
1KI.11.31	And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for 
1KI.11.32	(but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), 
1KI.11.33	because they have forsaken Me, and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do 
1KI.11.34	However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes. 
1KI.11.35	But 
1KI.11.36	And to his son I will give one tribe, that 
1KI.11.37	So I will take you, and you shall reign over all your heart desires, and you shall be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	Then it shall be, if you heed all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do 
1KI.11.39	And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, but not forever.’ ”
1KI.11.40	Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to 
1KI.11.41	Now 
1KI.11.42	And the period that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel 
1KI.11.43	Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his 
1KI.12.1	And 
1KI.12.2	So it happened, when 
1KI.12.3	that they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our 
1KI.12.5	So he said to them, “Depart 
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, “How do you advise 
1KI.12.7	And they spoke to him, saying, 
1KI.12.8	But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. 
1KI.12.9	And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”
1KI.12.10	Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you should speak to this people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make 
1KI.12.11	And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!’ ”
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had directed, saying, “Come back to me the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	Then the king answered the people roughly, and rejected the advice which the elders had given him; 
1KI.12.14	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people; for 
1KI.12.16	Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying:
1KI.12.16	“What share have we in David?
1KI.12.16	To your tents, O Israel!
1KI.12.16	Now, see to your own house, O David!”
1KI.12.16	So Israel departed to their tents. 
1KI.12.17	But Rehoboam reigned over 
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam 
1KI.12.19	So 
1KI.12.20	Now it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they sent for him and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all 
1KI.12.21	And when 
1KI.12.22	But 
1KI.12.23	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying, 
1KI.12.24	‘Thus says the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam 
1KI.12.26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom may return to the house of David: 
1KI.12.27	If these people 
1KI.12.28	Therefore the king asked advice, 
1KI.12.29	And he set up one in 
1KI.12.30	Now this thing became 
1KI.12.31	He made shrines on the high places, 
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like 
1KI.12.33	So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had 
1KI.13.1	And behold, 
1KI.13.2	Then he cried out against the altar by the word of the 
1KI.13.3	And he gave 
1KI.13.4	So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Arrest him!” Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	Then the king answered and said to the man of God, “Please 
1KI.13.6	So the man of God entreated the 
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and 
1KI.13.8	But the man of God said to the king, 
1KI.13.9	For so it was commanded me by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now an 
1KI.13.12	And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah. 
1KI.13.13	Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it, 
1KI.13.14	and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. Then he said to him, “
1KI.13.14	And he said, “I 
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”
1KI.13.16	And he said, 
1KI.13.17	For I have been told 
1KI.13.18	He said to him, “I too 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
1KI.13.20	Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says the 
1KI.13.22	but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the 
1KI.13.23	So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	When he was gone, 
1KI.13.25	And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. Then they went and told 
1KI.13.26	Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard 
1KI.13.27	And he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled 
1KI.13.28	Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, 
1KI.13.31	So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God 
1KI.13.32	For the saying which he cried out by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became 
1KI.13.34	And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as 
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. 
1KI.14.2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed, Ahijah the prophet 
1KI.14.3	Also take with you ten loaves, 
1KI.14.4	And Jeroboam’s wife did so; she arose 
1KI.14.5	Now the 
1KI.14.6	And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the 
1KI.14.8	and 
1KI.14.9	but you have done more evil than all who were before you, 
1KI.14.10	therefore behold! 
1KI.14.11	The dogs shall eat 
1KI.14.12	Arise therefore, go to your own house. 
1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because in him 
1KI.14.14	“Moreover the 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, 
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to 
1KI.14.18	And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, 
1KI.14.19	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he 
1KI.14.20	The period that Jeroboam reigned 
1KI.14.21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. 
1KI.14.22	Now Judah did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built for themselves 
1KI.14.24	And there were also perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the 
1KI.14.25	It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam 
1KI.14.26	And he took away the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.14.27	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed 
1KI.14.28	And whenever the king entered the house of the 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, 
1KI.14.30	And there was 
1KI.14.31	So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. 
1KI.15.1	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. 
1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless 
1KI.15.5	because David 
1KI.15.6	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
1KI.15.7	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, 
1KI.15.8	So Abijam rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah. 
1KI.15.10	And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother’s name 
1KI.15.11	Asa did 
1KI.15.12	And he banished the perverted persons from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	Also he removed 
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asa’s 
1KI.15.15	He also brought into the house of the 
1KI.15.16	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	And 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and gold 
1KI.15.19	“
1KI.15.20	So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and 
1KI.15.21	Now it happened, when Baasha heard 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none 
1KI.15.23	The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, 
1KI.15.24	So Asa rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. 
1KI.15.25	Now 
1KI.15.26	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.15.27	Then Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at 
1KI.15.28	Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. 
1KI.15.29	And it was so, when he became king, 
1KI.15.30	because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, 
1KI.15.32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and 
1KI.15.34	He did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.1	Then the word of the 
1KI.16.2	“Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, and 
1KI.16.3	surely I will 
1KI.16.4	The dogs shall eat 
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his might, 
1KI.16.6	So Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in 
1KI.16.7	And also the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, 
1KI.16.9	Now his servant Zimri, commander of half 
1KI.16.10	And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
1KI.16.11	Then it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, 
1KI.16.12	Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, 
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people 
1KI.16.16	Now the people 
1KI.16.17	Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house down upon himself with fire, and died, 
1KI.16.19	because of the sins which he had committed in doing evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, 
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, 
1KI.16.24	And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; then he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, 
1KI.16.25	Omri did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.26	For he 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, 
1KI.16.28	So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Then Ahab his son reigned in his place.
1KI.16.29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.31	And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
1KI.16.32	Then he set up an altar for Baal in 
1KI.16.33	And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab 
1KI.16.34	In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation with Abiram his firstborn, and with his youngest 
1KI.17.1	And Elijah the Tishbite, of the 
1KI.17.2	Then the word of the 
1KI.17.3	“Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	And it will be 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according to the word of the 
1KI.17.6	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook. 
1KI.17.7	And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	Then the word of the 
1KI.17.9	“Arise, go to 
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow 
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to get 
1KI.17.12	So she said, “As the 
1KI.17.13	And Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go 
1KI.17.14	For thus says the 
1KI.17.15	So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate for 
1KI.17.16	The bin of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil run dry, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	Now it happened after these things 
1KI.17.18	So she said to Elijah, 
1KI.17.19	And he said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	Then he cried out to the 
1KI.17.21	And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out to the 
1KI.17.22	Then the 
1KI.17.23	And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives!”
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now by this 
1KI.18.1	And it came to pass 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and 
1KI.18.3	And Ahab had called Obadiah, who 
1KI.18.4	For so it was, while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the 
1KI.18.5	And Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1KI.18.7	Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he 
1KI.18.8	And he answered him, “
1KI.18.9	So he said, “How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? 
1KI.18.10	 the 
1KI.18.11	And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah 
1KI.18.12	And it shall come to pass, 
1KI.18.13	Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah 
1KI.18.15	Then Elijah said, “
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, 
1KI.18.18	And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore, send 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and 
1KI.18.21	And Elijah came to all the people, and said, 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, 
1KI.18.23	Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay 
1KI.18.24	Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.24	So all the people answered and said, “It is well spoken.”
1KI.18.25	Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare 
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared 
1KI.18.27	And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry aloud, for he 
1KI.18.28	So they cried aloud, and 
1KI.18.29	And when midday was past, 
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. 
1KI.18.31	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	Then with the stones he built an altar 
1KI.18.33	And he 
1KI.18.34	Then he said, “Do 
1KI.18.35	So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled 
1KI.18.36	And it came to pass, at 
1KI.18.37	Hear me, O 
1KI.18.38	Then 
1KI.18.39	Now when all the people saw 
1KI.18.40	And Elijah said to them, 
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; 
1KI.18.43	and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.”
1KI.18.43	So he went up and looked, and said, “
1KI.18.44	Then it came to pass the seventh 
1KI.18.45	Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	Then the 
1KI.19.1	And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, 
1KI.19.3	And when he saw 
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he 
1KI.19.5	Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise 
1KI.19.6	Then he looked, and there by his head 
1KI.19.7	And the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and 
1KI.19.9	And there he went into a cave, and spent the night in that place; and behold, the word of the 
1KI.19.10	So he said, 
1KI.19.11	Then He said, “Go out, and stand 
1KI.19.12	and after the earthquake a fire, 
1KI.19.13	So it was, when Elijah heard 
1KI.19.14	And he said, “I have been very zealous for the 
1KI.19.15	Then the 
1KI.19.16	Also you shall anoint 
1KI.19.17	It shall be 
1KI.19.18	Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, 
1KI.19.19	So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who 
1KI.19.20	And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, 
1KI.19.20	And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”
1KI.19.21	So 
1KI.20.1	Now 
1KI.20.2	Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad: 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and your gold 
1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered and said, “My lord, O king, just as you say, I and all that I have 
1KI.20.5	Then the messengers came back and said, “Thus speaks Ben-Hadad, saying, ‘Indeed I have sent to you, saying, “You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children”; 
1KI.20.6	but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, 
1KI.20.7	So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Notice, please, and see how this 
1KI.20.8	And all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent.”
1KI.20.9	Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’ ”
1KI.20.9	And the messengers departed and brought back word to him.
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, 
1KI.20.11	So the king of Israel answered and said, “Tell 
1KI.20.12	And it happened when 
1KI.20.13	Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.14	So Ahab said, “By whom?”
1KI.20.14	And he said, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.14	Then he said, “Who will set the battle in order?”
1KI.20.14	And he answered, “You.”
1KI.20.15	Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people, all the children of Israel—seven thousand.
1KI.20.16	So they went out at noon. Meanwhile Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were 
1KI.20.17	The young leaders of the provinces went out first. And Ben-Hadad sent out 
1KI.20.18	So he said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; and if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	Then these young leaders of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them. 
1KI.20.20	And each one killed his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry. 
1KI.20.21	Then the king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, 
1KI.20.23	Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their gods 
1KI.20.24	So do this thing: Dismiss the kings, each from his position, and put captains in their places; 
1KI.20.25	and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they.”
1KI.20.25	And he listened to their voice and did so.
1KI.20.26	So it was, in the spring of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to 
1KI.20.27	And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the 
1KI.20.28	Then a 
1KI.20.29	And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers 
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; then a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men 
1KI.20.30	And Ben-Hadad fled and went into the city, into an inner chamber.
1KI.20.31	Then his servants said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel 
1KI.20.32	So they wore sackcloth around their waists and 
1KI.20.32	And he said, “
1KI.20.33	Now the men were watching closely to see whether 
1KI.20.33	So he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-Hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot.
1KI.20.34	So 
1KI.20.34	Then 
1KI.20.35	Now a certain man of 
1KI.20.36	Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	And he found another man, and said, “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him, inflicting a wound. 
1KI.20.38	Then the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	Now 
1KI.20.40	While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.”
1KI.20.40	Then the king of Israel said to him, “So 
1KI.20.41	And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	Then he said to him, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.43	So the king of Israel 
1KI.21.1	And it came to pass after these things 
1KI.21.2	So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your 
1KI.21.3	But Naboth said to Ahab, “The 
1KI.21.4	So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food. 
1KI.21.5	But 
1KI.21.6	He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you 
1KI.21.7	Then Jezebel his wife said to him, “You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1KI.21.8	And she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed 
1KI.21.9	She wrote in the letters, saying,
1KI.21.9	Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with high honor among the people; 
1KI.21.10	and seat two men, scoundrels, before him to bear witness against him, saying, “You have 
1KI.21.11	So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth with high honor among the people. 
1KI.21.13	And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”
1KI.21.15	And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, 
1KI.21.19	You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the 
1KI.21.20	So Ahab said to Elijah, 
1KI.21.20	And he answered, “I have found 
1KI.21.21	‘Behold, 
1KI.21.22	I will make your house like the house of 
1KI.21.23	And 
1KI.21.24	The dogs shall eat 
1KI.21.25	But 
1KI.21.26	And he behaved very abominably in following idols, according to all 
1KI.21.27	So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and 
1KI.21.28	And the word of the 
1KI.21.29	“See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he 
1KI.22.1	Now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	Then it came to pass, in the third year, that 
1KI.22.3	And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that 
1KI.22.4	So he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead?”
1KI.22.4	Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, 
1KI.22.5	Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel 
1KI.22.6	So they said, “Go up, for the Lord will deliver 
1KI.22.7	And 
1KI.22.8	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “
1KI.22.8	And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say such things!”
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!”
1KI.22.10	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on 
1KI.22.11	Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the 
1KI.22.13	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak encouragement.”
1KI.22.14	And Micaiah said, “
1KI.22.15	Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain?”
1KI.22.15	And he answered him, “Go and prosper, for the 
1KI.22.16	So the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	Then he said, “I saw all Israel 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
1KI.22.19	Then 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	The 
1KI.22.23	Therefore look! The 
1KI.22.24	Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and 
1KI.22.25	And Micaiah said, “Indeed, you shall see on that day when you go into an 
1KI.22.26	So the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; 
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this 
1KI.22.28	But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel 
1KI.22.31	Now the 
1KI.22.32	So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “Surely it 
1KI.22.33	And it happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it 
1KI.22.34	Now a 
1KI.22.35	The battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	Then, as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the army, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his own country!”
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	Then 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab rested with his fathers. Then 
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat 
1KI.22.43	And 
1KI.22.44	Also 
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, 
1KI.22.46	And the rest of the perverted persons, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he banished from the land. 
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat 
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not.
1KI.22.50	And 
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.52	He did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.22.53	for 
2KI.1.1	Moab 
2KI.1.2	Now 
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore, thus says the 
2KI.1.5	And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, “Why have you come back?”
2KI.1.6	So they said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, “Thus says the 
2KI.1.7	Then he said to them, “What kind of man 
2KI.1.8	So they answered him, 
2KI.1.8	And he said, 
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. So he went up to him; and there he was, sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’ ”
2KI.1.10	So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, “If I 
2KI.1.11	Then he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty men.
2KI.1.11	And he answered and said to him: “Man of God, thus has the king said, ‘Come down quickly!’ ”
2KI.1.12	So Elijah answered and said to them, “If I 
2KI.1.13	Again, he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and said to him: “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours 
2KI.1.14	Look, fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your sight.”
2KI.1.15	And the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	Then he said to him, “Thus says the 
2KI.1.17	So 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, 
2KI.2.1	And it came to pass, when the 
2KI.2.2	Then Elijah said to Elisha, 
2KI.2.2	But Elisha said, “
2KI.2.3	Now 
2KI.2.3	And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”
2KI.2.4	Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, please, for the 
2KI.2.4	But he said, “
2KI.2.5	Now the sons of the prophets who 
2KI.2.5	So he answered, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, please, for the 
2KI.2.6	But he said, “
2KI.2.7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing 
2KI.2.8	Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled 
2KI.2.9	And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?”
2KI.2.9	Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.”
2KI.2.10	So he said, “You have asked a hard thing. 
2KI.2.11	Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly 
2KI.2.12	And Elisha saw 
2KI.2.13	He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, “Where 
2KI.2.15	Now when the sons of the prophets who 
2KI.2.16	Then they said to him, “Look now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, 
2KI.2.16	And he said, “You shall not send anyone.”
2KI.2.17	But when they urged him till he was 
2KI.2.18	And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”
2KI.2.19	Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please notice, the situation of this city 
2KI.2.20	And he said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought 
2KI.2.21	Then he went out to the source of the water, and 
2KI.2.22	So the water remains 
2KI.2.23	Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
2KI.2.24	So he turned around and looked at them, and 
2KI.2.25	Then he went from there to 
2KI.3.1	Now 
2KI.3.2	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he persisted in 
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he 
2KI.3.5	But it happened, when 
2KI.3.6	So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”
2KI.3.7	And he said, “I will go up; 
2KI.3.8	Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?”
2KI.3.8	And he answered, “By way of the Wilderness of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched on that roundabout route seven days; and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	And the king of Israel said, “Alas! For the 
2KI.3.11	But 
2KI.3.11	So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat 
2KI.3.12	And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the 
2KI.3.13	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, 
2KI.3.13	But the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the 
2KI.3.14	And Elisha said, 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me 
2KI.3.15	Then it happened, when the musician 
2KI.3.16	And he said, “Thus says the 
2KI.3.17	For thus says the 
2KI.3.18	And this is a simple matter in the sight of the 
2KI.3.19	Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”
2KI.3.20	Now it happened in the morning, when 
2KI.3.21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they stood at the border. 
2KI.3.22	Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side 
2KI.3.23	And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”
2KI.3.24	So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered 
2KI.3.25	Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of 
2KI.3.26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then 
2KI.4.1	A certain woman of the wives of 
2KI.4.2	So Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.”
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors—empty vessels; 
2KI.4.4	And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.”
2KI.4.5	So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought 
2KI.4.6	Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.”
2KI.4.6	And he said to her, “
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you 
2KI.4.8	Now it happened one day that Elisha went to 
2KI.4.9	And she said to her husband, “Look now, I know that this 
2KI.4.10	Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.”
2KI.4.11	And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there. 
2KI.4.12	Then he said to 
2KI.4.13	And he said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What 
2KI.4.13	She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”
2KI.4.14	So he said, “What then 
2KI.4.14	And Gehazi answered, “Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.”
2KI.4.15	So he said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	Then he said, “About this time next year you shall embrace a son.”
2KI.4.16	And she said, “No, my lord. Man of God, 
2KI.4.17	But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.
2KI.4.18	And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	And he said to his father, “My head, my head!”
2KI.4.19	So he said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and 
2KI.4.21	And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut 
2KI.4.22	Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.”
2KI.4.23	So he said, “Why are you going to him today? 
2KI.4.23	And she said, “
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	And so she departed, and went to the man of God 
2KI.4.25	So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, the Shunammite woman! 
2KI.4.26	Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘
2KI.4.26	And she answered, “
2KI.4.27	Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone; for her soul 
2KI.4.28	So she said, “Did I ask a son of my lord? 
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, 
2KI.4.30	And the mother of the child said, 
2KI.4.31	Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but 
2KI.4.32	When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	He 
2KI.4.34	And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and 
2KI.4.35	He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up 
2KI.4.36	And he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite woman.” So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, “Pick up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she 
2KI.4.38	And Elisha returned to 
2KI.4.39	So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced 
2KI.4.40	Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, “Man of God, 
2KI.4.41	So he said, “Then bring some flour.” And 
2KI.4.42	Then a man came from 
2KI.4.43	But his servant said, 
2KI.4.43	He said again, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the 
2KI.4.44	So he set 
2KI.5.1	Now 
2KI.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out 
2KI.5.3	Then she said to her mistress, “If only my master 
2KI.5.4	And 
2KI.5.5	Then the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”
2KI.5.5	So he departed and 
2KI.5.6	Then he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said,
2KI.5.6	Now be advised, when this letter comes to you, that I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.
2KI.5.7	And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, “
2KI.5.8	So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
2KI.5.9	Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house. 
2KI.5.10	And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out 
2KI.5.12	 not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage. 
2KI.5.13	And his 
2KI.5.14	So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his 
2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that 
2KI.5.16	But he said, 
2KI.5.17	So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the 
2KI.5.18	Yet in this thing may the 
2KI.5.19	Then he said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him a short distance.
2KI.5.20	But 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw 
2KI.5.22	And he said, “All 
2KI.5.23	So Naaman said, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed 
2KI.5.24	When he came to the citadel, he took 
2KI.5.25	Now he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where 
2KI.5.25	And he said, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”
2KI.5.26	Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go 
2KI.5.27	Therefore the leprosy of Naaman 
2KI.6.1	And 
2KI.6.2	Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.”
2KI.6.2	So he answered, “Go.”
2KI.6.3	Then one said, 
2KI.6.3	And he answered, “I will go.” 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron 
2KI.6.6	So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So 
2KI.6.7	Therefore he said, “Pick 
2KI.6.8	Now the 
2KI.6.9	And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.” 
2KI.6.10	Then the king of Israel sent 
2KI.6.11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me which of us 
2KI.6.12	And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who 
2KI.6.13	So he said, “Go and see where he 
2KI.6.13	And it was told him, saying, “Surely 
2KI.6.14	Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. 
2KI.6.15	And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
2KI.6.16	So he answered, 
2KI.6.17	And Elisha prayed, and said, “
2KI.6.18	So when 
2KI.6.19	Now Elisha said to them, “This 
2KI.6.20	So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, “
2KI.6.21	Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “My 
2KI.6.22	But he answered, “You shall not kill 
2KI.6.23	Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So 
2KI.6.24	And it happened after this that 
2KI.6.25	And there was a great 
2KI.6.26	Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”
2KI.6.27	And he said, “If the 
2KI.6.28	Then the king said to her, “What is troubling you?”
2KI.6.28	And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So 
2KI.6.30	Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, 
2KI.6.32	But Elisha was sitting in his house, and 
2KI.6.33	And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then 
2KI.7.1	Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.7.2	So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, “Look, 
2KI.7.2	And he said, “In fact, you shall see 
2KI.7.3	Now there were four leprous men 
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘We will enter the city,’ the famine 
2KI.7.5	And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians 
2KI.7.7	Therefore they 
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid 
2KI.7.9	Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day 
2KI.7.10	So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, “We went to the Syrian camp, and surprisingly no one 
2KI.7.11	And the gatekeepers called out, and they told 
2KI.7.12	So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, “Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we 
2KI.7.13	And one of his servants answered and said, “Please, let several 
2KI.7.14	Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.” 
2KI.7.15	And they went after them to the Jordan; and indeed all the road 
2KI.7.16	Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was 
2KI.7.17	Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just 
2KI.7.18	So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, 
2KI.7.19	Then that officer had answered the man of God, and said, “Now look, 
2KI.7.19	And he had said, “In fact, you shall see 
2KI.7.20	And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Then Elisha spoke to the woman 
2KI.8.2	So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2KI.8.3	It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land. 
2KI.8.4	Then the king talked with 
2KI.8.5	Now it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that there was the woman whose son he had 
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him.
2KI.8.6	So the king appointed a certain officer for her, saying, “Restore all that 
2KI.8.7	Then Elisha went to Damascus, and 
2KI.8.8	And the king said to 
2KI.8.9	So 
2KI.8.10	And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover.’ However the 
2KI.8.11	Then he set his countenance in a stare until he was ashamed; and the man of God 
2KI.8.12	And Hazael said, “Why is my lord weeping?”
2KI.8.12	He answered, “Because I know 
2KI.8.13	So Hazael said, “But what 
2KI.8.13	And Elisha answered, 
2KI.8.14	Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me you would surely recover.” 
2KI.8.15	But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped 
2KI.8.16	Now 
2KI.8.17	He was 
2KI.8.18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for 
2KI.8.19	Yet the 
2KI.8.20	In his days 
2KI.8.21	So Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. Then he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; and the troops fled to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. 
2KI.8.23	Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, 
2KI.8.24	So Joram rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then 
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah 
2KI.8.27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.28	Now he went 
2KI.8.29	Then 
2KI.9.1	And Elisha the prophet called one of 
2KI.9.2	Now when you arrive at that place, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among 
2KI.9.3	Then 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.5	And when he arrived, there 
2KI.9.5	Jehu said, “For which 
2KI.9.5	And he said, “For you, Commander.” 
2KI.9.6	Then he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, 
2KI.9.7	You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and 
2KI.9.9	So I will make the house of Ahab like the house of 
2KI.9.10	The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot 
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and 
2KI.9.11	And he said to them, “You know the man and his babble.”
2KI.9.12	And they said, “A lie! Tell us now.”
2KI.9.12	So he said, “Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the 
2KI.9.13	Then each man hastened 
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against 
2KI.9.15	But 
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was laid up there; 
2KI.9.17	Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company of men.”
2KI.9.17	And Joram said, “Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, ‘
2KI.9.18	So the horseman went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘
2KI.9.18	And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.”
2KI.9.18	So the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went to them, but is not coming back.”
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘
2KI.9.19	And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.”
2KI.9.20	So the watchman reported, saying, “He went up to them and is not coming back; and the driving 
2KI.9.21	Then Joram said, “Make ready.” And his chariot was made ready. Then 
2KI.9.22	Now it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, “
2KI.9.22	So he answered, “What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft 
2KI.9.23	Then Joram turned around and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!” 
2KI.9.24	Now Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then 
2KI.9.26	‘Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the 
2KI.9.27	But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw 
2KI.9.28	And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David. 
2KI.9.29	In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.
2KI.9.30	Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard 
2KI.9.31	Then, as Jehu entered at the gate, she said, 
2KI.9.32	And he looked up at the window, and said, “Who 
2KI.9.33	Then he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and 
2KI.9.34	And when he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “Go now, see to this accursed 
2KI.9.35	So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of

2KI.10.6	If you 
2KI.10.6	Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, 
2KI.10.7	So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons and 
2KI.10.8	Then a messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
2KI.10.8	And he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”
2KI.10.9	So it was, in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You

2KI.10.12	And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth Eked of the Shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who

2KI.10.15	Now when he departed from there, he met 
2KI.10.15	And Jehonadab answered, “It is.”
2KI.10.16	Then he said, “Come with me, and see my

2KI.10.18	Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, 
2KI.10.19	Now therefore, call to me all the

2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the temple of Baal, and the 
2KI.10.22	And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them. 
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that no servants of the

2KI.10.29	However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, 
2KI.10.30	And the

2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead—Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from 
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, 
2KI.10.35	So Jehu rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then 
2KI.10.36	And the period that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria 
2KI.11.1	When 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of 
2KI.11.3	So he was hidden with her in the house of the

2KI.11.5	Then he commanded them, saying, “This 
2KI.11.6	one-third 
2KI.11.7	The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the 
2KI.11.8	But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.”
2KI.11.9	So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which 
2KI.11.11	Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house. 
2KI.11.12	And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and 
2KI.11.13	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts 
2KI.11.14	When she looked, there was the king standing by 
2KI.11.15	And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of the

2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada 
2KI.11.18	And all the people of the land went to the 
2KI.11.19	Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the 
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword 
2KI.11.21	Jehoash 
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu, 
2KI.12.2	Jehoash did 
2KI.12.3	But 
2KI.12.4	And Jehoash said to the priests, 
2KI.12.5	let the priests take 
2KI.12.6	Now it was so, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, 
2KI.12.7	So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the 
2KI.12.8	And the priests agreed that they would neither receive 
2KI.12.9	Then Jehoiada the priest took 
2KI.12.10	So it was, whenever they saw that 
2KI.12.11	Then they gave the money, which had been apportioned, into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.12.12	and to masons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone, to 
2KI.12.13	However 
2KI.12.14	But they gave that to the workmen, and they repaired the house of the 
2KI.12.15	Moreover 
2KI.12.16	The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.17	Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; then 
2KI.12.18	And Jehoash king of Judah 
2KI.12.19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, 
2KI.12.20	And 
2KI.12.21	For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. Then 
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of 
2KI.13.2	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.3	Then 
2KI.13.4	So Jehoahaz 
2KI.13.5	Then the 
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin, 
2KI.13.7	For He left of the army of Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them 
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, all that he did, and his might, 
2KI.13.9	So Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then Joash his son reigned in his place.
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.13.11	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.12	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, 
2KI.13.13	So Joash 
2KI.13.14	Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, 
2KI.13.15	And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” So he took himself a bow and some arrows. 
2KI.13.16	Then he said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” So he put his hand 
2KI.13.17	And he said, “Open the east window”; and he opened 
2KI.13.18	Then he said, “Take the arrows”; so he took 
2KI.13.19	And the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed 
2KI.13.20	Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the 
2KI.13.21	So it was, as they were burying a man, that suddenly they spied a band 
2KI.13.22	And 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	Now Hazael king of Syria died. Then Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his place. 
2KI.13.25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. 
2KI.14.1	In 
2KI.14.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	And he did 
2KI.14.4	However the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2KI.14.5	Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he executed his servants 
2KI.14.6	But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which the 
2KI.14.7	He killed ten thousand Edomites in 
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another 
2KI.14.9	And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed defeated Edom, and 
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not heed. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at 
2KI.14.12	And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. 
2KI.14.13	Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and he went to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from

2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	Nevertheless they would not hear, but 
2KI.17.15	And they 
2KI.17.16	So they left all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, 
2KI.17.18	Therefore the 
2KI.17.19	Also 
2KI.17.20	And the 
2KI.17.21	For 
2KI.17.22	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them, 
2KI.17.23	until the

2KI.17.25	And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, 
2KI.17.26	So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land.” 
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land.” 
2KI.17.28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	However every nation continued to make gods of its own, and put 
2KI.17.30	The men of 
2KI.17.31	and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites 
2KI.17.32	So they feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	To this day they continue practicing the former rituals; they do not fear the 
2KI.17.35	with whom the 
2KI.17.36	but the 
2KI.17.37	And the statutes, the ordinances, the law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, 
2KI.17.38	And the covenant that I have made with you, 
2KI.17.39	But the 
2KI.17.40	However they did not obey, but they followed their former rituals. 
2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the

2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name 
2KI.18.3	And he did 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places and broke the

2KI.18.6	For he 
2KI.18.7	The 
2KI.18.8	He subdued the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory, 
2KI.18.9	Now 
2KI.18.10	And at the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that 
2KI.18.11	Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria, and put them 
2KI.18.12	because they 
2KI.18.13	And 
2KI.18.14	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; turn away from me; whatever you impose on me I will pay.” And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	So Hezekiah 
2KI.18.16	At that time Hezekiah stripped 
2KI.18.17	Then the king of Assyria sent 
2KI.18.18	And when they had called to the king, 
2KI.18.19	Then 
2KI.18.20	You speak of 
2KI.18.21	Now look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So 
2KI.18.22	But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the 
2KI.18.23	Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them! 
2KI.18.24	How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	Have I now come up without the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to 
2KI.18.27	But 
2KI.18.28	Then 
2KI.18.29	Thus says the king: 
2KI.18.30	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
2KI.18.31	Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make 
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, 
2KI.18.33	Has any of the gods of the nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where 
2KI.18.35	Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their countries from my hand, 
2KI.18.36	But the people held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who 
2KI.19.1	And 
2KI.19.2	Then he sent Eliakim, who 
2KI.19.3	And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day 
2KI.19.4	It may be that the 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
2KI.19.6	And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the 
2KI.19.7	Surely I will send 
2KI.19.8	Then 
2KI.19.9	And 
2KI.19.10	“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God 
2KI.19.11	Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of 
2KI.19.13	Where 
2KI.19.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the 
2KI.19.15	Then Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	Incline Your ear, O 
2KI.19.17	Truly, 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they 
2KI.19.19	Now therefore, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the 
2KI.19.21	This 
2KI.19.21	‘The virgin, 
2KI.19.21	Has despised you, laughed you to scorn;

2KI.20.8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, 
2KI.20.9	Then Isaiah said, 
2KI.20.10	And Hezekiah answered, “It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees; no, but let the shadow go backward ten degrees.”
2KI.20.11	So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	And 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?”
2KI.20.14	So Hezekiah said, “They came from a far country, from Babylon.”
2KI.20.15	And he said, “What have they seen in your house?”
2KI.20.15	So Hezekiah answered,

2KI.21.16	Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the

2KI.21.18	So 
2KI.21.19	Amon 
2KI.21.20	And he did evil in the sight of the

2KI.22.1	Josiah 
2KI.22.2	And he did 
2KI.22.3	Now it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been 
2KI.22.5	And let them 
2KI.22.6	to carpenters and builders and masons—and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 
2KI.22.7	However 
2KI.22.8	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, 
2KI.22.9	So Shaphan the scribe went to the king, bringing the king word, saying, “Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work, who oversee the house of the

2KI.22.11	Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, 
2KI.22.13	“Go, inquire of the

2KI.23.2	The king went up to the house of the

2KI.23.4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the 
2KI.23.5	Then he removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to 
2KI.23.6	And he brought out the 
2KI.23.7	Then he tore down the 
2KI.23.8	And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from 
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the

2KI.23.11	Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the 
2KI.23.12	The altars that

2KI.23.14	And he 
2KI.23.15	Moreover the altar that 
2KI.23.16	As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs that

2KI.23.17	So the men of the city told him, “
2KI.23.18	And he said, “Let him alone; let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of

2KI.23.20	He 
2KI.23.21	Then the king commanded all the people, saying, 
2KI.23.22	Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was held before the 
2KI.23.24	Moreover Josiah put away those who consulted mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might perform the words of 
2KI.23.25	Now before him there was no king like him, who turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Nevertheless the 
2KI.23.27	And the 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went to the aid of the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him. And 
2KI.23.30	Then his servants moved his body in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And 
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz 
2KI.23.32	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.23.33	Now Pharaoh Necho put him in prison 
2KI.23.34	Then 
2KI.23.35	So Jehoiakim gave 
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim 
2KI.23.37	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.1	In 
2KI.24.2	And the 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the commandment of the 
2KI.24.4	and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
2KI.24.7	And 
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin 
2KI.24.9	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 
2KI.24.11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, as his servants were besieging it. 
2KI.24.12	Then Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officers went out to the king of Babylon; and the king of Babylon, 
2KI.24.13	And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the

2KI.24.15	And 
2KI.24.16	All the valiant men, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all 
2KI.24.17	Then 
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah 
2KI.24.19	He also did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.20	For because of the anger of the 
2KI.25.1	Now it came to pass 
2KI.25.2	So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.3	By the ninth 
2KI.25.4	Then 
2KI.25.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon 
2KI.25.7	Then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, 
2KI.25.8	And in the fifth month, 
2KI.25.9	He burned the house of the

2KI.25.18	And the captain of the guard took 
2KI.25.19	He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, 
2KI.25.20	So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. 
2KI.25.22	Then he made Gedaliah the son of

2KI.25.25	But 
2KI.25.26	And all the people, small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose

1CH.12.14	These 
1CH.12.15	These 
1CH.12.16	Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. 
1CH.12.17	And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies, since 
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came upon

1CH.12.18	And peace to your helpers!
1CH.12.18	For your God helps you.”
1CH.12.18	So David received them, and made them captains of the troop.
1CH.12.19	And 
1CH.12.20	When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who defected to him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands who 
1CH.12.21	And they helped David against

1CH.12.31	of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name to come and make David king; 
1CH.12.32	of the sons of Issachar 
1CH.12.33	of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who went out to battle, expert in war with all weapons of war,

1CH.12.38	All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a loyal heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel 
1CH.12.39	And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and oxen—provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly, for 
1CH.13.1	Then David consulted with the 
1CH.13.2	And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If 
1CH.13.3	and let us bring the ark of our God back to us, 
1CH.13.4	Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.5	So 
1CH.13.6	And David and all Israel went up to 
1CH.13.7	So they carried the ark of God 
1CH.13.8	Then 
1CH.13.9	And when they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	Then the anger of the 
1CH.13.11	And David became angry because of the 
1CH.13.12	David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God to me?”
1CH.13.13	So David would not move the ark with him into the City of David, but took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the 
1CH.14.1	Now 
1CH.14.2	So David knew that the 
1CH.14.3	Then David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	And 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	Now when the Philistines heard that 
1CH.14.9	Then the Philistines went and made a raid 
1CH.14.10	And David 
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. Then David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.” Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim. 
1CH.14.12	And when they left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
1CH.14.13	Then the Philistines once again made a raid on the valley. 
1CH.14.14	Therefore David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; circle around them, 
1CH.14.15	And it shall be, when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” 
1CH.14.16	So David did as God commanded him, and they drove back the army of the Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	Then 
1CH.15.1	 built houses for himself in the City of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one may carry the 
1CH.15.3	And David 
1CH.15.4	Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.8	of the sons of 
1CH.15.9	of the sons of 
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brethren.
1CH.15.11	And David called for 
1CH.15.12	He said to them, “You 
1CH.15.13	For 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as 
1CH.15.16	Then David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed 
1CH.15.18	and with them their brethren of the second 
1CH.15.19	the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with strings according to 
1CH.15.21	Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to direct with harps on the 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was instructor 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah 
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, 
1CH.15.25	So 
1CH.15.26	And so it was, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	David was clothed with a robe of fine 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	And it happened, 
1CH.16.1	So 
1CH.16.2	And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, 
1CH.16.3	Then he distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece 
1CH.16.4	And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, 
1CH.16.6	Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests regularly 
1CH.16.7	On that day 
1CH.16.8	Oh, give thanks to the

1CH.16.18	Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
1CH.16.18	As the allotment of your inheritance,”
1CH.16.19	When you were 
1CH.16.19	Indeed very few, and strangers in it.
1CH.16.20	When they went from one nation to another,
1CH.16.20	And from 
1CH.16.21	He permitted no man to do them wrong;

1CH.16.30	It shall not be moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;
1CH.16.31	And let them say among the nations, “The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and all its fullness;
1CH.16.32	Let the field rejoice, and all that 
1CH.16.33	Then the

1CH.16.34	For His mercy 
1CH.16.35	And say, “Save us, O God of our salvation;
1CH.16.35	Gather us together, and deliver us from the Gentiles,
1CH.16.35	To give thanks to Your holy name,
1CH.16.35	To triumph in Your praise.”
1CH.16.36	Blessed 
1CH.16.36	From everlasting to everlasting!
1CH.16.36	And all 
1CH.16.37	So he left 
1CH.16.38	and 
1CH.16.39	and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests, 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings to the 
1CH.16.41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and the musical instruments of God. Now the sons of Jeduthun 
1CH.16.43	Then all the people departed, every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
1CH.17.1	Now 
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that 
1CH.17.3	But it happened that night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the 
1CH.17.5	For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought up Israel, even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from 
1CH.17.6	Wherever I have moved about with all Israel, have I ever spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar–’ ” ’ 
1CH.17.7	Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the 
1CH.17.8	And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men who 
1CH.17.9	Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will 
1CH.17.10	since the time that I commanded judges 
1CH.17.11	And it shall be, when your days are 
1CH.17.12	He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, 
1CH.17.14	And 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	And 
1CH.17.18	What more can David 
1CH.17.19	O 
1CH.17.20	O 
1CH.17.21	And who 
1CH.17.22	For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, 
1CH.17.23	“And now, O 
1CH.17.24	So let it be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, ‘The 
1CH.17.25	For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found it 
1CH.17.26	And now, 
1CH.17.27	Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You have blessed it, O 
1CH.18.1	After this 
1CH.18.2	Then he defeated 
1CH.18.3	And 
1CH.18.4	David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Also David hamstrung all the chariot 
1CH.18.5	When the 
1CH.18.6	Then David put 
1CH.18.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	Also from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought a large amount of 
1CH.18.9	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou); and 
1CH.18.11	King David also dedicated these to the 
1CH.18.12	Moreover 
1CH.18.13	He also put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And the 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel, and administered judgment and justice to all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab the son of Zeruiah 
1CH.18.16	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar 
1CH.18.17	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada 
1CH.19.1	It
1CH.19.2	Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the people of Ammon to comfort him.
1CH.19.3	And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Did his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”
1CH.19.4	Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their 
1CH.19.5	Then 
1CH.19.6	When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the people of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Syrian Maacah, 
1CH.19.7	So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. Also the people of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle.
1CH.19.8	Now when David heard 
1CH.19.9	Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before the gate of the city, and the kings who had come 
1CH.19.10	When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s best and put 
1CH.19.11	And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother, and they set 
1CH.19.12	Then he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people who 
1CH.19.15	When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab went to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	Now when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond the River, and Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army 
1CH.19.17	When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan and came upon them, and set up in 
1CH.19.18	Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians, and killed Shophach the commander of the army. 
1CH.19.19	And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants. So the Syrians were not willing to help the people of Ammon anymore.
1CH.20.1	It
1CH.20.2	Then David 
1CH.20.3	And he brought out the people who 
1CH.20.4	Now it happened afterward 
1CH.20.5	Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear 
1CH.20.6	Yet again 
1CH.20.7	So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
1CH.20.8	These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	Now 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, 
1CH.21.3	And Joab answered, “May the 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel 
1CH.21.6	But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
1CH.21.7	And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel. 
1CH.21.8	So David said to God, 
1CH.21.9	Then the 
1CH.21.10	“Go and tell David, 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the 
1CH.21.12	either three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking 
1CH.21.13	And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an 
1CH.21.16	Then David lifted his eyes and 
1CH.21.17	And David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these 
1CH.21.18	Therefore, the 
1CH.21.19	So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons 
1CH.21.21	So David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed before David with 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the place of 
1CH.21.23	But Ornan said to David, “Take 
1CH.21.24	Then King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy 
1CH.21.25	So 
1CH.21.26	And David built there an altar to the 
1CH.21.27	So the 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, 
1CH.22.2	So David commanded to gather the 
1CH.22.3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance 
1CH.22.4	and cedar trees in abundance; for the 
1CH.22.5	Now David said, 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	And David said to Solomon: “My son, as for me, 
1CH.22.8	but the word of the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him 
1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for My name, and 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, may 
1CH.22.12	Only may the 
1CH.22.13	Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments with which the 
1CH.22.14	Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	Moreover 
1CH.22.16	Of gold and silver and bronze and iron 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the 
1CH.22.18	“
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the 
1CH.23.1	So when David was old and full of days, he made his son 
1CH.23.2	And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

1CH.29.1	Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: “My son Solomon, whom alone God has 
1CH.29.2	Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for 
1CH.29.3	Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, my own special treasure of gold and silver:

1CH.29.8	And whoever had 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a loyal heart they had 
1CH.29.10	Therefore David blessed the

1CH.29.14	For all things 
1CH.29.14	And of Your own we have given You.
1CH.29.15	For 
1CH.29.15	As 
1CH.29.15	Our days on earth 
1CH.29.15	And without hope.
1CH.29.16	“O 
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that You 
1CH.29.18	O 
1CH.29.19	And

1CH.29.22	So they ate and drank before the 
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, 
1CH.29.25	So the 
1CH.29.26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	And the period that he reigned over Israel 
1CH.29.28	So he 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of King David, first and last, indeed they 
1CH.29.30	with all his reign and his might, 
2CH.1.1	Now 
2CH.1.2	And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to 
2CH.1.3	Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that 
2CH.1.4	But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to 
2CH.1.5	Now 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the 
2CH.1.7	On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask! What shall I give you?”
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great 
2CH.1.9	Now, O 
2CH.1.10	Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may 
2CH.1.11	Then God said to Solomon: “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king— 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge 
2CH.1.13	So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that 
2CH.1.14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which 
2CH.1.16	And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the 
2CH.1.17	They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred 
2CH.2.1	Then Solomon 
2CH.2.2	Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry 
2CH.2.3	Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying:
2CH.2.3	As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, 
2CH.2.4	Behold, 
2CH.2.5	And the temple which I build 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build Him a temple, since heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who 
2CH.2.7	Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and blue, who has skill to engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, 
2CH.2.8	Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants 
2CH.2.9	to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the temple which I am about to build 
2CH.2.10	And indeed I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2CH.2.11	Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon:
2CH.2.11	Because the 
2CH.2.12	Hiram also said:
2CH.2.12	Blessed 
2CH.2.13	And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram my master 
2CH.2.14	(the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.
2CH.2.15	Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which 
2CH.2.16	And we will cut wood from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.
2CH.2.17	Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who 
2CH.2.18	And he made 
2CH.3.1	Now 
2CH.3.2	And he began to build on the second 
2CH.3.3	This is the foundation 
2CH.3.4	And the 
2CH.3.5	The larger room he 
2CH.3.6	And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold 
2CH.3.7	He also overlaid the house—the beams and doorposts, its walls and doors—with gold; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	And he made the 
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails 
2CH.3.10	In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim, fashioned by carving, and overlaid them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	The wings of the cherubim 
2CH.3.12	 wing of the other cherub 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim spanned twenty cubits overall. They stood on their feet, and they faced inward. 
2CH.3.14	And he made the 
2CH.3.15	Also he made in front of the temple 
2CH.3.16	He made wreaths of chainwork, as in the inner sanctuary, and put 
2CH.3.17	Then he 
2CH.4.1	Moreover he made 
2CH.4.2	Then he made the Sea of cast 
2CH.4.3	And under it 
2CH.4.4	It stood on twelve 
2CH.4.5	It 
2CH.4.6	He also made 
2CH.4.7	And he made ten lampstands of gold 
2CH.4.8	He also made ten tables, and placed 
2CH.4.9	Furthermore 
2CH.4.10	He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast.
2CH.4.11	Then 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars and 
2CH.4.13	four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that 
2CH.4.14	he also made 
2CH.4.15	one Sea and twelve oxen under it; 
2CH.4.16	also the pots, the shovels, the forks—and all their articles 
2CH.4.17	In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	And Solomon had all these articles made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
2CH.4.19	Thus 
2CH.4.20	the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn 
2CH.4.21	with 
2CH.4.22	the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold. As for the entry of the sanctuary, its inner doors to the Most Holy 
2CH.5.1	So 
2CH.5.2	Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.3	Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king 
2CH.5.4	So all the elders of Israel came, and the 
2CH.5.5	Then they brought up the ark, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that 
2CH.5.6	Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. 
2CH.5.7	Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	For the cherubim spread 
2CH.5.9	The poles extended so that the ends of the 
2CH.5.10	Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses 
2CH.5.11	And it came to pass when the priests came out of the

2CH.6.1	“The 
2CH.6.2	I have surely built You an exalted house,
2CH.6.2	And 
2CH.6.3	Then the king turned around and 
2CH.6.4	And he said: “Blessed 
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel 
2CH.6.6	Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there, and I

2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	Nevertheless you shall not build the temple, but your son who will come from your body, he shall build the temple for My 
2CH.6.10	So the 
2CH.6.11	And there I have put the ark, 
2CH.6.12	Then 
2CH.6.13	(for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven); 
2CH.6.14	and he said: “

2CH.6.18	“But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? 
2CH.6.19	Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O 
2CH.6.20	that Your eyes may be

2CH.6.32	“Moreover, concerning a foreigner, 
2CH.6.33	then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as 
2CH.6.34	“When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name,

2CH.6.36	“When they sin against You (for

2CH.6.38	and 
2CH.6.39	then hear from heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You. 
2CH.6.40	Now, my God, I pray, let Your eyes be

2CH.6.42	Remember the mercies of Your servant David.”
2CH.7.1	When 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter the house of the 
2CH.7.3	When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the 
2CH.7.3	“For 
2CH.7.3	For His mercy 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
2CH.7.6	And the priests attended to their services; the Levites also with instruments of the music of the 
2CH.7.7	Furthermore 
2CH.7.8	At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly 
2CH.7.9	And on the eighth day they held a 
2CH.7.10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the

2CH.7.12	Then the 
2CH.7.13	When I shut up heaven and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people, 
2CH.7.14	if My people who are 
2CH.7.15	Now 
2CH.7.16	For now 
2CH.7.17	As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments, 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, 
2CH.7.19	“But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them, 
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and will make it a proverb and a 
2CH.7.21	“And 
2CH.7.22	Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.1	It 
2CH.8.2	that the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he settled the children of Israel there. 
2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it. 
2CH.8.4	He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in 
2CH.8.5	He built Upper Beth Horon and 
2CH.8.6	also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the cavalry, and all that Solomon 
2CH.8.7	All the people 
2CH.8.8	that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel did not destroy—from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not make the children of Israel servants for his work. Some 
2CH.8.10	And others 
2CH.8.11	Now Solomon 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the 
2CH.8.13	according to the 
2CH.8.14	And, according to the order of David his father, he appointed the 
2CH.8.15	They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the 
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered from the day of the foundation of the house of the 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to 
2CH.8.18	And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to 
2CH.9.1	Now 
2CH.9.2	So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for Solomon that he could not explain it to her. 
2CH.9.3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his 
2CH.9.5	Then she said to the king: “
2CH.9.6	However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame of which I heard. 
2CH.9.7	Happy 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there never were any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
2CH.9.10	Also, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, 
2CH.9.11	And the king made walkways 
2CH.9.12	Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, 
2CH.9.13	The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
2CH.9.14	besides 
2CH.9.15	And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred 
2CH.9.16	 also 
2CH.9.17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne 
2CH.9.19	Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels 
2CH.9.21	For the king’s ships went to 
2CH.9.22	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, 
2CH.9.25	Solomon 
2CH.9.26	So he reigned over all the kings 
2CH.9.27	The king made silver 
2CH.9.28	And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, 
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
2CH.10.1	And 
2CH.10.2	So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard 
2CH.10.3	Then they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”
2CH.10.5	So he said to them, “Come back to me after three days.” And the people departed.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, “How do you advise 
2CH.10.7	And they spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
2CH.10.8	But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. 
2CH.10.9	And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”
2CH.10.10	Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make 
2CH.10.11	And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.12	So 
2CH.10.13	Then the king answered them roughly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders, 
2CH.10.14	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people; 
2CH.10.16	Now when all Israel 
2CH.10.16	“What share have we in David?
2CH.10.16	Every man to your tents, O Israel!
2CH.10.16	Now see to your own house, O David!”
2CH.10.16	So all Israel departed to their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who 
2CH.10.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2CH.11.1	Now 
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
2CH.11.4	‘Thus says the 
2CH.11.5	So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities. 
2CH.11.11	And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	Also in every city 
2CH.11.13	And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who 
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left 
2CH.11.15	Then he appointed for himself priests for the high places, for 
2CH.11.16	And after 
2CH.11.17	So they 
2CH.11.18	Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, 
2CH.11.19	And she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her he took 
2CH.11.21	Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his 
2CH.11.22	And Rehoboam 
2CH.11.23	He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every 
2CH.12.1	Now 
2CH.12.2	And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam 
2CH.12.3	with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt—
2CH.12.4	And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Then 
2CH.12.6	So the leaders of Israel and the king 
2CH.12.7	Now when the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless 
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.12.10	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed 
2CH.12.11	And whenever the king entered the house of the 
2CH.12.12	When he humbled himself, the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, 
2CH.12.16	So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. Then 
2CH.13.1	In 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name 
2CH.13.2	And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.
2CH.13.4	Then Abijah stood on Mount 
2CH.13.5	Should you not know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and 
2CH.13.7	Then 
2CH.13.8	And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Have you not cast out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	And they burn to the 
2CH.13.12	Now look, God Himself is with us as 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush 
2CH.13.14	And when Judah looked around, to their surprise the battle line 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God 
2CH.13.16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children of Judah prevailed, 
2CH.13.19	And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and 
2CH.13.20	So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings 
2CH.14.1	So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then 
2CH.14.2	Asa did 
2CH.14.3	for he removed the altars of the foreign 
2CH.14.4	He commanded Judah to 
2CH.14.5	He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet under him. 
2CH.14.6	And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because the 
2CH.14.7	Therefore he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and make walls around 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew 
2CH.14.9	Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to 
2CH.14.10	So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	And Asa 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	And Asa and the people who 
2CH.14.14	Then they defeated all the cities around Gerar, for 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the livestock enclosures, and carried off sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	Now 
2CH.15.2	And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.15.3	For a long time Israel 
2CH.15.4	but 
2CH.15.5	And in those times 
2CH.15.6	So nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every adversity. 
2CH.15.7	But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded!”
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities 
2CH.15.9	Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and 
2CH.15.10	So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.15.11	And they offered to the 
2CH.15.12	Then they 
2CH.15.13	and whoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	Then they took an oath before the 
2CH.15.15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and 
2CH.15.16	Also he removed 
2CH.15.17	But 
2CH.15.18	He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the 
2CH.16.3	“
2CH.16.4	So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	Now it happened, when Baasha heard 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	And at that time 
2CH.16.8	Were 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer, and 
2CH.16.11	Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he 
2CH.16.13	So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	They buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled 
2CH.17.1	Then 
2CH.17.2	And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of 
2CH.17.3	Now the 
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the 
2CH.17.6	And his heart took delight in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, 
2CH.17.8	And with them 
2CH.17.9	So they taught in Judah, and 
2CH.17.10	And 
2CH.17.11	Also 
2CH.17.12	So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. 
2CH.17.13	He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, 
2CH.17.14	These 
2CH.17.15	and next to him 
2CH.17.16	and next to him 
2CH.17.17	Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield; 
2CH.17.18	and next to him 
2CH.17.19	These served the king, besides 
2CH.18.1	Jehoshaphat 
2CH.18.2	After some years he went down to 
2CH.18.3	So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me 
2CH.18.3	And he answered him, “I 
2CH.18.4	Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, 
2CH.18.5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”
2CH.18.5	So they said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, “
2CH.18.7	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “
2CH.18.7	And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say such things!”
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel called one 
2CH.18.9	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in 
2CH.18.10	Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the 
2CH.18.12	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Therefore please let your word be like 
2CH.18.13	And Micaiah said, “
2CH.18.14	Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”
2CH.18.14	And he said, “Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!”
2CH.18.15	So the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	Then he said, “I saw all Israel 
2CH.18.17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
2CH.18.18	Then 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.20	Then a 
2CH.18.21	So he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And 
2CH.18.22	Therefore look! 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and 
2CH.18.24	And Micaiah said, “Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!”
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘Thus says the king: 
2CH.18.27	But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who 
2CH.18.31	So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “It 
2CH.18.32	For so it was, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped 
2CH.19.1	Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	And Jehu the son of Hanani 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless 
2CH.19.4	So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to the 
2CH.19.5	Then he set 
2CH.19.6	and said to the judges, “Take heed to what you are doing, for 
2CH.19.7	Now therefore, let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of the 
2CH.19.9	And he commanded them, saying, “Thus you shall act 
2CH.19.10	Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, lest they trespass against the 
2CH.19.11	And take notice: 
2CH.20.1	It happened after this 
2CH.20.2	Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are 
2CH.20.3	And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to 
2CH.20.4	So Judah gathered together to ask 
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the 
2CH.20.6	and said: “O 
2CH.20.7	 You not 
2CH.20.8	And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If disaster comes upon us—sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your 
2CH.20.10	And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir—whom You 
2CH.20.11	here they are, rewarding us 
2CH.20.12	O our God, will You not 
2CH.20.13	Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the 
2CH.20.14	Then 
2CH.20.15	And he said, “Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You will not 
2CH.20.18	And Jehoshaphat 
2CH.20.19	Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: 
2CH.20.21	And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the 
2CH.20.21	“Praise the 
2CH.20.21	For His mercy 
2CH.20.22	Now when they began to sing and to praise, 
2CH.20.23	For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy 
2CH.20.24	So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. 
2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the 
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the 
2CH.20.28	So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the 
2CH.20.29	And 
2CH.20.30	Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his 
2CH.20.31	So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. 
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of his father 
2CH.20.33	Nevertheless 
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they 
2CH.20.35	After this 
2CH.20.36	And he allied himself with him 
2CH.20.37	But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	And 
2CH.21.2	He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these 
2CH.21.3	Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he 
2CH.21.4	Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram 
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of 
2CH.21.7	Yet the 
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over themselves. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. 
2CH.21.10	Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. At that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to 
2CH.21.12	And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
2CH.21.12	Thus says the 
2CH.21.12	Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have 
2CH.21.14	behold, the 
2CH.21.15	and you 
2CH.21.16	Moreover the 
2CH.21.17	And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, and also 
2CH.21.18	After all this the 
2CH.21.19	Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain. And his people made no burning for him, like 
2CH.21.20	He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, to no one’s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.1	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother advised him to do wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	Therefore he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	He also followed their advice, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2CH.22.6	Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2CH.22.7	His going to Joram 
2CH.22.8	And it happened, when Jehu was 
2CH.22.9	Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, “because,” they said, “he is the son of 
2CH.22.9	So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom.
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took 
2CH.22.12	And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	In 
2CH.23.2	And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the 
2CH.23.3	Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	This 
2CH.23.5	one-third 
2CH.23.6	But let no one come into the house of the 
2CH.23.7	And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going 
2CH.23.9	And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small 
2CH.23.10	Then he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and by the temple, all around the king. 
2CH.23.11	And they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, 
2CH.23.12	Now when 
2CH.23.13	 she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the leaders and the trumpeters 
2CH.23.14	And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not kill her in the house of the 
2CH.23.15	So they seized her; and she went by way of the entrance 
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made a 
2CH.23.17	And all the people went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and 
2CH.23.18	Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the 
2CH.23.19	And he set the 
2CH.23.20	Then he took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash 
2CH.24.2	Joash 
2CH.24.3	And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Now it happened after this 
2CH.24.5	Then he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and 
2CH.24.5	However the Levites did not do it quickly. 
2CH.24.6	So the king called Jehoiada the chief 
2CH.24.7	For 
2CH.24.8	Then at the king’s command 
2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the 
2CH.24.10	Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought their contributions, and put 
2CH.24.11	So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king’s official by the hand of the Levites, and 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them; they restored the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it. 
2CH.24.14	When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; 
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	Therefore they left the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet He 
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God came upon 
2CH.24.21	So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they 
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, “The 
2CH.24.23	So it happened in the spring of the year 
2CH.24.24	For the army of the Syrians 
2CH.24.25	And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), 
2CH.24.26	These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Now 
2CH.25.1	Amaziah 
2CH.25.2	And he did 
2CH.25.3	Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	However he did not execute their children, but 
2CH.25.5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, according to 
2CH.25.6	He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a 
2CH.25.8	But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! 
2CH.25.9	Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what 
2CH.25.9	And the man of God answered, 
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
2CH.25.11	Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to 
2CH.25.12	Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were dashed in pieces.
2CH.25.13	But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much spoil.
2CH.25.14	Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that 
2CH.25.15	Therefore the anger of the 
2CH.25.16	So it was, as he talked with him, that 
2CH.25.16	Then the prophet ceased, and said, “I know that God has 
2CH.25.17	Now 
2CH.25.18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that 
2CH.25.19	Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to 
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not heed, for 
2CH.25.21	So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at 
2CH.25.22	And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of 
2CH.25.24	And 
2CH.25.25	Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed 
2CH.25.27	After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the 
2CH.25.28	Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah.
2CH.26.1	Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who 
2CH.26.2	He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.
2CH.26.3	Uzziah 
2CH.26.4	And he did 
2CH.26.5	He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who 
2CH.26.6	Now he went out and 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against 
2CH.26.8	Also the Ammonites 
2CH.26.9	And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the 
2CH.26.10	Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; 
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies, according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, 
2CH.26.12	The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor 
2CH.26.13	And under their authority 
2CH.26.14	Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings 
2CH.26.15	And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by 
2CH.26.16	But 
2CH.26.17	So 
2CH.26.18	And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah became furious; and he 
2CH.26.20	And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there, on his forehead, he 
2CH.26.21	King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, 
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which 
2CH.27.1	Jotham 
2CH.27.2	And he did 
2CH.27.3	He built the Upper Gate of the house of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. 
2CH.27.5	He also fought with the king of the 
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty, 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed they 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then 
2CH.28.1	Ahaz 
2CH.28.2	For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made 
2CH.28.3	He burned incense in 
2CH.28.4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Therefore 
2CH.28.6	For 
2CH.28.7	Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah 
2CH.28.8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their 
2CH.28.9	But a 
2CH.28.10	And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, 
2CH.28.12	Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, 
2CH.28.13	and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for we 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	Then the men 
2CH.28.16	At the same time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. 
2CH.28.17	For again the 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there. 
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	Also 
2CH.28.21	For Ahaz took part 
2CH.28.22	Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the 
2CH.28.23	For 
2CH.28.24	So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God, cut in pieces the articles of the house of God, 
2CH.28.25	And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, indeed they 
2CH.28.27	So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they 
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah 
2CH.29.2	And he did 
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he 
2CH.29.4	Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square, 
2CH.29.5	and said to them: “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.7	They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy 
2CH.29.8	Therefore the 
2CH.29.9	For indeed, because of this 
2CH.29.10	“Now 
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not be negligent now, for the 
2CH.29.12	Then these Levites arose: 
2CH.29.13	of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
2CH.29.14	of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren, 
2CH.29.16	Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began to sanctify on the first 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the 
2CH.29.19	Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had 
2CH.29.20	Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and 
2CH.29.23	Then they brought out the male goats 
2CH.29.24	And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering 
2CH.29.25	And he stationed the Levites in the house of the 
2CH.29.26	The Levites stood with the instruments 
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah commanded 
2CH.29.28	So all the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all 
2CH.29.29	And when they had finished offering, 
2CH.29.30	Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now 
2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, 
2CH.29.33	The consecrated things 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings; therefore 
2CH.29.35	Also the burnt offerings 
2CH.29.35	So the service of the house of the 
2CH.29.36	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the events took place so suddenly.
2CH.30.1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the 
2CH.30.2	For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to keep the Passover in the second 
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it 
2CH.30.4	And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly. 
2CH.30.5	So they resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the 
2CH.30.6	Then the 
2CH.30.7	And do not be 
2CH.30.8	Now do not be 
2CH.30.9	For if you return to the 
2CH.30.10	So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless 
2CH.30.12	Also 
2CH.30.13	Now many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of 
2CH.30.14	They arose and took away the 
2CH.30.15	Then they slaughtered the Passover 
2CH.30.16	They stood in their 
2CH.30.17	For 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept 
2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites 
2CH.30.23	Then the whole assembly agreed to keep 
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah 
2CH.30.25	The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, also the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests, the Levites, arose and 
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and 
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed 
2CH.31.3	The king also 
2CH.31.4	Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance 
2CH.31.6	And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	And Azariah the chief priest, from the 
2CH.31.11	Now Hezekiah commanded 
2CH.31.12	Then they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things; 
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah 
2CH.31.14	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, 
2CH.31.15	And under him 
2CH.31.16	Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the 
2CH.31.17	and to the priests who were written in the genealogy according to their father’s house, and to the Levites 
2CH.31.18	and to all who were written in the genealogy—their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them—for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.
2CH.31.19	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, 
2CH.31.20	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did 
2CH.32.1	After 
2CH.32.2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he consulted with his leaders and commanders to stop the water from the springs which 
2CH.32.4	Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the 
2CH.32.5	And 
2CH.32.6	Then he set military captains over the people, gathered them together to him in the open square of the city gate, and 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous; 
2CH.32.8	With him 
2CH.32.9	After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him 
2CH.32.10	“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: ‘In what do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, 
2CH.32.12	Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, “You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on 
2CH.32.13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of 
2CH.32.14	Who 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore, 
2CH.32.16	Furthermore, his servants spoke against the 
2CH.32.17	He also wrote letters to revile the 
2CH.32.18	Then they called out with a loud voice in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who 
2CH.32.19	And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth—
2CH.32.20	Now because of this King Hezekiah and 
2CH.32.21	Then the 
2CH.32.22	Thus the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts to the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah 
2CH.32.26	Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable items; 
2CH.32.28	storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks. 
2CH.32.29	Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for 
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah 
2CH.32.31	However, 
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, indeed they 
2CH.32.33	So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
2CH.33.1	Manasseh 
2CH.33.2	But he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.3	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had 
2CH.33.4	He also built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven 
2CH.33.6	Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; he practiced 
2CH.33.7	He even set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, 
2CH.33.8	and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers—only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.” 
2CH.33.9	So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the 
2CH.33.10	And the 
2CH.33.11	Therefore the 
2CH.33.12	Now when he was in affliction, he implored the 
2CH.33.13	and prayed to Him; and He 
2CH.33.14	After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of 
2CH.33.15	He took away 
2CH.33.16	He also repaired the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of 
2CH.33.19	Also his prayer and 
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon 
2CH.33.22	But he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.23	And he did not humble himself before the 
2CH.33.24	Then his servants conspired against him, and 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah 
2CH.34.2	And he did 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still 
2CH.34.4	They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars which 
2CH.34.5	He also 
2CH.34.6	And 
2CH.34.7	When he had broken down the altars and the wooden images, had 
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the temple, he sent 
2CH.34.9	When they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered 
2CH.34.10	Then they put 
2CH.34.11	They gave 
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully. Their overseers 
2CH.34.14	Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the 
2CH.34.16	So Shaphan carried the book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, “All that was committed to your servants they are doing. 
2CH.34.17	And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.
2CH.34.19	Thus it happened, when the king heard the words of the Law, that he tore his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	Then the king commanded Hilkiah, 
2CH.34.21	“Go, inquire of the 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and those the king 
2CH.34.23	Then she answered them, “Thus says the 
2CH.34.24	“Thus says the 
2CH.34.25	because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place, and not be quenched.’ ” ’ 
2CH.34.26	But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2CH.34.27	because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard 
2CH.34.28	“Surely I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	The king went up to the house of the 
2CH.34.31	Then the king 
2CH.34.32	And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
2CH.34.33	Thus Josiah removed all the 
2CH.35.1	Now 
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests in their 
2CH.35.3	Then he said to the Levites 
2CH.35.4	Prepare 
2CH.35.5	And 
2CH.35.6	So slaughter the Passover 
2CH.35.7	Then Josiah 
2CH.35.8	And his 
2CH.35.9	Also 
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests 
2CH.35.11	And they slaughtered the Passover 
2CH.35.12	Then they removed the burnt offerings that 
2CH.35.13	Also they 
2CH.35.14	Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, 
2CH.35.15	And the singers, the sons of Asaph, 
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of 
2CH.35.18	There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against 
2CH.35.21	But he sent messengers to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? 
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but 
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am severely wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in 
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah also 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to 
2CH.35.27	and his deeds from first to last, indeed they 
2CH.36.1	Then 
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz 
2CH.36.3	Now the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	Then the king of Egypt made 
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim 
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried off 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, indeed they 
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin 
2CH.36.10	At the turn of the year 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah 
2CH.36.12	He did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	And he also 
2CH.36.14	Moreover all the leaders of the priests and the people transgressed more and more, 
2CH.36.15	And the 
2CH.36.16	But 
2CH.36.17	Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who 
2CH.36.18	And all the articles from the house of God, great and small, the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.36.19	Then they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions. 
2CH.36.20	And 
2CH.36.21	to fulfill the word of the 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
2CH.36.23	Thus says Cyrus king of Persia:
2CH.36.23	All the kingdoms of the earth the

EZR.4.5	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of 
EZR.4.6	In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	In the days of 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes in this fashion:
EZR.4.9	From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions—
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapper took captive and settled in the cities of Samaria and the remainder beyond the River —
EZR.4.11	(This 
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men 
EZR.4.12	Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem, and are building the 
EZR.4.13	Let it now be known to the king that, if this city is built and the walls completed, they will not pay 
EZR.4.14	Now because we receive support from the palace, it was not proper for us to see the king’s dishonor; therefore we have sent and informed the king,
EZR.4.15	that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. And you will find in the book of the records and know that this city 
EZR.4.16	We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the result will be that you will have no dominion beyond the River.
EZR.4.17	The king sent an answer:
EZR.4.17	To Rehum the commander, 
EZR.4.17	Peace, and so forth.
EZR.4.18	The letter which you sent to us has been clearly read before me. 
EZR.4.19	And I gave the command, and a search has been made, and it was found that this city in former times has revolted against kings, and rebellion and sedition have been fostered in it.
EZR.4.20	There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have 
EZR.4.21	Now give the command to make these men cease, that this city may not be built until the command is given by me.
EZR.4.22	Take heed now that you do not fail to do this. Why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?
EZR.4.23	Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter 
EZR.4.24	Thus the work of the house of God which 
EZR.5.1	Then the prophet

EZR.5.3	At the same time 
EZR.5.4	Then, accordingly, we told them the names of the men who were constructing this building. 
EZR.5.5	But 
EZR.5.6	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent:
EZR.5.6	The governor of 
EZR.5.7	(They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus)
EZR.5.7	To Darius the king:
EZR.5.7	All peace.
EZR.5.8	Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the temple of the great God, which is being built with heavy stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.
EZR.5.9	Then we asked those elders, 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who 
EZR.5.11	And thus they returned us an answer, saying: “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built 
EZR.5.12	But 
EZR.5.13	However, in the first year of

EZR.6.6	Now 
EZR.6.7	Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.
EZR.6.8	Moreover I issue a decree 
EZR.6.9	And whatever they need—young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who 
EZR.6.10	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
EZR.6.11	Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; 
EZR.6.12	And may the God who causes His 
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai, governor of 
EZR.6.14	So the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished 
EZR.6.15	Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 
EZR.6.16	Then the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the descendants of the captivity, celebrated 
EZR.6.17	And they 
EZR.6.18	They assigned the priests to their 
EZR.6.19	And the descendants of the captivity kept the Passover 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites had 
EZR.6.21	Then the children of Israel who had returned from the captivity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the

EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest— 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra came up from Babylon; and he 
EZR.7.7	 of the children of Israel, the priests, 
EZR.7.8	And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which 
EZR.7.9	On the first 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to 
EZR.7.11	This 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, 
EZR.7.12	To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the Law of the God of heaven:
EZR.7.12	Perfect 
EZR.7.13	I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm, who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you.
EZR.7.14	And whereas you are being sent by the king and his 
EZR.7.15	and 
EZR.7.16	and 
EZR.7.17	now therefore, be careful to buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, with their 
EZR.7.18	And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do it according to the will of your God.
EZR.7.19	Also the articles that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.
EZR.7.20	And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, pay 
EZR.7.21	And I, 
EZR.7.22	up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred kors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribed limit.
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it diligently be done for the house of the God of heaven. For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
EZR.7.24	Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax, tribute, or custom on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God.
EZR.7.25	And you, Ezra, according to your God-given wisdom, 
EZR.7.26	Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily on him, whether 
EZR.7.27	Blessed 
EZR.7.28	and 
EZR.7.28	So I was encouraged, as 
EZR.8.1	These 
EZR.8.2	of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, 
EZR.8.3	of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of 
EZR.8.4	of the sons of 
EZR.8.5	of the sons of Shechaniah, Ben-Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males; 
EZR.8.6	of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males; 
EZR.8.7	of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;

EZR.8.13	of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names 
EZR.8.14	also of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
EZR.8.15	Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And I looked among the people and the priests, and found none of the 
EZR.8.16	Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and 
EZR.8.17	And I gave them a command for Iddo the chief man at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo 
EZR.8.18	Then, by the good hand of our God upon us, they 
EZR.8.19	and 
EZR.8.20	also of the Nethinim, whom David and the leaders had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim. All of them were designated by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I 
EZR.8.22	For 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and entreated our God for this, and He 
EZR.8.24	And I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them— 
EZR.8.25	and weighed out to them 
EZR.8.26	I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, silver articles 
EZR.8.27	twenty gold basins 
EZR.8.28	And I said to them, “You 
EZR.8.29	Watch and keep 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites received the silver and the gold and the articles by weight, to bring 
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth 
EZR.8.32	So we 
EZR.8.33	Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles were 
EZR.8.34	with the number 
EZR.8.35	The children of those who had been

EZR.9.3	So when I heard this thing, 
EZR.9.4	Then everyone who 
EZR.9.5	At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting; and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and 
EZR.9.6	And I said: “O my God, I am too 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers to this day 
EZR.9.8	And now for a little while grace has been 
EZR.9.9	For we 
EZR.9.10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the

EZR.10.4	Arise, for 
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra arose, and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and 
EZR.10.7	And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the descendants of the captivity, that they must gather at Jerusalem, 
EZR.10.8	and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the instructions of the leaders and elders, all his property would be confiscated, and he himself would be separated from the assembly of those from the captivity.
EZR.10.9	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have transgressed and have taken pagan wives, adding to the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now therefore, 
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “Yes! As you have said, so we must do. 
EZR.10.13	But 
EZR.10.14	Please, let the leaders of our entire assembly stand; and let all those in our cities who have taken pagan wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of their cities, until 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and

NEH.1.5	And I said: “I pray, 
NEH.1.6	please let Your ear be attentive and 
NEH.1.7	We have acted very corruptly against You, and have 
NEH.1.8	Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, 
NEH.1.9	but 
NEH.1.10	Now these 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, I pray, please 
NEH.1.11	For I was the king’s 
NEH.2.1	And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of 
NEH.2.2	Therefore the king said to me, “Why 
NEH.2.2	So I became dreadfully afraid, 
NEH.2.3	and said to the king, 
NEH.2.4	Then the king said to me, “What do you request?”
NEH.2.4	So I 
NEH.2.5	And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”
NEH.2.6	Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him 
NEH.2.7	Furthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the

NEH.2.10	When 
NEH.2.11	So I 
NEH.2.12	Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode. 
NEH.2.13	And I went out by night 
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the 
NEH.2.15	So I went up in the night by the 
NEH.2.16	And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we

NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard 
NEH.2.20	So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, 
NEH.3.1	Then 
NEH.3.2	Next to 
NEH.3.3	Also the sons of Hassenaah built

NEH.3.32	And between the upper room at the corner, as far as the 
NEH.4.1	But it so happened, 
NEH.4.2	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish—
NEH.4.3	Now 
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God, for we are despised; 
NEH.4.5	Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked 
NEH.4.6	So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its 
NEH.4.7	Now it happened, 
NEH.4.8	and all of them 
NEH.4.9	Nevertheless 
NEH.4.10	Then Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and 
NEH.4.11	And our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.”
NEH.4.12	So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, “From whatever place you turn, 
NEH.4.13	Therefore I positioned 
NEH.4.14	And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, 
NEH.4.15	And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and 
NEH.4.16	So it was, from that time on, 
NEH.4.17	Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon. 
NEH.4.18	Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet 
NEH.4.19	Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “The work 
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. 
NEH.4.21	So we labored in the work, and half of 
NEH.4.22	At the same time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.” 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, 
NEH.5.1	And there was a great 
NEH.5.2	For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters 
NEH.5.3	There were also 
NEH.5.4	There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax 
NEH.5.5	Yet now 
NEH.5.6	And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, 
NEH.5.8	And I said to them, “According to our ability we have 
NEH.5.8	Then they were silenced and found nothing 
NEH.5.9	Then I said, “What you are doing 
NEH.5.10	I also, 
NEH.5.11	Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.”
NEH.5.12	So they said, “We will restore 
NEH.5.12	Then I called the priests, 
NEH.5.13	Then 
NEH.5.13	And all the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors who 
NEH.5.16	Indeed, I also continued the 
NEH.5.17	And 
NEH.5.18	Now 
NEH.5.19	Remember me, my God, for good, 
NEH.6.1	Now it happened 
NEH.6.2	that Sanballat and Geshem 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I 
NEH.6.4	But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	In it 
NEH.6.6	It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, 
NEH.6.7	And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, “
NEH.6.8	Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.”
NEH.6.9	For they all 
NEH.6.9	Now therefore, 
NEH.6.10	Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who 
NEH.6.11	And I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who 
NEH.6.12	Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that 
NEH.6.13	For this reason he 
NEH.6.14	My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth 
NEH.6.16	And it happened, 
NEH.6.17	Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the 
NEH.6.19	Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
NEH.7.1	Then it was, when the wall was built and I had 
NEH.7.2	that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother 
NEH.7.3	And I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand 
NEH.7.4	Now the city 
NEH.7.5	Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first

NEH.7.65	And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim.
NEH.7.66	Altogether the whole assembly 
NEH.7.67	besides their male and female servants, of whom 
NEH.7.68	Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five, 
NEH.7.69	 camels four hundred and thirty-five, 
NEH.7.70	And some of the heads of the fathers’ 
NEH.7.71	Some of the heads of the fathers’ 
NEH.7.72	And that which the rest of the people gave 
NEH.7.73	So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, 
NEH.7.73	When the seventh month came, the children of Israel 
NEH.8.1	Now all 
NEH.8.2	So Ezra the priest brought 
NEH.8.3	Then he 
NEH.8.4	So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, 
NEH.8.5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was 
NEH.8.6	And Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.6	Then all the people 
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, 
NEH.8.8	So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped 
NEH.8.9	And Nehemiah, who 
NEH.8.10	Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day 
NEH.8.12	And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to 
NEH.8.13	Now on the second day the heads of the fathers’ 
NEH.8.14	And they found written in the Law, which the 
NEH.8.15	and 
NEH.8.16	Then the people went out and brought 
NEH.8.17	So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very 
NEH.8.18	Also 
NEH.9.1	Now on the twenty-fourth day of 
NEH.9.2	Then 
NEH.9.3	And they stood up in their place and 
NEH.9.4	Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, 
NEH.9.5	And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.9.5	“Stand up 
NEH.9.5	Forever and ever!
NEH.9.5	“Blessed be 
NEH.9.5	Which is exalted above all blessing and praise!
NEH.9.6	You alone 
NEH.9.6	You have made heaven,
NEH.9.6	The heaven of heavens, with 
NEH.9.6	The earth and everything on it,
NEH.9.6	The seas and all that is in them,
NEH.9.6	And You 
NEH.9.6	The host of heaven worships You.
NEH.9.7	“You 
NEH.9.7	Who chose 
NEH.9.7	And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans,
NEH.9.7	And gave him the name 
NEH.9.8	You found his heart 
NEH.9.8	And made a 
NEH.9.8	To give the land of the Canaanites,
NEH.9.8	The Hittites, the Amorites,
NEH.9.8	The Perizzites, the Jebusites,
NEH.9.8	And the Girgashites—
NEH.9.8	To give 
NEH.9.8	You 
NEH.9.8	For You 
NEH.9.9	“You
NEH.9.9	And 
NEH.9.10	You 
NEH.9.10	Against all his servants,
NEH.9.10	And against all the people of his land.
NEH.9.10	For You knew that they 
NEH.9.10	So You 
NEH.9.11	And You divided the sea before them,
NEH.9.11	So that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land;
NEH.9.11	And their persecutors You threw into the deep,
NEH.9.11	As a stone into the mighty waters.
NEH.9.12	Moreover You 
NEH.9.12	And by night with a pillar of fire,
NEH.9.12	To give them light on the road
NEH.9.12	Which they should travel.
NEH.9.13	“You
NEH.9.13	And spoke with them from heaven,
NEH.9.13	And gave them 
NEH.9.13	Good statutes and commandments.
NEH.9.14	You made known to them Your 
NEH.9.14	And commanded them precepts, statutes and laws,
NEH.9.14	By the hand of Moses Your servant.
NEH.9.15	You 
NEH.9.15	And 
NEH.9.15	And told them to 
NEH.9.15	Which You had sworn to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But
NEH.9.16	Hardened their necks,
NEH.9.16	And did not heed Your commandments.
NEH.9.17	They refused to obey,
NEH.9.17	And 
NEH.9.17	That You did among them.
NEH.9.17	But they hardened their necks,
NEH.9.17	And in their rebellion
NEH.9.17	They appointed 
NEH.9.17	To return to their bondage.
NEH.9.17	But You 
NEH.9.17	Ready to pardon,
NEH.9.17	Gracious and merciful,
NEH.9.17	Slow to anger,
NEH.9.17	Abundant in kindness,
NEH.9.17	And did not forsake them.
NEH.9.18	“Even 
NEH.9.18	And said, ‘This 
NEH.9.18	That brought you up out of Egypt,’
NEH.9.18	And worked great provocations,
NEH.9.19	Yet in Your 
NEH.9.19	You did not forsake them in the wilderness.
NEH.9.19	The 
NEH.9.19	To lead them on the road;
NEH.9.19	Nor the pillar of fire by night,
NEH.9.19	To show them light,
NEH.9.19	And the way they should go.
NEH.9.20	You also gave Your 
NEH.9.20	And did not withhold Your 
NEH.9.20	And gave them 
NEH.9.21	Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness;
NEH.9.21	They lacked nothing;
NEH.9.21	Their 
NEH.9.21	And their feet did not swell.
NEH.9.22	“Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations,
NEH.9.22	And divided them into districts.
NEH.9.22	So they took possession of the land of 
NEH.9.22	The land of the king of Heshbon,
NEH.9.22	And the land of Og king of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	You also multiplied 
NEH.9.23	And brought them into the land
NEH.9.23	Which You had told their fathers
NEH.9.23	To go in and possess.
NEH.9.24	So 
NEH.9.24	And possessed the land;
NEH.9.24	You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land,
NEH.9.24	The Canaanites,
NEH.9.24	And gave them into their hands,
NEH.9.24	With their kings
NEH.9.24	And the people of the land,
NEH.9.24	That they might do with them as they wished.
NEH.9.25	And they took strong cities and a 
NEH.9.25	And possessed 
NEH.9.25	Cisterns 
NEH.9.25	And fruit trees in abundance.
NEH.9.25	So they ate and were filled and 
NEH.9.25	And delighted themselves in Your great 
NEH.9.26	“Nevertheless they 
NEH.9.26	And rebelled against You,
NEH.9.26	Cast Your law behind their backs
NEH.9.26	And killed Your 
NEH.9.26	To turn them to Yourself;
NEH.9.26	And they worked great provocations.
NEH.9.27	Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies,
NEH.9.27	Who oppressed them;
NEH.9.27	And in the time of their trouble,
NEH.9.27	When they cried to You,
NEH.9.27	You 
NEH.9.27	And according to Your abundant mercies
NEH.9.27	You gave them deliverers who saved them
NEH.9.27	From the hand of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	“But after they had rest,
NEH.9.28	They again did evil before You.
NEH.9.28	Therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies,
NEH.9.28	So that they had dominion over them;
NEH.9.28	Yet when they returned and cried out to You,
NEH.9.28	You heard from heaven;
NEH.9.28	And 
NEH.9.29	And testified against them,
NEH.9.29	That You might bring them back to Your law.
NEH.9.29	Yet they acted proudly,
NEH.9.29	And did not heed Your commandments,
NEH.9.29	But sinned against Your judgments,
NEH.9.29	‘Which if a man does, he shall live by them.’
NEH.9.29	And they shrugged their shoulders,
NEH.9.29	Stiffened their necks,
NEH.9.29	And would not hear.
NEH.9.30	Yet for many years You had patience with them,
NEH.9.30	And testified 
NEH.9.30	Yet they would not listen;
NEH.9.30	Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless in Your great mercy
NEH.9.31	You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them;
NEH.9.31	For You 
NEH.9.32	“Now therefore, our God,
NEH.9.32	The great, the 
NEH.9.32	Who keeps covenant and mercy:
NEH.9.32	Do not let all the trouble seem small before You
NEH.9.32	That has come upon us,
NEH.9.32	Our kings and our princes,
NEH.9.32	Our priests and our prophets,
NEH.9.32	Our fathers and on all Your people,
NEH.9.32	From the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.
NEH.9.33	However 
NEH.9.33	For You have dealt faithfully,
NEH.9.33	But 
NEH.9.34	Neither our kings nor our princes,
NEH.9.34	Our priests nor our fathers,
NEH.9.34	Have kept Your law,
NEH.9.34	Nor heeded Your commandments and Your testimonies,
NEH.9.34	With which You testified against them.
NEH.9.35	For they have 
NEH.9.35	Or in the many good 
NEH.9.35	Or in the large and rich land which You set before them;
NEH.9.35	Nor did they turn from their wicked works.
NEH.9.36	“Here 
NEH.9.36	And the land that You gave to our fathers,
NEH.9.36	To eat its fruit and its bounty,
NEH.9.36	Here we 
NEH.9.37	And 
NEH.9.37	You have set over us,
NEH.9.37	Because of our sins;
NEH.9.37	Also they have 
NEH.9.37	At their pleasure;
NEH.9.37	And we 
NEH.9.38	“And because of all this,

NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; 
NEH.12.22	During the reign of Darius the Persian, a record 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers’ 
NEH.12.24	And the heads of the Levites 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub 
NEH.12.26	These 
NEH.12.27	Now at 
NEH.12.28	And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the 
NEH.12.29	from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	Then the priests and Levites 
NEH.12.31	So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs. 
NEH.12.32	After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and some of the priests’ sons 
NEH.12.36	and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, 
NEH.12.37	By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up 
NEH.12.38	The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite 
NEH.12.39	and above the Gate of Ephraim, above 
NEH.12.40	So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and the half of the rulers with me; 
NEH.12.41	and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, 
NEH.12.42	also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director.
NEH.12.43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard 
NEH.12.44	And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the 
NEH.12.45	Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David 
NEH.12.47	In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for 
NEH.13.1	On that day 
NEH.13.2	because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but 
NEH.13.3	So it was, when they had heard the Law, 
NEH.13.4	Now before this, 
NEH.13.5	And he had prepared for him a large room, 
NEH.13.6	But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, 
NEH.13.7	and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in 
NEH.13.8	And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded them to 
NEH.13.10	I also realized that the portions for the Levites had 
NEH.13.11	So 
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse. 
NEH.13.13	And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them 
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw 
NEH.13.16	Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold 
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing 
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it 
NEH.13.20	Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
NEH.13.21	Then I warned them, and said to them, “Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do 
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites that 
NEH.13.22	Remember me, O my God, 
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw Jews 
NEH.13.24	And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people.
NEH.13.25	So I 
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, 
NEH.13.27	Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, 
NEH.13.28	And 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and 
NEH.13.30	Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also 
NEH.13.31	and 
NEH.13.31	Remember me, O my God, for good!
EST.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days of 
EST.1.2	in those days when King Ahasuerus 
EST.1.3	 in the third year of his reign he 
EST.1.4	when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days 
EST.1.5	And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel, from great to small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. 
EST.1.7	And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from the other, with royal wine in abundance, 
EST.1.8	In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according to each man’s pleasure.
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women 
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, 
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king, 
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command 
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the 
EST.1.14	those closest to him 
EST.1.15	“What 
EST.1.16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: “Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes, and all the people who 
EST.1.17	For the queen’s behavior will become known to all women, so that they will 
EST.1.18	This very day the 
EST.1.19	If it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it will 
EST.1.20	When the king’s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will 
EST.1.21	And the reply pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan. 
EST.1.22	Then he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, 
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s servants who attended him said: “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king; 
EST.2.3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women’s quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given 
EST.2.4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.”
EST.2.4	This thing pleased the king, and he did so.
EST.2.5	In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name 
EST.2.6	 had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. 
EST.2.7	And 
EST.2.8	So it was, when the king’s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were 
EST.2.9	Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily gave 
EST.2.10	Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal 
EST.2.11	And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women’s quarters, to learn of Esther’s welfare and what was happening to her.
EST.2.12	Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months’ preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women. 
EST.2.13	Thus 
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.
EST.2.15	Now when the turn came for Esther 
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which 
EST.2.17	The king loved Esther more than all the 
EST.2.18	Then the king 
EST.2.19	When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within the king’s gate. 
EST.2.20	 Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him.
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. 
EST.2.22	So the matter became known to Mordecai, 
EST.2.23	And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in 
EST.3.1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the 
EST.3.2	And all the king’s servants who 
EST.3.3	Then the king’s servants who 
EST.3.4	Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told 
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai 
EST.3.6	But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman 
EST.3.7	In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, 
EST.3.8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; 
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let 
EST.3.10	So the king 
EST.3.11	And the king said to Haman, “The money and the people 
EST.3.12	Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and 
EST.3.13	And the letters were 
EST.3.14	A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went out, hastened by the king’s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but 
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he 
EST.4.2	He went as far as the front of the king’s gate, for no one 
EST.4.3	And in every province where the king’s command and decree arrived, 
EST.4.4	So Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept 
EST.4.5	Then Esther called Hathach, 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that 
EST.4.7	And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and 
EST.4.8	He also gave him 
EST.4.9	So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
EST.4.10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a command for Mordecai: 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into 
EST.4.12	So they told Mordecai Esther’s words.
EST.4.13	And Mordecai told 
EST.4.14	For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for 
EST.4.15	Then Esther told 
EST.4.16	“Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now it happened 
EST.5.2	So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, 
EST.5.3	And the king said to her, “What do you wish, Queen Esther? What 
EST.5.4	So Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
EST.5.5	Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	At the banquet of wine 
EST.5.7	Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and request 
EST.5.8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the 
EST.5.9	So Haman went out that day 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman 
EST.5.11	Then Haman told them of his great riches, 
EST.5.12	Moreover Haman said, “Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
EST.5.14	Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a

EST.6.1	That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring 
EST.6.2	And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. 
EST.6.3	Then the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?”
EST.6.3	And the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”
EST.6.4	So the king said, “Who 
EST.6.5	The king’s servants said to him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.”
EST.6.5	And the king said, “Let him come in.”
EST.6.6	So Haman came in, and the king asked him, “What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?”
EST.6.6	Now Haman thought in his heart, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than 
EST.6.7	And Haman answered the king, “
EST.6.8	let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and 
EST.6.9	Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then parade him on horseback through the city square, 
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king’s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.”
EST.6.11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!”
EST.6.12	Afterward Mordecai went back to the king’s gate. But Haman 
EST.6.13	When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against 
EST.6.14	While they 
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. 
EST.7.2	And on the second day, 
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther answered and said, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. 
EST.7.4	For we have been 
EST.7.5	So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?”
EST.7.6	And Esther said, “The adversary and 
EST.7.6	So Haman was terrified before the king and queen.
EST.7.7	Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine 
EST.7.8	When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across 
EST.7.8	As the word left the king’s mouth, they 
EST.7.9	Now 
EST.7.9	Then the king said, “Hang him on it!”
EST.7.10	So 
EST.8.1	On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the 
EST.8.2	So the king took off 
EST.8.3	Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	And 
EST.8.5	and said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see 
EST.8.7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “Indeed, 
EST.8.8	You yourselves write 
EST.8.9	So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which 
EST.8.10	And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed 
EST.8.11	By these letters the king permitted the Jews who 
EST.8.12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth 
EST.8.13	A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
EST.8.14	The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel.
EST.8.15	So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and 
EST.8.16	The Jews had 
EST.8.17	And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast 
EST.9.1	Now 
EST.9.2	The Jews 
EST.9.3	And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king’s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. 
EST.9.4	For Mordecai 
EST.9.5	Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them.
EST.9.6	And in 
EST.9.7	Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha— 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews—they killed; 
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel was brought to the king. 
EST.9.12	And the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now 
EST.9.13	Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who 
EST.9.14	So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
EST.9.15	And the Jews who 
EST.9.16	The remainder of the Jews in the king’s provinces 
EST.9.18	But the Jews who 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar 
EST.9.20	And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who 
EST.9.21	to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, 
EST.9.22	as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of 
EST.9.23	So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them, 
EST.9.24	because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, 
EST.9.25	but 
EST.9.26	So they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of 
EST.9.27	the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would

EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, 
EST.9.30	And 
EST.9.31	to confirm these days of Purim at their 
EST.9.32	So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	And King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and

EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew 
JOB.1.1	There was a man 
JOB.1.2	And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 
JOB.1.3	Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.
JOB.1.4	And his sons would go and feast 
JOB.1.5	So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning 
JOB.1.6	Now 
JOB.1.7	And the 
JOB.1.7	So Satan answered the 
JOB.1.8	Then the 
JOB.1.9	So Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? 
JOB.1.11	But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely 
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.12	So Satan went out from the presence of the 
JOB.1.13	Now there was a day 
JOB.1.14	and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, 
JOB.1.15	when the Sabeans raided 
JOB.1.16	While he 
JOB.1.17	While he 
JOB.1.18	While he 
JOB.1.19	and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose, 
JOB.1.21	And he said:
JOB.1.21	“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
JOB.1.21	And naked shall I return there.
JOB.1.21	The 
JOB.1.21	Blessed be the name of the 
JOB.1.22	In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.
JOB.2.1	Again 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.2	Satan answered the 
JOB.2.3	Then the 
JOB.2.4	So Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his 
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So Satan went out from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself 
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”
JOB.2.10	But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. 
JOB.2.11	Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the 
JOB.2.12	And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and 
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him on the ground 
JOB.3.1	After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his 
JOB.3.2	And Job spoke, and said:
JOB.3.3	“May
JOB.3.3	And the night 
JOB.3.3	‘A male child is conceived.’
JOB.3.4	May that day be darkness;
JOB.3.4	May God above not seek it,
JOB.3.4	Nor the light shine upon it.
JOB.3.5	May darkness and 
JOB.3.5	May a cloud settle on it;
JOB.3.5	May the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	May it not rejoice among the days of the year,
JOB.3.6	May it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Oh, may that night be barren!
JOB.3.7	May no joyful shout come into it!
JOB.3.8	May those curse it who curse the day,
JOB.3.8	Those 
JOB.3.9	May the stars of its morning be dark;
JOB.3.9	May it look for light, but 
JOB.3.9	And not see the dawning of the day;
JOB.3.10	Because it did not shut up the doors of my 
JOB.3.10	Nor hide sorrow from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why
JOB.3.11	 did I 
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me?
JOB.3.12	Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?
JOB.3.13	For now I would have lain still and been quiet,
JOB.3.13	I would have been asleep;
JOB.3.13	Then I would have been at rest
JOB.3.14	With kings and counselors of the earth,
JOB.3.14	Who 
JOB.3.15	Or with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	Who filled their houses 
JOB.3.16	Or 
JOB.3.16	Like infants who never saw light?
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease 
JOB.3.17	And there the weary are at 
JOB.3.18	 the prisoners rest together;
JOB.3.18	They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
JOB.3.19	The small and great are there,
JOB.3.19	And the servant 
JOB.3.20	“Why
JOB.3.20	And life to the 
JOB.3.21	Who 
JOB.3.21	And search for it more than 
JOB.3.22	Who rejoice exceedingly,
JOB.3.22	 are glad when they can find the 
JOB.3.23	And whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing comes before I eat,
JOB.3.24	And my groanings pour out like water.
JOB.3.25	For the thing I greatly 
JOB.3.25	And what I dreaded has happened to me.
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;
JOB.3.26	I have no rest, for trouble comes.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
JOB.4.2	“
JOB.4.2	But who can withhold himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Surely you have instructed many,
JOB.4.3	And you 
JOB.4.4	Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,
JOB.4.4	And you 
JOB.4.5	But now it comes upon you, and you are weary;
JOB.4.5	It touches you, and you are troubled.
JOB.4.6	 not 
JOB.4.6	And the integrity of your ways your hope?
JOB.4.7	“Remember now, 
JOB.4.7	Or where were the upright 
JOB.4.8	Even as I have seen,
JOB.4.8	Those who plow iniquity
JOB.4.8	And sow trouble reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the blast of God they perish,
JOB.4.9	And by the breath of His anger they are consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion,
JOB.4.10	The voice of the fierce lion,
JOB.4.10	And 
JOB.4.11	The old lion perishes for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	“Now a word was secretly brought to me,
JOB.4.12	And my ear received a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	When deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.4.14	Fear came upon me, and 
JOB.4.14	Which made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face;
JOB.4.15	The hair on my body stood up.
JOB.4.16	It stood still,
JOB.4.16	But I could not discern its appearance.
JOB.4.16	A form 
JOB.4.16	Then I heard a voice 
JOB.4.17	‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God?
JOB.4.17	Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
JOB.4.18	If He 
JOB.4.18	 He charges His angels with error,
JOB.4.19	How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
JOB.4.19	Whose foundation is in the dust,
JOB.4.19	 are crushed before a moth?
JOB.4.20	They are broken in pieces from morning till evening;
JOB.4.20	They perish forever, with no one regarding.
JOB.4.21	Does not their own excellence go away?
JOB.4.21	They die, even without wisdom.’
JOB.5.1	“Call out now;
JOB.5.1	Is there anyone who will answer you?
JOB.5.1	And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
JOB.5.2	For wrath kills a foolish man,
JOB.5.2	And envy slays a simple one.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root,
JOB.5.3	But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.
JOB.5.4	His sons are 
JOB.5.4	They are crushed in the gate,
JOB.5.4	And 
JOB.5.5	Because the hungry eat up his harvest,
JOB.5.5	Taking it even from the thorns,
JOB.5.5	And a snare snatches their substance.
JOB.5.6	For affliction does not come from the dust,
JOB.5.6	Nor does trouble spring from the ground;
JOB.5.7	Yet man is 
JOB.5.7	As the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“But as for me, I would seek God,
JOB.5.8	And to God I would commit my cause—
JOB.5.9	Who does great things, and unsearchable,
JOB.5.9	Marvelous things without number.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain on the earth,
JOB.5.10	And sends waters on the fields.
JOB.5.11	He sets on high those who are lowly,
JOB.5.11	And those who mourn are lifted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the devices of the crafty,
JOB.5.12	So that their hands cannot carry out their plans.
JOB.5.13	He catches the

JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime,
JOB.5.14	And grope at noontime as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But 
JOB.5.15	From the mouth of the mighty,
JOB.5.15	And from their hand.
JOB.5.16	So the poor have hope,
JOB.5.16	And injustice shuts her mouth.
JOB.5.17	“Behold,
JOB.5.17	Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For He bruises, but He binds up;
JOB.5.18	He wounds, but His hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He shall deliver you in six troubles,
JOB.5.19	Yes, in seven 
JOB.5.20	In famine He shall redeem you from death,
JOB.5.20	And in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
JOB.5.21	And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	You shall laugh at destruction and famine,
JOB.5.22	And 
JOB.5.23	For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You shall know that your tent 
JOB.5.24	You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.
JOB.5.25	You shall also know that 
JOB.5.25	And your offspring 
JOB.5.26	You shall come to the grave at a full age,
JOB.5.26	As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season.
JOB.5.27	Behold, this we have 
JOB.5.27	It 
JOB.5.27	Hear it, and know for yourself.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.6.2	“Oh, that my grief were fully weighed,
JOB.6.2	And my calamity laid with it on the scales!
JOB.6.3	For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea—
JOB.6.3	Therefore my words have been rash.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty 
JOB.6.4	My spirit drinks in their poison;

JOB.6.5	Does the 
JOB.6.5	Or does the ox low over its fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can flavorless food be eaten without salt?

JOB.6.7	My soul refuses to touch them;
JOB.6.7	They 
JOB.6.8	“Oh, that I might have my request,
JOB.6.8	That God would grant 
JOB.6.9	That it would please God to crush me,
JOB.6.9	That He would loose His hand and 
JOB.6.10	Then I would still have comfort;
JOB.6.10	Though in anguish I would exult,
JOB.6.10	He will not spare;

JOB.6.13	And is success driven from me?
JOB.6.14	“To

JOB.6.15	My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook,
JOB.6.15	Like the streams of the brooks that pass away,
JOB.6.16	Which are dark because of the ice,
JOB.6.16	 into which the snow vanishes.
JOB.6.17	When it is warm, they cease to flow;
JOB.6.17	When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
JOB.6.18	The paths of their way turn aside,

JOB.6.21	For now 
JOB.6.21	You see terror and 
JOB.6.22	Did I ever say, ‘Bring 
JOB.6.22	Or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’?
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s hand’?
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of oppressors’?
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will hold my tongue;
JOB.6.24	Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forceful are right words!
JOB.6.25	But what does your arguing prove?
JOB.6.26	Do you intend to rebuke 
JOB.6.26	And the speeches of a desperate one, 
JOB.6.27	Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless,
JOB.6.27	And you 
JOB.6.28	Now therefore, be pleased to look at me;
JOB.6.28	For I would never lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Yield now, let there be no injustice!
JOB.6.29	Yes, concede, my 
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice on my tongue?
JOB.6.30	Cannot my taste discern the unsavory?
JOB.7.1	“
JOB.7.2	Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade,
JOB.7.2	And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages,
JOB.7.3	So I have been allotted 
JOB.7.3	And wearisome nights have been appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise,
JOB.7.4	And the night be ended?’
JOB.7.4	For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is

JOB.7.13	When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,

JOB.7.14	Then You scare me with dreams
JOB.7.14	And terrify me with visions,
JOB.7.15	So that my soul chooses strangling
JOB.7.15	 death rather than my body.
JOB.7.16	I loathe

JOB.7.16	Let me alone,

JOB.7.19	And let me alone till I swallow my saliva?
JOB.7.20	Have I sinned?
JOB.7.20	What have I done to You, 
JOB.7.20	Why 
JOB.7.20	So that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	Why then do You not pardon my transgression,

JOB.8.2	“How long will you speak these 
JOB.8.2	And the words of your mouth 
JOB.8.3	Does God subvert judgment?
JOB.8.3	Or does the Almighty pervert justice?
JOB.8.4	If 
JOB.8.4	He has cast them away for their transgression.
JOB.8.5	If you would earnestly seek God
JOB.8.5	And make your supplication to the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	If you 
JOB.8.6	Surely now He would awake for you,
JOB.8.6	And prosper your rightful dwelling place.
JOB.8.7	Though your beginning was small,
JOB.8.7	Yet your latter end would 
JOB.8.8	“For
JOB.8.8	And consider the things discovered by their fathers;
JOB.8.9	For 
JOB.8.9	Because our days on earth 
JOB.8.10	Will they not teach you and tell you,
JOB.8.10	And utter words from their heart?
JOB.8.11	“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?
JOB.8.11	Can the reeds flourish without water?

JOB.8.14	And whose trust 
JOB.8.15	He leans on his house, but it does not stand.
JOB.8.15	He holds it fast, but it does not endure.
JOB.8.16	He grows green in the sun,
JOB.8.16	And his branches spread out in his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots wrap around the rock heap,
JOB.8.17	 look for a place in the stones.
JOB.8.18	If he is destroyed from his place,
JOB.8.18	Then 
JOB.8.19	“Behold, this is the joy of His way,
JOB.8.19	And 
JOB.8.20	Behold, 
JOB.8.20	Nor will He uphold the evildoers.
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughing,
JOB.8.21	And your lips with rejoicing.
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be 
JOB.8.22	And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.9.2	“Truly I know 
JOB.9.2	But how can a 
JOB.9.3	If one wished to contend with Him,
JOB.9.3	He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	Who has hardened 
JOB.9.5	He removes the mountains, and they do not know
JOB.9.5	When He overturns them in His anger;
JOB.9.6	He 
JOB.9.6	And its 
JOB.9.7	He commands the sun, and it does not rise;
JOB.9.7	He seals off the stars;
JOB.9.8	He alone spreads out the heavens,
JOB.9.8	And treads on the waves of the sea;
JOB.9.9	He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
JOB.9.9	And the chambers of the south;
JOB.9.10	He does great things past finding out,
JOB.9.10	Yes, wonders without number.
JOB.9.11	If He goes by me, I do not see 
JOB.9.11	If He moves past, I do not perceive Him;
JOB.9.12	If He takes away, who can hinder Him?
JOB.9.12	Who can say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’
JOB.9.13	God will not withdraw His anger,
JOB.9.13	The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.
JOB.9.14	“How then can I answer Him,
JOB.9.14	 choose my words 
JOB.9.15	For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him;
JOB.9.15	I would beg mercy of my Judge.
JOB.9.16	If I called and He answered me,
JOB.9.16	I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.
JOB.9.17	For He crushes me with a tempest,
JOB.9.17	And multiplies my wounds 
JOB.9.18	He will not allow me to catch my breath,
JOB.9.18	But fills me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If 
JOB.9.19	And if of justice, who will appoint my day 
JOB.9.20	Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me;
JOB.9.20	Though I 
JOB.9.21	“I am blameless, yet I do not know myself;
JOB.9.21	I despise my life.
JOB.9.22	It 
JOB.9.22	Therefore I say, 
JOB.9.23	If the scourge slays suddenly,
JOB.9.23	He laughs at the plight of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.
JOB.9.24	He covers the faces of its judges.
JOB.9.24	If it is not 
JOB.9.25	“Now 
JOB.9.25	They flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They pass by like swift ships,
JOB.9.26	Like an eagle swooping on its prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,’
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sufferings;
JOB.9.28	I know that You 
JOB.9.29	 I am condemned,
JOB.9.29	Why then do I labor in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow water,
JOB.9.30	And cleanse my hands with soap,
JOB.9.31	Yet You will plunge me into the pit,
JOB.9.31	And my own clothes will abhor me.
JOB.9.32	“For 
JOB.9.32	 I may answer Him,
JOB.9.33	Nor is there any mediator between us,
JOB.9.33	 may lay his hand on us both.
JOB.9.34	Let Him take His rod away from me,
JOB.9.34	And do not let dread of Him terrify me.
JOB.9.35	 I would speak and not fear Him,
JOB.9.35	But it is not so with me.
JOB.10.1	“My 
JOB.10.1	I will give free course to my complaint,
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;
JOB.10.2	Show me why You contend with me.
JOB.10.3	That You should despise the work of Your hands,
JOB.10.3	And smile on the counsel of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Do You have eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Or 
JOB.10.5	 Your days like the days of a mortal man?
JOB.10.5	 Your years like the days of a mighty man,
JOB.10.6	That You should seek for my iniquity
JOB.10.6	And search out my sin,
JOB.10.7	Although You know that I am not wicked,
JOB.10.7	And 
JOB.10.8	‘Your

JOB.10.8	Yet You would 
JOB.10.9	Remember, I pray, 
JOB.10.9	And will You turn me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Did You not pour me out like milk,
JOB.10.10	And curdle me like cheese,
JOB.10.11	Clothe me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	And knit me together with bones and sinews?
JOB.10.12	You have granted me life and favor,
JOB.10.12	And Your care has preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	‘And these 
JOB.10.13	I know that this 
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then

JOB.10.15	Even 
JOB.10.15	See my misery!
JOB.10.16	If 
JOB.10.16	You hunt me like a fierce lion,
JOB.10.16	And again You show Yourself awesome against me.
JOB.10.17	You renew Your witnesses against me,
JOB.10.17	And increase Your indignation toward me;
JOB.10.17	Changes and war are 
JOB.10.18	‘Why
JOB.10.18	Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!
JOB.10.19	I would have been as though I had not been.
JOB.10.19	I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Are not my days few?
JOB.10.20	Cease! 
JOB.10.21	Before I go 
JOB.10.21	To the land of darkness 
JOB.10.22	A land as dark as darkness 
JOB.10.22	As the shadow of death, without any order,
JOB.10.22	 even the light 
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
JOB.11.2	“Should not the multitude of words be answered?
JOB.11.2	And should a man full of talk be vindicated?
JOB.11.3	Should your empty talk make men hold their peace?
JOB.11.3	And when you mock, should no one rebuke you?
JOB.11.4	For you have said,
JOB.11.4	‘My doctrine 
JOB.11.4	And I am clean in your eyes.’
JOB.11.5	But oh, that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	And open His lips against you,
JOB.11.6	That He would show you the secrets of wisdom!
JOB.11.6	For 
JOB.11.6	Know therefore that 
JOB.11.6	 than your iniquity 
JOB.11.7	“Can
JOB.11.7	Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	Deeper than Sheol— what can you know?
JOB.11.9	Their measure 
JOB.11.9	And broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	“If
JOB.11.10	Then who can hinder Him?
JOB.11.11	For 
JOB.11.11	He sees wickedness also.
JOB.11.11	Will He not then consider 
JOB.11.12	For an 
JOB.11.12	When a wild donkey’s colt is born a man.
JOB.11.13	“If you would 
JOB.11.13	And 
JOB.11.14	If iniquity 
JOB.11.14	And 
JOB.11.15	Then surely you could lift up your face without spot;
JOB.11.15	Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear;
JOB.11.16	Because you would 
JOB.11.16	And remember 
JOB.11.17	And 
JOB.11.17	 you were dark, you would be like the morning.
JOB.11.18	And you would be secure, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	Yes, you would dig 
JOB.11.19	You would also lie down, and no one would make 
JOB.11.19	 many would court your favor.
JOB.11.20	But 
JOB.11.20	And they shall not escape,
JOB.11.20	And 
JOB.12.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.12.2	“No doubt you 
JOB.12.2	And wisdom will die with you!
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you;

JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers prosper,
JOB.12.6	And those who provoke God are secure—
JOB.12.6	In what God provides by His hand.
JOB.12.7	“But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you;
JOB.12.7	And the birds of the air, and they will tell you;
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;
JOB.12.8	And the fish of the sea will explain to you.
JOB.12.9	Who among all these does not know
JOB.12.9	That the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	In whose hand 
JOB.12.10	And the 
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear test words
JOB.12.11	And the mouth taste its food?
JOB.12.12	Wisdom 
JOB.12.12	And with length of days, understanding.
JOB.12.13	“With Him

JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away plundered,
JOB.12.17	And makes fools of the judges.
JOB.12.18	He loosens the bonds of kings,
JOB.12.18	And binds their waist with a belt.
JOB.12.19	He leads princes away plundered,
JOB.12.19	And overthrows the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He deprives the trusted ones of speech,
JOB.12.20	And takes away the discernment of the elders.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on princes,
JOB.12.21	And disarms the mighty.
JOB.12.22	He 
JOB.12.22	And brings the shadow of death to light.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great, and destroys them;
JOB.12.23	He enlarges nations, and guides them.
JOB.12.24	He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth,
JOB.12.24	And 
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light,
JOB.12.25	And He makes them 
JOB.13.1	“Behold, my eye has seen all 
JOB.13.1	My ear has heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What you know, I also know;
JOB.13.2	I 
JOB.13.3	But I would speak to the Almighty,
JOB.13.3	And I desire to reason with God.
JOB.13.4	But you forgers of lies,
JOB.13.4	You 
JOB.13.5	Oh, that you would be silent,
JOB.13.5	And 
JOB.13.6	Now hear my reasoning,
JOB.13.6	And heed the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you speak wickedly for God,
JOB.13.7	And talk deceitfully for Him?
JOB.13.8	Will you show partiality for Him?
JOB.13.8	Will you contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Will it be well when He searches you out?
JOB.13.9	Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man?
JOB.13.10	He will surely rebuke you
JOB.13.10	If you secretly show partiality.
JOB.13.11	Will not His excellence make you afraid,
JOB.13.11	And the dread of Him fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your platitudes 
JOB.13.12	Your defenses are defenses of clay.
JOB.13.13	“Hold your peace with me, and let me speak,
JOB.13.13	Then let come on me what 
JOB.13.14	Why 
JOB.13.14	And put my life in my hands?
JOB.13.15	Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him.
JOB.13.15	Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him.
JOB.13.16	He also 
JOB.13.16	For a 
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to my speech,
JOB.13.17	And to my declaration with your ears.
JOB.13.18	See now, I have prepared 
JOB.13.18	I know that I shall be 
JOB.13.19	Who 
JOB.13.19	If now I hold my tongue, I perish.

JOB.13.20	Then I will not hide myself from You:
JOB.13.21	Withdraw Your hand far from me,
JOB.13.21	And let not the dread of You make me afraid.
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will 
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak, then You respond to me.
JOB.13.23	How many 
JOB.13.23	Make me know my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why do You hide Your face,
JOB.13.24	And 
JOB.13.25	Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro?
JOB.13.25	And will You pursue dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	For You write bitter things against me,
JOB.13.26	And 
JOB.13.27	You put my feet in the stocks,
JOB.13.27	And watch closely all my paths.
JOB.13.27	You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
JOB.13.28	“
JOB.13.28	Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	“Man 
JOB.14.1	Is of few days and 
JOB.14.2	He comes forth like a flower and fades away;

JOB.14.3	And 
JOB.14.4	Who 
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	Since his days 
JOB.14.5	The number of his months 
JOB.14.5	You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass.
JOB.14.6	Look away from him that he may rest,
JOB.14.6	Till 
JOB.14.7	“For there is hope for a tree,
JOB.14.7	If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	And that its tender shoots will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though its root may grow old in the earth,
JOB.14.8	And its stump may die in the ground,
JOB.14.9	 at the scent of water it will bud
JOB.14.9	And bring forth branches like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dies and is laid away;
JOB.14.10	Indeed he breathes his last
JOB.14.10	And where 
JOB.14.11	 water disappears from the sea,
JOB.14.11	And a river becomes parched and dries up,
JOB.14.12	So man lies down and does not rise.
JOB.14.12	Till the heavens 
JOB.14.12	They will not awake
JOB.14.12	Nor be roused from their sleep.
JOB.14.13	“Oh, that You would hide me in the grave,
JOB.14.13	That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past,
JOB.14.13	That You would appoint me a set time, and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, shall he live 
JOB.14.14	All the days of my hard service 
JOB.14.14	Till my change comes.
JOB.14.15	You shall call, and I will answer You;
JOB.14.15	You shall desire the work of Your hands.
JOB.14.16	For now 
JOB.14.16	But do not watch over my sin.
JOB.14.17	My transgression 
JOB.14.17	And You cover my iniquity.
JOB.14.18	“But 
JOB.14.18	And 
JOB.14.19	 water wears away stones,
JOB.14.19	So You destroy the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	You prevail forever against him, and he passes on;
JOB.14.20	You change his countenance and send him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honor, and 
JOB.14.21	They are brought low, and he does not perceive 
JOB.14.22	But his flesh will be in pain over it,
JOB.14.22	And his soul will mourn over it.”
JOB.15.1	Then 
JOB.15.2	“Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge,
JOB.15.2	And fill himself with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
JOB.15.3	Or by speeches with which he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	Yes, you cast off fear,
JOB.15.4	And restrain prayer before God.
JOB.15.5	For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
JOB.15.5	And you choose the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;

JOB.15.16	Who drinks iniquity like water!
JOB.15.17	“I will tell you, hear me;
JOB.15.17	What I have seen I will declare,
JOB.15.18	What wise men have told,

JOB.15.19	To whom alone the land was given,
JOB.15.19	And 
JOB.15.20	The wicked man writhes with pain all 
JOB.15.20	And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor.
JOB.15.21	Dreadful sounds 
JOB.15.21	In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him.
JOB.15.22	He does not believe that he will

JOB.15.24	Trouble and anguish make him afraid;
JOB.15.24	They overpower him, like a king ready for battle.
JOB.15.25	For he stretches out his hand against God,
JOB.15.25	And acts defiantly against the Almighty,
JOB.15.26	Running stubbornly against Him
JOB.15.26	With his strong, embossed shield.
JOB.15.27	“Though
JOB.15.27	And made 
JOB.15.28	He dwells in desolate cities,
JOB.15.28	In houses which no one inhabits,
JOB.15.28	Which are destined to become ruins.
JOB.15.29	He will not be rich,
JOB.15.29	Nor will his wealth 
JOB.15.29	Nor will his possessions overspread the earth.
JOB.15.30	He will not depart from darkness;
JOB.15.30	The flame will dry out his branches,
JOB.15.30	And 
JOB.15.31	Let him not 
JOB.15.31	For futility will be his reward.
JOB.15.32	It will be accomplished 
JOB.15.32	And his branch will not be green.
JOB.15.33	He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine,
JOB.15.33	And cast off his blossom like an olive tree.
JOB.15.34	For the company of hypocrites 
JOB.15.34	And fire will consume the tents of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive trouble and bring forth futility;
JOB.15.35	Their womb prepares deceit.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many such things;
JOB.16.2	Miserable comforters 
JOB.16.3	Shall words of wind have an end?
JOB.16.3	Or what provokes you that you answer?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as you 
JOB.16.4	If your soul were in my soul’s place.
JOB.16.4	I could heap up words against you,
JOB.16.4	And 
JOB.16.5	 I would strengthen you with my mouth,
JOB.16.5	And the comfort of my lips would relieve 
JOB.16.6	“Though I speak, my grief is not relieved;
JOB.16.6	And 
JOB.16.7	But now He has 
JOB.16.7	You 
JOB.16.8	You have shriveled me up,
JOB.16.8	And it is a 
JOB.16.8	My leanness rises up against me
JOB.16.8	 bears witness to my face.
JOB.16.9	He tears 
JOB.16.9	He gnashes at me with His teeth;
JOB.16.9	My adversary sharpens His gaze on me.
JOB.16.10	They 
JOB.16.10	They 
JOB.16.10	They gather together against me.
JOB.16.11	God 
JOB.16.11	And turned me over to the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but He has 
JOB.16.12	He also has taken 
JOB.16.12	He has 
JOB.16.13	His archers surround me.
JOB.16.13	He pierces my heart and does not pity;
JOB.16.13	He pours out my gall on the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaks me with wound upon wound;
JOB.16.14	He runs at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	“I have sewn sackcloth over my skin,
JOB.16.15	And 
JOB.16.16	My face is flushed from weeping,
JOB.16.16	And on my eyelids 
JOB.16.17	Although no violence 
JOB.16.17	And my prayer 
JOB.16.18	“O earth, do not cover my blood,
JOB.16.18	And 
JOB.16.19	Surely even now 
JOB.16.19	And my evidence 
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me;
JOB.16.20	My eyes pour out 
JOB.16.21	Oh, that one might plead for a man with God,
JOB.16.21	As a man 
JOB.16.22	For when a few years are finished,
JOB.16.22	I shall 
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is broken,
JOB.17.1	My days are extinguished,
JOB.17.1	The grave 
JOB.17.2	 not mockers with me?
JOB.17.2	And does not my eye dwell on their 
JOB.17.3	“Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself.
JOB.17.3	Who 
JOB.17.4	For You have hidden their heart from 
JOB.17.4	Therefore You will not exalt 
JOB.17.5	He who speaks flattery to 
JOB.17.5	Even the eyes of his children will 
JOB.17.6	“But He has made me 
JOB.17.6	And I have become one in whose face men spit.
JOB.17.7	My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow,
JOB.17.7	And all my members 
JOB.17.8	Upright 
JOB.17.8	And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite.
JOB.17.9	Yet the righteous will hold to his 
JOB.17.9	And he who has 
JOB.17.10	“But please, 
JOB.17.10	For I shall not find 
JOB.17.11	My days are past,
JOB.17.11	My purposes are broken off,
JOB.17.11	 the thoughts of my heart.
JOB.17.12	They change the night into day;
JOB.17.12	‘The light 
JOB.17.13	If I wait 
JOB.17.13	If I make my bed in the darkness,
JOB.17.14	If I say to corruption, ‘You

JOB.17.16	Shall 
JOB.18.1	Then 
JOB.18.2	“How long 
JOB.18.2	Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Why are we counted 
JOB.18.3	 regarded as stupid in your sight?
JOB.18.4	You who tear yourself in anger,
JOB.18.4	Shall the earth be forsaken for you?
JOB.18.4	Or shall the rock be removed from its place?
JOB.18.5	“The
JOB.18.5	And the flame of his fire does not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light is dark in his tent,
JOB.18.6	And his lamp beside him is put out.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength are shortened,
JOB.18.7	And 
JOB.18.8	For 
JOB.18.8	And he walks into a snare.
JOB.18.9	The net takes 
JOB.18.10	A noose 
JOB.18.10	And a trap for him in the road.
JOB.18.11	Terrors frighten him on every side,
JOB.18.11	And drive him to his feet.
JOB.18.12	His strength is starved,
JOB.18.12	And 
JOB.18.13	It devours patches of his skin;
JOB.18.13	The firstborn of death devours his limbs.
JOB.18.14	He is uprooted from 
JOB.18.14	And they parade him before the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	They dwell in his tent 
JOB.18.15	Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.
JOB.18.16	His roots are dried out below,
JOB.18.16	And his branch withers above.
JOB.18.17	The memory of him perishes from the earth,
JOB.18.17	And he has no name among the renowned.
JOB.18.18	He is driven from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	And chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He has neither son nor posterity among his people,
JOB.18.19	Nor any remaining in his dwellings.
JOB.18.20	Those in the west are astonished 
JOB.18.20	As those in the east are frightened.
JOB.18.21	Surely such 
JOB.18.21	And this 
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment my soul,
JOB.19.2	And break me in pieces with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times you have reproached me;
JOB.19.3	You are not ashamed 
JOB.19.4	And if indeed I have erred,
JOB.19.4	My error remains with me.
JOB.19.5	If indeed you 
JOB.19.5	And plead my disgrace against me,
JOB.19.6	Know then that 
JOB.19.6	And has surrounded me with His net.
JOB.19.7	“If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard.
JOB.19.7	If I cry aloud, 
JOB.19.8	He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass;
JOB.19.8	And He has set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my glory,
JOB.19.9	And taken the crown 
JOB.19.10	He breaks me down on every side,
JOB.19.10	And I am gone;
JOB.19.10	My 
JOB.19.11	He has also kindled His wrath against me,
JOB.19.11	And 
JOB.19.12	His troops come together
JOB.19.12	And build up their road against me;
JOB.19.12	They encamp all around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“He
JOB.19.13	And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My relatives have failed,
JOB.19.14	And my close friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants,
JOB.19.15	Count me as a stranger;
JOB.19.15	I am an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I call my servant, but he gives no answer;
JOB.19.16	I beg him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is offensive to my wife,
JOB.19.17	And I am repulsive to the children of my own body.
JOB.19.18	Even 
JOB.19.18	I arise, and they speak against me.
JOB.19.19	All my close friends abhor me,
JOB.19.19	And those whom I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh,
JOB.19.20	And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	“Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends,
JOB.19.21	For the hand of God has struck me!
JOB.19.22	Why do you 
JOB.19.22	And are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	“Oh, that my words were written!
JOB.19.23	Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That they were engraved on a rock
JOB.19.24	With an iron pen and lead, forever!
JOB.19.25	For I know 
JOB.19.25	And He shall stand at last on the earth;
JOB.19.26	And after my skin is destroyed, this 
JOB.19.26	That 
JOB.19.27	Whom I shall see for myself,
JOB.19.27	And my eyes shall behold, and not another.
JOB.19.27	 my heart yearns within me!
JOB.19.28	If you should say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’—
JOB.19.28	Since the root of the matter is found in me,
JOB.19.29	Be afraid of the sword for yourselves;
JOB.19.29	For wrath 
JOB.19.29	That you may know 
JOB.20.1	Then 
JOB.20.2	“Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer,
JOB.20.2	Because of the turmoil within me.
JOB.20.3	I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me,
JOB.20.3	And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.
JOB.20.4	“Do you 
JOB.20.4	Since man was placed on earth,
JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	And the joy of the hypocrite is 
JOB.20.6	Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens,
JOB.20.6	And his head reaches to the clouds,
JOB.20.7	 he will perish forever like his own refuse;
JOB.20.7	Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	He will fly away 
JOB.20.8	Yes, he 
JOB.20.9	The eye 
JOB.20.9	Nor will his place behold him anymore.
JOB.20.10	His children will seek the favor of the poor,
JOB.20.10	And his hands will restore his wealth.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of 
JOB.20.11	But it will lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“Though evil is sweet in his mouth,
JOB.20.12	 he hides it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	 he spares it and does not forsake it,
JOB.20.13	But still keeps it in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	 his food in his stomach turns sour;
JOB.20.14	It becomes cobra venom within him.
JOB.20.15	He swallows down riches
JOB.20.15	And vomits them up again;
JOB.20.15	God casts them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He will suck the poison of cobras;
JOB.20.16	The viper’s tongue will slay him.
JOB.20.17	He will not see 
JOB.20.17	The rivers flowing with honey and cream.
JOB.20.18	He will restore that for which he labored,
JOB.20.18	And will not swallow 
JOB.20.18	From the proceeds of business
JOB.20.18	He will get no enjoyment.
JOB.20.19	For he has oppressed 
JOB.20.19	He has violently seized a house which he did not build.
JOB.20.20	“Because
JOB.20.20	He will not save anything he desires.
JOB.20.21	Nothing is left for him to eat;
JOB.20.21	Therefore his well-being will not last.
JOB.20.22	In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress;
JOB.20.22	Every hand of misery will come against him.
JOB.20.23	 he is about to fill his stomach,
JOB.20.23	 will cast on him the fury of His wrath,
JOB.20.23	And will rain 
JOB.20.24	He will flee from the iron weapon;
JOB.20.24	A bronze bow will pierce him through.
JOB.20.25	It is drawn, and comes out of the body;
JOB.20.25	Yes, 
JOB.20.25	Terrors 
JOB.20.26	Total darkness 
JOB.20.26	An unfanned fire will consume him;
JOB.20.26	It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal his iniquity,
JOB.20.27	And the earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house will depart,
JOB.20.29	This 
JOB.20.29	The heritage appointed to him by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my speech,
JOB.21.2	And let this be your consolation.
JOB.21.3	Bear with me that I may speak,
JOB.21.3	And after I have spoken, keep 
JOB.21.4	“As for me, 
JOB.21.4	And if 
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be astonished;
JOB.21.5	Put 
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember I am terrified,
JOB.21.6	And trembling takes hold of my flesh.
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked live 
JOB.21.7	Yes, become mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their descendants are established with them in their sight,
JOB.21.8	And their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses 
JOB.21.9	Neither 
JOB.21.10	Their bull breeds without failure;
JOB.21.10	Their cow calves 
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock,
JOB.21.11	And their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the tambourine and harp,
JOB.21.12	And rejoice to the sound of the flute.
JOB.21.13	They 
JOB.21.13	And in a moment go down to the grave.
JOB.21.14	Yet they say to God, ‘Depart from us,
JOB.21.14	For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who 
JOB.21.15	And 
JOB.21.16	Indeed their prosperity 
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?
JOB.21.17	The sorrows 
JOB.21.18	They are like straw before the wind,
JOB.21.18	And like chaff that a storm carries away.
JOB.21.19	Let Him recompense him, that he may know 
JOB.21.20	Let his eyes see his destruction,
JOB.21.20	And 
JOB.21.21	For what does he care about his household after him,
JOB.21.21	When the number of his months is cut in half?
JOB.21.22	“Can
JOB.21.22	Since He judges those on high?
JOB.21.23	One dies in his full strength,
JOB.21.23	Being wholly at ease and secure;
JOB.21.24	His pails are full of milk,
JOB.21.24	And the marrow of his bones is moist.
JOB.21.25	Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul,
JOB.21.25	Never having eaten with pleasure.
JOB.21.26	They 
JOB.21.26	And worms cover them.
JOB.21.27	“Look, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	And the schemes 
JOB.21.28	For you say,
JOB.21.28	‘Where 
JOB.21.28	And where 
JOB.21.28	The dwelling place of the wicked?’
JOB.21.29	Have you not asked those who travel the road?
JOB.21.29	And do you not know their signs?
JOB.21.30	For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom;
JOB.21.30	They shall be brought out on the day of wrath.
JOB.21.31	Who condemns his way to his face?
JOB.21.31	And who repays him 
JOB.21.32	Yet he shall be brought to the grave,
JOB.21.32	And a vigil kept over the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him;
JOB.21.33	Everyone shall follow him,
JOB.21.33	As countless 
JOB.21.34	How then can you comfort me with empty words,
JOB.21.34	Since falsehood remains in your answers?”
JOB.22.1	Then 
JOB.22.2	“Can
JOB.22.2	Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself?
JOB.22.3	Or 
JOB.22.4	“Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you,
JOB.22.4	And enters into judgment with you?
JOB.22.5	 not your wickedness great,
JOB.22.5	And your iniquity without end?
JOB.22.6	For you have 
JOB.22.6	And stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	You have not given the weary water to drink,
JOB.22.7	And you 
JOB.22.8	But the mighty man possessed the land,
JOB.22.8	And the honorable man dwelt in it.
JOB.22.9	You have sent widows away empty,
JOB.22.9	And the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares 
JOB.22.10	And sudden fear troubles you,
JOB.22.11	Or darkness 
JOB.22.11	And an abundance of 
JOB.22.12	“Is not God in the height of heaven?
JOB.22.12	And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!
JOB.22.13	And you say, 
JOB.22.13	Can He judge through the deep darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see,
JOB.22.14	And He walks above the circle of heaven.’
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the old way
JOB.22.15	Which wicked men have trod,
JOB.22.16	Who 
JOB.22.16	Whose foundations were swept away by a flood?
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Depart from us!
JOB.22.17	What can the Almighty do to them?’
JOB.22.18	Yet He filled their houses with good 
JOB.22.18	But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	“The
JOB.22.19	And the innocent laugh at them:
JOB.22.20	‘Surely our adversaries are cut down,
JOB.22.20	And the fire consumes their remnant.’
JOB.22.21	“Now acquaint yourself with Him, and 
JOB.22.21	Thereby good will come to you.
JOB.22.22	Receive, please, 
JOB.22.22	And 
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up;
JOB.22.23	You will remove iniquity far from your tents.
JOB.22.24	Then you will 
JOB.22.24	And the 
JOB.22.25	Yes, the Almighty will be your gold
JOB.22.25	And your precious silver;
JOB.22.26	For then you will have your 
JOB.22.26	And lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will make your prayer to Him,
JOB.22.27	He will hear you,
JOB.22.27	And you will pay your vows.
JOB.22.28	You will also declare a thing,
JOB.22.28	And it will be established for you;
JOB.22.28	So light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	When they cast 
JOB.22.29	Then 
JOB.22.30	He will 
JOB.22.30	Yes, he will be delivered by the purity of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered and said:
JOB.23.2	“Even today my 
JOB.23.2	My hand is listless because of my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh, that I knew where I might find Him,
JOB.23.3	 I might come to His seat!
JOB.23.4	I would present 
JOB.23.4	And fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would know the words 
JOB.23.5	And understand what He would say to me.
JOB.23.6	Would He contend with me in His great power?
JOB.23.6	No! But He would take 
JOB.23.7	There the upright could reason with Him,
JOB.23.7	And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
JOB.23.8	“Look,
JOB.23.8	And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
JOB.23.9	When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold 
JOB.23.9	When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see 
JOB.23.10	But 
JOB.23.11	My foot has held fast to His steps;
JOB.23.11	I have kept His way and not turned aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the 
JOB.23.12	I have treasured the words of His mouth
JOB.23.12	More than my necessary 
JOB.23.13	“But He 
JOB.23.13	And 
JOB.23.14	For He performs 
JOB.23.14	And many such 
JOB.23.15	Therefore I am terrified at His presence;
JOB.23.15	When I consider 
JOB.23.16	For God 
JOB.23.16	And the Almighty terrifies me;
JOB.23.17	Because I was not 
JOB.23.17	And He did 
JOB.24.1	“
JOB.24.1	Why do those who know Him see not His 
JOB.24.2	“
JOB.24.2	They seize flocks violently and feed 
JOB.24.3	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;
JOB.24.3	They 
JOB.24.4	They push the needy off the road;
JOB.24.4	All the 
JOB.24.5	Indeed, 
JOB.24.5	They go out to their work, searching for food.
JOB.24.5	The wilderness 
JOB.24.6	They gather their fodder in the field
JOB.24.6	And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They 
JOB.24.7	And have no covering in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
JOB.24.8	And 
JOB.24.9	“
JOB.24.9	And take a pledge from the poor.
JOB.24.10	They cause 
JOB.24.10	And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
JOB.24.11	They press out oil within their walls,
JOB.24.11	And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
JOB.24.12	The dying groan in the city,
JOB.24.12	And the souls of the wounded cry out;
JOB.24.12	Yet God does not charge 
JOB.24.13	“There are those who rebel against the light;
JOB.24.13	They do not know its ways
JOB.24.13	Nor abide in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises with the light;
JOB.24.14	He kills the poor and needy;
JOB.24.14	And in the night he is like a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	Saying, ‘No eye will see me’;
JOB.24.15	And he disguises 
JOB.24.16	In the dark they break into houses
JOB.24.16	Which they marked for themselves in the daytime;
JOB.24.16	They do not know the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death;
JOB.24.17	If 
JOB.24.18	“They 
JOB.24.18	Their portion 
JOB.24.19	As drought and heat consume the snow waters,

JOB.24.20	The womb 
JOB.24.20	The worm 
JOB.24.20	He 
JOB.24.20	And wickedness 
JOB.24.21	For he preys on the barren 
JOB.24.21	And does no good for the widow.
JOB.24.22	“But 
JOB.24.22	He rises up, but no 
JOB.24.23	He gives them security, and they rely 
JOB.24.23	Yet 
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a little while,
JOB.24.24	Then they are gone.
JOB.24.24	They are brought low;
JOB.24.24	They are taken out of the way like all 
JOB.24.24	They dry out like the heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	“Now if 
JOB.24.25	And make my speech worth nothing?”
JOB.25.1	Then 
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and fear 
JOB.25.2	He makes peace in His high places.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number to His armies?
JOB.25.3	Upon whom does 
JOB.25.4	How then can man be righteous before God?
JOB.25.4	Or how can he be 
JOB.25.5	If even the moon does not shine,
JOB.25.5	And the stars are not pure in His 
JOB.25.6	How much less man, 
JOB.25.6	And a son of man, 
JOB.26.1	But Job answered and said:
JOB.26.2	“How have you helped 
JOB.26.2	 have you saved the arm 
JOB.26.3	How have you counseled 
JOB.26.3	And 
JOB.26.4	To whom have you uttered words?
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit came from you?
JOB.26.5	“The dead tremble,
JOB.26.5	Those under the waters and those inhabiting them.
JOB.26.6	Sheol 
JOB.26.6	And Destruction has no covering.
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over empty space;
JOB.26.7	 hangs the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	He binds up the water in His thick clouds,
JOB.26.8	Yet the clouds are not broken under it.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of 
JOB.26.9	 spreads His cloud over it.
JOB.26.10	He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters,
JOB.26.10	At the boundary of light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble,
JOB.26.11	And are astonished at His rebuke.
JOB.26.12	He stirs up the sea with His power,
JOB.26.12	And by His understanding He breaks up the storm.
JOB.26.13	By His Spirit He adorned the heavens;
JOB.26.13	His hand pierced 
JOB.26.14	Indeed these 
JOB.26.14	And how small a whisper we hear of Him!
JOB.26.14	But the thunder of His power who can understand?”
JOB.27.1	Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said:
JOB.27.2	“
JOB.27.2	And the Almighty, 
JOB.27.3	As long as my breath 
JOB.27.3	And the breath of God in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	My lips will not speak wickedness,
JOB.27.4	Nor my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me
JOB.27.5	That I should say you are right;
JOB.27.5	Till I die 
JOB.27.6	My righteousness I 
JOB.27.6	My heart shall not reproach 
JOB.27.7	“May my enemy be like the wicked,
JOB.27.7	And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite,
JOB.27.8	Though he may gain 
JOB.27.8	If God takes away his life?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry
JOB.27.9	When trouble comes upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Will he always call on God?
JOB.27.11	“I will teach you about the hand of God;
JOB.27.11	What 
JOB.27.12	Surely all of you have seen 
JOB.27.12	Why then do you behave with complete nonsense?
JOB.27.13	“This
JOB.27.13	And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty:
JOB.27.14	If his children are multiplied, 
JOB.27.14	And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	Those who survive him shall be buried in death,
JOB.27.15	And 
JOB.27.16	Though he heaps up silver like dust,
JOB.27.16	And piles up clothing like clay—
JOB.27.17	He may pile 
JOB.27.17	And the innocent will divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He builds his house like a moth,
JOB.27.18	Like a booth 
JOB.27.19	The rich man will lie down,
JOB.27.19	But not be gathered 
JOB.27.19	He opens his eyes,
JOB.27.19	And he 
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a flood;
JOB.27.20	A tempest steals him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;
JOB.27.21	It sweeps him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	It hurls against him and does not 
JOB.27.22	He flees desperately from its power.
JOB.27.23	 shall clap their hands at him,
JOB.27.23	And shall hiss him out of his place.
JOB.28.1	“Surely there is a mine for silver,
JOB.28.1	And a place 
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from the earth,
JOB.28.2	And copper 
JOB.28.3	 puts an end to darkness,
JOB.28.3	And searches every recess
JOB.28.3	For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death.
JOB.28.4	He breaks open a shaft away from people;
JOB.28.4	They hang far away from men;
JOB.28.4	They swing to and fro.
JOB.28.5	But underneath it is turned up as by fire;
JOB.28.6	Its stones 
JOB.28.6	And it contains gold dust.
JOB.28.7	 path no bird knows,
JOB.28.7	Nor has the falcon’s eye seen it.
JOB.28.8	The proud lions have not trodden it,
JOB.28.8	Nor has the fierce lion passed over it.
JOB.28.9	He puts his hand on the flint;
JOB.28.9	He overturns the mountains at the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cuts out channels in the rocks,
JOB.28.10	And his eye sees every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He dams up the streams from trickling;
JOB.28.12	“But
JOB.28.12	And where 
JOB.28.13	Man does not know its 
JOB.28.13	Nor is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep says, 
JOB.28.14	And the sea says, 
JOB.28.15	It 
JOB.28.15	Nor can silver be weighed 
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	In precious onyx or sapphire.
JOB.28.17	Neither 
JOB.28.17	Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral or quartz,
JOB.28.18	For the price of wisdom 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,
JOB.28.19	Nor can it be valued in pure 
JOB.28.20	“From
JOB.28.20	And where 
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of all living,
JOB.28.21	And concealed from the birds of the air.
JOB.28.22	Destruction and Death say,
JOB.28.22	‘We have heard a report about it with our ears.’
JOB.28.23	God understands its way,
JOB.28.23	And He knows its place.
JOB.28.24	For He looks to the ends of the earth,
JOB.28.25	To establish a weight for the wind,
JOB.28.25	And apportion the waters by measure.
JOB.28.26	When He 
JOB.28.26	And a path for the thunderbolt,
JOB.28.27	Then He saw 
JOB.28.27	He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And to man He said,
JOB.28.28	‘Behold, 
JOB.28.28	And to depart from evil 
JOB.29.1	Job further continued his discourse, and said:
JOB.29.2	“Oh, that I were as 
JOB.29.2	As 
JOB.29.3	When His lamp shone upon my head,
JOB.29.4	Just as I was in the days of my prime,
JOB.29.4	When 
JOB.29.5	When the Almighty 
JOB.29.5	 my children 
JOB.29.6	When 
JOB.29.6	And 
JOB.29.7	“When I went out to the gate by the city,
JOB.29.7	 I took my seat in the open square,
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me and hid,
JOB.29.8	And the aged arose 
JOB.29.9	The princes refrained from talking,
JOB.29.9	And 
JOB.29.10	The voice of nobles was hushed,
JOB.29.10	And their 
JOB.29.11	When the ear heard, then it blessed me,
JOB.29.11	And when the eye saw, then it approved me;
JOB.29.12	Because 
JOB.29.12	The fatherless and 
JOB.29.13	The blessing of a perishing 
JOB.29.13	And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
JOB.29.14	My justice 
JOB.29.15	I 
JOB.29.15	And I 
JOB.29.16	I 
JOB.29.16	And 
JOB.29.17	I broke 
JOB.29.17	And plucked the victim from his teeth.
JOB.29.18	“Then I said, 
JOB.29.18	And multiply 
JOB.29.19	My root 
JOB.29.19	And the dew lies all night on my branch.
JOB.29.20	My glory 
JOB.29.20	And my 
JOB.29.21	“
JOB.29.21	And kept silence for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they did not speak again,
JOB.29.22	And my speech settled on them 
JOB.29.23	They waited for me 
JOB.29.23	And they opened their mouth wide 
JOB.29.24	 I mocked at them, they did not believe 
JOB.29.24	And the light of my countenance they did not cast down.
JOB.29.25	I chose the way for them, and sat as chief;
JOB.29.25	So I dwelt as a king in the army,
JOB.29.25	As one 
JOB.30.1	“But now they mock at me, 
JOB.30.1	Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	Indeed, what 
JOB.30.2	Their vigor has perished.
JOB.30.3	Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste,
JOB.30.4	Who pluck mallow by the bushes,
JOB.30.4	And broom tree roots 
JOB.30.5	They were driven out from among 
JOB.30.5	They shouted at them as 
JOB.30.6	 caves of the earth and the rocks.
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they brayed,
JOB.30.7	Under the nettles they nestled.
JOB.30.8	Yes, sons of vile men;
JOB.30.8	They were scourged from the land.
JOB.30.9	“And
JOB.30.9	Yes, I am their byword.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they keep far from me;
JOB.30.10	They do not hesitate 
JOB.30.11	Because 
JOB.30.11	They have cast off restraint before me.
JOB.30.12	At 
JOB.30.12	They push away my feet,
JOB.30.12	And 
JOB.30.13	They break up my path,
JOB.30.13	They promote my calamity;
JOB.30.13	They have no helper.
JOB.30.14	They come as broad breakers;
JOB.30.14	Under the ruinous storm they roll along.
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me;
JOB.30.15	They pursue my honor as the wind,
JOB.30.15	And my prosperity has passed like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“And
JOB.30.16	The days of affliction take hold of me.
JOB.30.17	My bones are pierced in me at night,
JOB.30.17	And my gnawing pains take no rest.
JOB.30.18	By great force my garment is disfigured;
JOB.30.18	It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the mire,
JOB.30.19	And I have become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	“I 
JOB.30.20	I stand up, and You regard me.
JOB.30.21	 You have become cruel to me;
JOB.30.21	With the strength of Your hand You 
JOB.30.22	You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride 
JOB.30.22	You spoil my success.
JOB.30.23	For I know 
JOB.30.23	And 
JOB.30.24	“Surely He would not stretch out 
JOB.30.24	If they cry out when He destroys 
JOB.30.25	Have I not wept for him who was in trouble?
JOB.30.25	Has 
JOB.30.26	But when I looked for good, evil came 
JOB.30.26	And when I waited for light, then came darkness.
JOB.30.27	My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest;
JOB.30.27	Days of affliction confront me.
JOB.30.28	I go about mourning, but not in the sun;
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly 
JOB.30.29	I am a brother of jackals,
JOB.30.29	And a companion of ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin grows black and falls from me;
JOB.30.30	My bones burn with fever.
JOB.30.31	My harp is 
JOB.30.31	And my flute to the voice of those who weep.
JOB.31.1	“I have made a covenant with my eyes;
JOB.31.1	Why then should I look upon a 
JOB.31.2	For what 
JOB.31.2	And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
JOB.31.3	 it not destruction for the wicked,
JOB.31.3	And disaster for the workers of iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Does He not see my ways,
JOB.31.4	And count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falsehood,
JOB.31.5	Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,
JOB.31.6	Let me be weighed on honest scales,
JOB.31.6	That God may know my 
JOB.31.7	If my step has turned from the way,
JOB.31.7	Or 
JOB.31.7	Or if any spot adheres to my hands,
JOB.31.8	Yes, let my harvest be rooted out.
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
JOB.31.9	Or 
JOB.31.10	 let my wife grind for 
JOB.31.10	And let others bow down over her.
JOB.31.11	For that 
JOB.31.11	Yes, 
JOB.31.12	For that 
JOB.31.12	And would root out all my increase.
JOB.31.13	“If I have 
JOB.31.13	When they complained against me,
JOB.31.14	What then shall I do when 
JOB.31.14	When He punishes, how shall I answer Him?
JOB.31.15	Did not He who made me in the womb make them?
JOB.31.15	Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	“If I have kept the poor from 
JOB.31.16	Or caused the eyes of the widow to 
JOB.31.17	Or eaten my morsel by myself,
JOB.31.17	So that the fatherless could not eat of it
JOB.31.18	(But from my youth I reared him as a father,
JOB.31.18	And from my mother’s womb I guided 
JOB.31.19	If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,
JOB.31.19	Or any poor 
JOB.31.20	If his heart has not 
JOB.31.20	And 
JOB.31.21	If I have raised my hand 
JOB.31.21	When I saw I had help in the gate;
JOB.31.22	 let my arm fall from my shoulder,
JOB.31.22	Let my arm be torn from the socket.
JOB.31.23	For 
JOB.31.23	And because of His magnificence I cannot endure.
JOB.31.24	“If
JOB.31.24	Or said to fine gold, ‘
JOB.31.25	If I have rejoiced because my wealth 
JOB.31.25	And because my hand had gained much;
JOB.31.26	If I have observed the sun when it shines,
JOB.31.26	Or the moon moving 
JOB.31.27	So that my heart has been secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	And my mouth has kissed my hand;
JOB.31.28	This also 
JOB.31.28	For I would have denied God 
JOB.31.29	“If
JOB.31.29	Or lifted myself up when evil found him
JOB.31.30	(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	By asking for a curse on his soul);
JOB.31.31	If the men of my tent have not said,
JOB.31.31	‘Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?’
JOB.31.32	(
JOB.31.32	 I have opened my doors to the traveler);
JOB.31.33	If I have covered my transgressions 
JOB.31.33	By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
JOB.31.34	Because I feared the great 
JOB.31.34	And dreaded the contempt of families,
JOB.31.34	So that I kept silence
JOB.31.34	 did not go out of the door—
JOB.31.35	Oh, that I had one to hear me!
JOB.31.35	Here is my mark.
JOB.31.35	that the Almighty would answer me,
JOB.31.35	 my Prosecutor had written a book!
JOB.31.36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,
JOB.31.36	 bind it on me 
JOB.31.37	I would declare to Him the number of my steps;
JOB.31.37	Like a prince I would approach Him.
JOB.31.38	“If my land cries out against me,
JOB.31.38	And its furrows weep together;
JOB.31.39	If 
JOB.31.39	Or 
JOB.31.40	 let 
JOB.31.40	And weeds instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased answering Job, because he 
JOB.32.2	Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the 
JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and 
JOB.32.4	Now because they 
JOB.32.5	When Elihu saw that 
JOB.32.6	So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said:
JOB.32.6	“I 
JOB.32.6	Therefore I was afraid,
JOB.32.6	And dared not declare my opinion to you.
JOB.32.7	I said, ‘Age should speak,
JOB.32.7	And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’
JOB.32.8	But 
JOB.32.8	And 
JOB.32.9	Great men are not 
JOB.32.9	Nor do the aged 
JOB.32.10	“Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me,
JOB.32.10	I also will declare my opinion.’
JOB.32.11	Indeed I waited for your words,
JOB.32.11	I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	I paid close attention to you;
JOB.32.12	And surely not one of you convinced Job,
JOB.32.12	 answered his words—
JOB.32.13	Lest you say,
JOB.32.13	‘We have found wisdom’;
JOB.32.13	God will vanquish him, not man.
JOB.32.14	Now he has not directed 
JOB.32.14	So I will not answer him with your words.
JOB.32.15	“They are dismayed and answer no more;
JOB.32.15	Words escape them.
JOB.32.16	And I have waited, because they did not speak,
JOB.32.16	Because they stood still 
JOB.32.17	I also will answer my part,
JOB.32.17	I too will declare my opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words;
JOB.32.18	The spirit within me compels me.
JOB.32.19	Indeed my belly 
JOB.32.19	It is ready to burst like new wineskins.
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may find relief;
JOB.32.20	I must open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone;
JOB.32.21	Nor let me flatter any man.
JOB.32.22	For I do not know how to flatter,
JOB.32.22	 my Maker would soon take me 
JOB.33.1	“But please, Job, hear my speech,
JOB.33.1	And listen to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Now, I open my mouth;
JOB.33.2	My tongue speaks in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My words 
JOB.33.3	My lips utter pure knowledge.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	If you can answer me,
JOB.33.5	Set 
JOB.33.5	Take your stand.
JOB.33.6	Truly I 
JOB.33.6	I also have been formed out of clay.
JOB.33.7	Surely no fear of me will terrify you,
JOB.33.7	Nor will my hand be heavy on you.
JOB.33.8	“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	And I have heard the sound of 
JOB.33.9	‘I
JOB.33.9	I 
JOB.33.10	Yet He finds occasions against me,
JOB.33.10	He counts me as His enemy;
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks,
JOB.33.11	He watches all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	“Look, 
JOB.33.12	I will answer you,
JOB.33.12	For God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why do you 
JOB.33.13	For He does not give an accounting of any of His words.
JOB.33.14	For God may speak in one way, or in another,
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	When deep sleep falls upon men,
JOB.33.15	While slumbering on their beds,
JOB.33.16	Then He opens the ears of men,
JOB.33.16	And seals their instruction.
JOB.33.17	In order to turn man 
JOB.33.17	And conceal pride from man,
JOB.33.18	He keeps back his soul from the Pit,
JOB.33.18	And his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	“
JOB.33.19	And with strong 
JOB.33.20	So that his life abhors 
JOB.33.20	And his soul succulent food.
JOB.33.21	His flesh wastes away from sight,
JOB.33.21	And his bones stick out 
JOB.33.22	Yes, his soul draws near the Pit,
JOB.33.22	And his life to the executioners.
JOB.33.23	“If there is a messenger for him,
JOB.33.23	A mediator, one among a thousand,
JOB.33.23	To show man His uprightness,
JOB.33.24	Then He is gracious to him, and says,
JOB.33.24	‘Deliver him from going down to the Pit;
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom’;
JOB.33.25	His flesh shall be young like a child’s,
JOB.33.25	He shall return to the days of his youth.
JOB.33.26	He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him,
JOB.33.26	He shall see His face with joy,
JOB.33.26	For He restores to man His righteousness.
JOB.33.27	Then he looks at men and 
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned, and perverted 
JOB.33.27	And it 
JOB.33.28	He will 
JOB.33.28	And his life shall see the light.
JOB.33.29	“Behold, God works all these 
JOB.33.29	Twice, 
JOB.33.30	To bring back his soul from the Pit,
JOB.33.30	That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
JOB.33.31	“Give ear, Job, listen to me;
JOB.33.31	Hold your peace, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me;
JOB.33.32	Speak, for I desire to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not, 
JOB.33.33	Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Elihu further answered and said:
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise 
JOB.34.2	Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear tests words
JOB.34.3	As the palate tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose justice for ourselves;
JOB.34.4	Let us know among ourselves what 
JOB.34.5	“For Job has said, 
JOB.34.5	But 
JOB.34.6	Should I lie concerning my right?
JOB.34.6	My wound 
JOB.34.7	What man 
JOB.34.7	 drinks scorn like water,
JOB.34.8	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,
JOB.34.8	And walks with wicked men?
JOB.34.9	For 
JOB.34.9	That he should delight in God.’
JOB.34.10	“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:
JOB.34.10	Far be it from God 
JOB.34.10	And 
JOB.34.11	For He repays man 
JOB.34.11	And makes man to find a reward according to 
JOB.34.12	Surely God will never do wickedly,
JOB.34.12	Nor will the Almighty 
JOB.34.13	Who gave Him charge over the earth?
JOB.34.13	Or who appointed 
JOB.34.14	If He should set His heart on it,
JOB.34.14	 He should 
JOB.34.15	All flesh would perish together,
JOB.34.15	And man would return to dust.
JOB.34.16	“If 
JOB.34.16	Listen to the sound of my words:
JOB.34.17	Should one who hates justice govern?
JOB.34.17	Will you 
JOB.34.18	 to nobles, ‘
JOB.34.19	Yet He 
JOB.34.19	Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor;
JOB.34.19	For 
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die, 
JOB.34.20	The people are shaken and pass away;
JOB.34.20	The mighty are taken away without a hand.
JOB.34.21	“For
JOB.34.21	And He sees all his steps.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness nor shadow of death
JOB.34.22	Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For He need not further consider a man,
JOB.34.23	That he should go before God in judgment.
JOB.34.24	He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry,
JOB.34.24	And sets others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Therefore He knows their works;
JOB.34.25	He overthrows 
JOB.34.25	And they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	He strikes them as wicked 
JOB.34.26	In the open sight of others,
JOB.34.27	Because they 
JOB.34.27	And 
JOB.34.28	So that they 
JOB.34.28	For He 
JOB.34.29	When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble?
JOB.34.29	And when He hides 
JOB.34.29	Whether 
JOB.34.30	That the hypocrite should not reign,
JOB.34.30	Lest the people be ensnared.
JOB.34.31	“For has 
JOB.34.31	‘I have borne 
JOB.34.31	I will offend no more;
JOB.34.32	Teach me 
JOB.34.32	If I have done iniquity, I will do no more’?
JOB.34.33	Should He repay 
JOB.34.33	 because you disavow it?
JOB.34.33	You must choose, and not I;
JOB.34.33	Therefore speak what you know.
JOB.34.34	“Men of understanding say to me,
JOB.34.34	Wise men who listen to me:
JOB.34.35	‘Job
JOB.34.35	His words 
JOB.34.36	Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost,
JOB.34.36	Because 
JOB.34.37	For he adds 
JOB.34.37	He claps 
JOB.34.37	And multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	Moreover Elihu answered and said:
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is right?
JOB.35.2	Do you say,
JOB.35.2	‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?
JOB.35.3	For 
JOB.35.3	‘What advantage will it be to You?
JOB.35.3	What profit shall I have, more than 
JOB.35.4	“I will answer you,
JOB.35.4	And 
JOB.35.5	Look to the heavens and see;
JOB.35.5	And behold the clouds—
JOB.35.5	They are higher than you.
JOB.35.6	If you sin, what do you accomplish 
JOB.35.6	Or, 
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give Him?
JOB.35.7	Or what does He receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness affects a man such as you,
JOB.35.8	And your righteousness a son of man.
JOB.35.9	“Because
JOB.35.9	They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But no one says, 
JOB.35.10	Who gives songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	Who 
JOB.35.11	And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?’
JOB.35.12	There they cry out, but He does not answer,
JOB.35.12	Because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not listen to empty 
JOB.35.13	Nor will the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	Although you say you do not see Him,
JOB.35.14	 justice 
JOB.35.15	And now, because He has not 
JOB.35.15	Nor taken much notice of folly,
JOB.35.16	Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain;
JOB.35.16	He multiplies words without knowledge.”
JOB.36.1	Elihu also proceeded and said:
JOB.36.2	“Bear with me a little, and I will show you
JOB.36.2	That 
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar;
JOB.36.3	I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words 
JOB.36.4	One who is perfect in knowledge 
JOB.36.5	“Behold, God 
JOB.36.6	He does not preserve the life of the wicked,
JOB.36.6	But gives justice to the 
JOB.36.7	He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous;
JOB.36.7	But 
JOB.36.7	For He has seated them forever,
JOB.36.7	And they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And 
JOB.36.8	Held in the cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	Then He tells them their work and their transgressions—
JOB.36.9	That they have acted defiantly.
JOB.36.10	He also opens their ear to instruction,
JOB.36.10	And commands that they turn from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve 
JOB.36.11	They shall 
JOB.36.11	And their years in pleasures.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not obey,
JOB.36.12	They shall perish by the sword,
JOB.36.12	And they shall die without 
JOB.36.13	“But the hypocrites in heart 
JOB.36.13	They do not cry for help when He binds them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth,
JOB.36.14	And their life 
JOB.36.15	He delivers the poor in their affliction,
JOB.36.15	And opens their ears in oppression.
JOB.36.16	“Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress,
JOB.36.16	 a broad place where 
JOB.36.16	And 
JOB.36.17	But you are filled with the judgment due the 
JOB.36.17	Judgment and justice take hold 
JOB.36.18	Because 
JOB.36.18	For 
JOB.36.19	Will your riches,
JOB.36.19	Or all the mighty forces,
JOB.36.19	Keep you from distress?
JOB.36.20	Do not desire the night,
JOB.36.20	When people are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, 
JOB.36.21	For 
JOB.36.22	“Behold, God is exalted by His power;
JOB.36.22	Who teaches like Him?
JOB.36.23	Who has assigned Him His way,
JOB.36.23	Or who has said, ‘You have done 
JOB.36.24	“Remember to 
JOB.36.24	Of which men have sung.
JOB.36.25	Everyone has seen it;
JOB.36.25	Man looks on 
JOB.36.26	“Behold, God

JOB.36.30	Look, He 
JOB.36.30	And covers the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For 
JOB.36.31	He 
JOB.36.32	He covers 
JOB.36.32	And commands it to strike.
JOB.36.33	His thunder declares it,

JOB.37.2	And the rumbling 
JOB.37.3	He sends it forth under the whole heaven,
JOB.37.3	His lightning to the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it 
JOB.37.4	He thunders with His majestic voice,
JOB.37.4	And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thunders marvelously with His voice;
JOB.37.5	He does great things which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For 
JOB.37.6	Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength.

JOB.37.10	And the broad waters are frozen.
JOB.37.11	Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds;
JOB.37.11	He scatters His bright clouds.
JOB.37.12	And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance,
JOB.37.12	That they may

JOB.41.27	He regards iron as straw,
JOB.41.27	 bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee;
JOB.41.28	Slingstones become like stubble to him.
JOB.41.29	Darts are regarded as straw;

PSA.18.38	I have wounded them,
PSA.18.38	So that they could not rise;
PSA.18.38	They have fallen under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For You have armed me with strength for the battle;
PSA.18.39	You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
PSA.18.40	You have also given me the necks of my enemies,
PSA.18.40	So that I destroyed those who hated me.
PSA.18.41	They cried out, but 
PSA.18.41	 to the 
PSA.18.42	Then I beat them as fine as the dust before the wind;
PSA.18.42	I 
PSA.18.43	You have delivered me from the strivings of the people;
PSA.18.43	You have made me the head of the nations;
PSA.18.43	A people I have not known shall serve me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me they obey me;
PSA.18.44	The foreigners submit to me.
PSA.18.45	The foreigners fade away,
PSA.18.45	And come frightened from their hideouts.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	Blessed 
PSA.18.46	Let the God of my salvation be exalted.
PSA.18.47	And subdues the peoples under me;
PSA.18.48	He delivers me from my enemies.
PSA.18.48	You also lift me up above those who rise against me;
PSA.18.48	You have delivered me from the violent man.
PSA.18.49	Therefore I will give thanks to You, O 
PSA.18.49	And sing praises to Your name.
PSA.18.50	Great deliverance He gives to His king,
PSA.18.50	And shows mercy to His anointed,
PSA.18.50	To David and his descendants forevermore.

PSA.19.4	Their line has gone out through all the earth,
PSA.19.4	And their words to the end of the world.
PSA.19.4	In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,
PSA.19.5	Which 
PSA.19.5	 rejoices like a strong man to run its race.
PSA.19.6	Its rising 
PSA.19.6	And its circuit to the other end;

PSA.20.3	And accept your burnt sacrifice.
PSA.20.4	May He grant you according to your heart’s 
PSA.20.4	And 
PSA.20.5	We will rejoice in your salvation,

PSA.20.7	But we will remember the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They have bowed down and fallen;
PSA.20.8	But we have risen and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Save, 
PSA.20.9	May the King answer us when we call.
PSA.21.1	The king shall have joy in Your strength, O 
PSA.21.1	And in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

PSA.21.4	He asked life from You, 
PSA.21.4	Length of days forever and ever.
PSA.21.5	His glory 
PSA.21.5	Honor and majesty You have placed upon him.
PSA.21.6	For You have made him most blessed forever;
PSA.21.6	You have made him exceedingly glad with Your presence.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.7	And through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
PSA.21.8	Your hand will find all Your enemies;

PSA.21.9	And the fire shall devour them.
PSA.21.10	Their offspring You shall destroy from the earth,
PSA.21.10	And their descendants from among the sons of men.
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against You;
PSA.21.11	They devised a plot 
PSA.21.12	Therefore You will make them turn their back;

PSA.21.13	We will sing and praise Your power.
PSA.22.1	My 
PSA.22.2	O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not hear;
PSA.22.2	And in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA.22.3	But You 
PSA.22.3	Enthroned in the 
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in You;
PSA.22.4	They trusted, and You delivered them.
PSA.22.5	They cried to You, and were delivered;
PSA.22.5	They trusted in You, and were not ashamed.
PSA.22.6	But I 
PSA.22.6	A reproach of men, and despised by the people.
PSA.22.7	All those who see Me ridicule Me;
PSA.22.7	They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, 
PSA.22.8	“He
PSA.22.8	Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!”
PSA.22.9	But You 
PSA.22.9	You made Me trust 
PSA.22.10	I was cast upon You from birth.
PSA.22.10	From My mother’s womb
PSA.22.10	You 
PSA.22.11	Be not far from Me,
PSA.22.11	For trouble 
PSA.22.11	For 
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have surrounded Me;
PSA.22.12	Strong 
PSA.22.13	They gape at Me 
PSA.22.13	 a raging and roaring lion.
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water,
PSA.22.14	And all My bones are out of joint;
PSA.22.14	My heart is like wax;
PSA.22.14	It has melted within Me.
PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd,
PSA.22.15	And 
PSA.22.15	You have brought Me to the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have surrounded Me;
PSA.22.16	The congregation of the wicked has enclosed Me.
PSA.22.16	They pierced My hands and My feet;
PSA.22.17	I can count all My bones.
PSA.22.17	They look 
PSA.22.18	They divide My garments among them,
PSA.22.18	And for My clothing they cast lots.
PSA.22.19	But You, O 
PSA.22.19	O My Strength, hasten to help Me!
PSA.22.20	Deliver Me from the sword,
PSA.22.20	My precious 
PSA.22.21	Save Me from the lion’s mouth
PSA.22.21	And from the horns of the wild oxen!
PSA.22.21	You have answered Me.
PSA.22.22	I will declare Your name to 
PSA.22.22	In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.
PSA.22.23	You who fear the 
PSA.22.23	All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him,
PSA.22.23	And fear Him, all you offspring of Israel!
PSA.22.24	For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted;
PSA.22.24	Nor has He hidden His face from Him;
PSA.22.24	But 
PSA.22.25	My praise 
PSA.22.25	I will pay My vows before those who fear Him.
PSA.22.26	The poor shall eat and be satisfied;
PSA.22.26	Those who seek Him will praise the 
PSA.22.26	Let your heart live forever!
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the world
PSA.22.27	Shall remember and turn to the 
PSA.22.27	And all the families of the nations
PSA.22.27	Shall worship before You.
PSA.22.28	For the kingdom 
PSA.22.28	And He rules over the nations.
PSA.22.29	All the prosperous of the earth
PSA.22.29	Shall eat and worship;
PSA.22.29	All those who go down to the dust
PSA.22.29	Shall bow before Him,
PSA.22.29	Even he who cannot keep himself alive.
PSA.22.30	A posterity shall serve Him.
PSA.22.30	It will be recounted of the Lord to the 
PSA.22.31	They will come and declare His righteousness to a people who will be born,
PSA.22.31	That He has done 
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.1	I shall not want.
PSA.23.2	He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
PSA.23.2	He leads me beside the still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restores my soul;
PSA.23.3	He leads me in the paths of righteousness
PSA.23.3	For His name’s sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of 
PSA.23.4	I will fear no evil;
PSA.23.4	For You 
PSA.23.4	Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	You 
PSA.23.5	You 
PSA.23.5	My cup runs over.
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
PSA.23.6	All the days of my life;
PSA.23.6	And I will dwell in the house of the 
PSA.23.6	Forever.
PSA.24.1	The 
PSA.24.1	The world and those who dwell therein.
PSA.24.2	For He has 
PSA.24.2	And established it upon the waters.
PSA.24.3	Who may ascend into the hill of the 
PSA.24.3	Or who may stand in His holy place?
PSA.24.4	He who has 
PSA.24.4	Who has not lifted up his soul to an idol,
PSA.24.4	Nor 
PSA.24.5	He shall receive blessing from the 
PSA.24.5	And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
PSA.24.6	This 
PSA.24.6	Who seek Your face.
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O you gates!
PSA.24.7	And be lifted up, you everlasting doors!
PSA.24.7	And the King of glory shall come in.

PSA.25.2	O my God, I 
PSA.25.2	Let me not be ashamed;
PSA.25.2	Let not my enemies triumph over me.
PSA.25.3	Indeed, let no one who waits on You be ashamed;
PSA.25.3	Let those be ashamed who deal treacherously without cause.
PSA.25.4	Show me Your ways, O 
PSA.25.4	Teach me Your paths.
PSA.25.5	Lead me in Your truth and teach me,
PSA.25.5	For You 
PSA.25.5	On You I wait all the day.

PSA.25.12	Who 
PSA.25.12	Him shall He teach in the way He chooses.
PSA.25.13	He himself shall dwell in prosperity,
PSA.25.13	And 
PSA.25.14	The secret of the 
PSA.25.14	And He will show them His covenant.
PSA.25.15	My eyes 
PSA.25.15	For He shall pluck my feet out of the net.
PSA.25.16	Turn Yourself to me, and have mercy on me,
PSA.25.16	For I 
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart have enlarged;
PSA.25.17	Bring me out of my distresses!
PSA.25.18	Look on my affliction and my pain,
PSA.25.18	And forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider my enemies, for they are many;
PSA.25.19	And they hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA.25.20	Keep my soul, and deliver me;
PSA.25.20	Let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in You.
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,
PSA.25.21	For I wait for You.

PSA.26.2	Try my mind and my heart.
PSA.26.3	For Your lovingkindness 
PSA.26.3	And 
PSA.26.4	I have not 
PSA.26.4	Nor will I go in with hypocrites.
PSA.26.5	I have 
PSA.26.5	And will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I will wash my hands in innocence;
PSA.26.6	So I will go about Your altar, O 
PSA.26.7	That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving,
PSA.26.7	And tell of all Your wondrous works.
PSA.26.8	, 
PSA.26.8	And the place where Your glory dwells.
PSA.26.9	Do not gather my soul with sinners,
PSA.26.9	Nor my life with bloodthirsty men,
PSA.26.10	In whose hands 
PSA.26.10	And whose right hand is full of 
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in my integrity;
PSA.26.11	Redeem me and be merciful to me.
PSA.26.12	My foot stands in an even place;
PSA.26.12	In the congregations I will bless the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	Whom shall I fear?
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	Of whom shall I be afraid?
PSA.27.2	When the wicked came against me
PSA.27.2	To 
PSA.27.2	My enemies and foes,
PSA.27.2	They stumbled and fell.
PSA.27.3	Though an army may encamp against me,
PSA.27.3	My heart shall not fear;
PSA.27.3	Though war may rise against me,
PSA.27.3	In this I 
PSA.27.4	One 
PSA.27.4	That will I seek:
PSA.27.4	That I may 
PSA.27.4	All the days of my life,
PSA.27.4	To behold the beauty of the 
PSA.27.4	And to inquire in His temple.
PSA.27.5	For 
PSA.27.5	He shall hide me in His pavilion;
PSA.27.5	In the secret place of His tabernacle
PSA.27.5	He shall hide me;
PSA.27.5	He shall 
PSA.27.6	And now 
PSA.27.6	Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle;
PSA.27.6	I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the 
PSA.27.7	Hear, O 
PSA.27.7	Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
PSA.27.8	My heart said to You, “Your face, 
PSA.27.9	Do not hide Your face from me;
PSA.27.9	Do not turn Your servant away in anger;
PSA.27.9	You have been my help;
PSA.27.9	Do not leave me nor forsake me,
PSA.27.9	O God of my salvation.
PSA.27.10	When my father and my mother forsake me,
PSA.27.10	Then the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me Your way, O 
PSA.27.11	And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.
PSA.27.12	Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries;

PSA.28.1	I become like those who go down to the pit.
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplications
PSA.28.2	When I cry to You,
PSA.28.2	When I lift up my hands 
PSA.28.3	Do not take me away with the wicked
PSA.28.3	And with the workers of iniquity,
PSA.28.3	Who speak peace to their neighbors,
PSA.28.3	But evil 
PSA.28.4	Give them according to their deeds,
PSA.28.4	And according to the wickedness of their endeavors;
PSA.28.4	Give them according to the work of their hands;
PSA.28.4	Render to them what they deserve.
PSA.28.5	Because 
PSA.28.5	Nor the operation of His hands,
PSA.28.5	He shall destroy them
PSA.28.5	And not build them up.
PSA.28.6	Blessed 
PSA.28.6	Because He has heard the voice of my supplications!

PSA.29.10	The 
PSA.29.10	And 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.29.11	The

PSA.30.4	And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.
PSA.30.5	For 
PSA.30.5	His favor 
PSA.30.5	Weeping may endure for a night,
PSA.30.5	But joy 
PSA.30.6	Now in my prosperity I said,
PSA.30.6	“I shall never be moved.”
PSA.30.7	, by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong;
PSA.30.7	You hid Your face, 
PSA.30.8	I cried out to You, O 
PSA.30.8	And to the 
PSA.30.9	“What profit 
PSA.30.9	When I go down to the pit?
PSA.30.9	Will the dust praise You?
PSA.30.9	Will it declare Your truth?
PSA.30.10	Hear, O 
PSA.30.10	, be my helper!”
PSA.30.11	You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
PSA.30.11	You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,
PSA.30.12	To the end that 
PSA.30.12	O 
PSA.31.1	In 
PSA.31.1	Let me never be ashamed;
PSA.31.1	Deliver me in Your righteousness.
PSA.31.2	Bow down Your ear to me,
PSA.31.2	Deliver me speedily;
PSA.31.2	Be my rock of refuge,
PSA.31.2	A fortress of defense to save me.
PSA.31.3	For You 
PSA.31.3	Therefore, 
PSA.31.3	Lead me and guide me.
PSA.31.4	Pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me,
PSA.31.4	For You 
PSA.31.5	Into Your hand I commit my spirit;
PSA.31.5	You have redeemed me, O 
PSA.31.6	I have hated those 
PSA.31.6	But I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy,
PSA.31.7	For You have considered my trouble;
PSA.31.7	You have 
PSA.31.8	And have not 
PSA.31.8	You have set my feet in a wide place.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy on me, O 
PSA.31.9	My eye wastes away with grief,
PSA.31.9	 my soul and my body!
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with grief,
PSA.31.10	And my years with sighing;
PSA.31.10	My strength fails because of my iniquity,
PSA.31.10	And my bones waste away.
PSA.31.11	I am a reproach among all my enemies,
PSA.31.11	But 
PSA.31.11	And 
PSA.31.11	Those who see me outside flee from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind;
PSA.31.12	I am like a broken vessel.
PSA.31.13	For I hear the slander of many;
PSA.31.13	Fear 
PSA.31.13	While they 
PSA.31.13	They scheme to take away my life.
PSA.31.14	But as for me, I trust in You, O 
PSA.31.14	I say, “You 
PSA.31.15	My times 
PSA.31.15	Deliver me from the hand of my enemies,
PSA.31.15	And from those who persecute me.
PSA.31.16	Make Your face shine upon Your servant;
PSA.31.16	Save me for Your mercies’ sake.
PSA.31.17	Do not let me be ashamed, O 
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be ashamed;
PSA.31.17	Let them be silent in the grave.
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be put to silence,
PSA.31.18	Which 
PSA.31.19	Oh, how great 
PSA.31.19	Which You have laid up for those who fear You,
PSA.31.19	 You have prepared for those who trust in You
PSA.31.19	In the presence of the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence
PSA.31.20	From the plots of man;
PSA.31.20	You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion
PSA.31.20	From the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed 
PSA.31.21	For 
PSA.31.22	For I said in my haste,
PSA.31.22	“I am cut off from before Your eyes”;
PSA.31.22	Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplications
PSA.31.22	When I cried out to You.
PSA.31.23	Oh, love the 
PSA.31.23	 the 
PSA.31.23	And fully repays the proud person.
PSA.31.24	Be of good courage,
PSA.31.24	And He shall strengthen your heart,
PSA.31.24	All you who hope in the 
PSA.32.1	Blessed 
PSA.32.1	 sin 
PSA.32.2	Blessed 
PSA.32.2	And 
PSA.32.3	When I kept silent, my bones grew old
PSA.32.3	Through my groaning all the day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night Your 
PSA.32.4	My vitality was turned into the drought of summer.
PSA.32.5	I acknowledged my sin to You,
PSA.32.5	And my iniquity I have not hidden.
PSA.32.5	I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the

PSA.35.2	And stand up for my help.
PSA.35.3	Also draw out the spear,
PSA.35.3	And stop those who pursue me.
PSA.35.3	Say to my soul,
PSA.35.3	“I 
PSA.35.4	Let those be put to shame and brought to dishonor
PSA.35.4	Who seek after my life;
PSA.35.4	Let those be 
PSA.35.4	Who plot my hurt.
PSA.35.5	Let them be like chaff before the wind,
PSA.35.5	And let the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be 
PSA.35.6	And let the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	For without cause they have 
PSA.35.7	 they have dug without cause for my life.
PSA.35.8	Let 
PSA.35.8	And let his net that he has hidden catch himself;
PSA.35.8	Into that very destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	And my soul shall be joyful in the 
PSA.35.9	It shall rejoice in His salvation.
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say,
PSA.35.10	“
PSA.35.10	Delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him,
PSA.35.10	Yes, the poor and the needy from him who plunders him?”
PSA.35.11	Fierce witnesses rise up;
PSA.35.11	They ask me 
PSA.35.12	They reward me evil for good,
PSA.35.12	 the sorrow of my soul.
PSA.35.13	But as for me, 
PSA.35.13	My clothing 
PSA.35.13	I humbled myself with fasting;
PSA.35.13	And my prayer would return to my own heart.
PSA.35.14	I paced about as though 
PSA.35.14	I bowed down heavily, as one who mourns 
PSA.35.15	But in my adversity they rejoiced
PSA.35.15	And gathered together;
PSA.35.15	Attackers gathered against me,
PSA.35.15	And I did not know 
PSA.35.15	They tore 
PSA.35.16	With ungodly mockers at feasts
PSA.35.16	They gnashed at me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long will You 
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from their destructions,
PSA.35.17	My precious 
PSA.35.18	I will give You thanks in the great assembly;
PSA.35.18	I will praise You among many people.
PSA.35.19	Let them not rejoice over me who are wrongfully my enemies;
PSA.35.19	Nor let them wink with the eye who hate me without a cause.
PSA.35.20	For they do not speak peace,
PSA.35.20	But they devise deceitful matters
PSA.35.20	Against 
PSA.35.21	They also opened their mouth wide against me,
PSA.35.21	 said, “Aha, aha!
PSA.35.21	Our eyes have seen 
PSA.35.22	 You have seen, O 
PSA.35.22	Do not keep silence.
PSA.35.22	O Lord, do not be far from me.
PSA.35.23	Stir up Yourself, and awake to my vindication,
PSA.35.23	To my cause, my God and my Lord.
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me, O 
PSA.35.24	And let them not rejoice over me.
PSA.35.25	Let them not say in their hearts, “Ah, so we would have it!”
PSA.35.25	Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”
PSA.35.26	Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion
PSA.35.26	Who rejoice at my hurt;
PSA.35.26	Let them be 
PSA.35.26	Who exalt themselves against me.
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy and be glad,
PSA.35.27	Who favor my righteous cause;
PSA.35.27	And let them say continually,
PSA.35.27	“Let the 
PSA.35.27	Who has pleasure in the prosperity of His servant.”
PSA.35.28	And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness
PSA.35.28	 of Your praise all the day long.
PSA.36.1	An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked:
PSA.36.2	For he flatters himself in his own eyes,
PSA.36.2	When he finds out his iniquity 
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth 
PSA.36.3	He has ceased to be wise 
PSA.36.4	He devises wickedness on his bed;
PSA.36.4	He sets himself 
PSA.36.4	He does not abhor 
PSA.36.5	Your mercy, O 
PSA.36.5	Your faithfulness 
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness 
PSA.36.6	Your judgments 
PSA.36.6	O 
PSA.36.7	How precious 
PSA.36.7	Therefore the children of men 
PSA.36.8	They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house,
PSA.36.8	And You give them drink from 
PSA.36.9	For with You 
PSA.36.9	In Your light we see light.
PSA.36.10	Oh, continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You,
PSA.36.10	And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of pride come against me,
PSA.36.11	And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There the workers of iniquity have fallen;
PSA.36.12	They have been cast down and are not able to rise.
PSA.37.1	Do
PSA.37.1	Nor be envious of the workers of iniquity.
PSA.37.2	For they shall soon be cut down 
PSA.37.2	And wither as the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness.
PSA.37.4	Delight yourself also in the 
PSA.37.4	And He shall give you the desires of your 
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the 
PSA.37.5	Trust also in Him,
PSA.37.5	And He shall bring 
PSA.37.6	He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light,
PSA.37.6	And your justice as the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Rest in the 
PSA.37.7	Do not fret because of him who 
PSA.37.7	Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass.
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath;
PSA.37.8	Do not fret—
PSA.37.9	For evildoers shall be cut off;
PSA.37.9	But those who wait on the 
PSA.37.9	They shall 
PSA.37.10	For 
PSA.37.10	Indeed, 
PSA.37.10	But it 
PSA.37.11	But the meek shall inherit the earth,
PSA.37.11	And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the just,
PSA.37.12	And gnashes at him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord laughs at him,
PSA.37.13	For He sees that 
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn the sword
PSA.37.14	And have bent their bow,
PSA.37.14	To cast down the poor and needy,
PSA.37.14	To slay those who are of upright conduct.
PSA.37.15	Their sword shall enter their own heart,
PSA.37.15	And their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	A little that a righteous man has
PSA.37.16	 better than the riches of many wicked.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
PSA.37.17	But the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	And their inheritance shall be forever.
PSA.37.19	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time,
PSA.37.19	And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked shall perish;
PSA.37.20	And the enemies of the 
PSA.37.20	Like the splendor of the meadows, shall vanish.
PSA.37.20	Into smoke they shall vanish away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows and does not repay,
PSA.37.21	But 
PSA.37.22	For 
PSA.37.22	But 
PSA.37.23	The steps of a 
PSA.37.23	And He delights in his way.
PSA.37.24	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;
PSA.37.24	For the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and 
PSA.37.25	Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,
PSA.37.25	Nor his descendants begging bread.
PSA.37.26	And his descendants 
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.37.27	And dwell forevermore.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	And does not forsake His saints;
PSA.37.28	They are preserved forever,
PSA.37.28	But the descendants of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall inherit the land,
PSA.37.29	And dwell in it forever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom,
PSA.37.30	And his tongue talks of justice.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God 
PSA.37.31	None of his steps shall slide.
PSA.37.32	The wicked 
PSA.37.32	And seeks to slay him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.33	Nor condemn him when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait on the 
PSA.37.34	And keep His way,
PSA.37.34	And He shall exalt you to inherit the land;
PSA.37.34	When the wicked are cut off, you shall see 
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked in great power,
PSA.37.35	And spreading himself like a native green tree.
PSA.37.36	Yet he passed away, and behold, he 
PSA.37.36	Indeed I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the blameless 
PSA.37.37	For the future of 
PSA.37.38	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together;
PSA.37.38	The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous 
PSA.37.40	And 
PSA.37.40	He shall deliver them from the wicked,
PSA.37.40	And save them,
PSA.37.40	Because they trust in Him.
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.1	Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure!
PSA.38.2	For Your arrows pierce me deeply,
PSA.38.2	And Your hand presses me down.
PSA.38.3	Because of Your anger,
PSA.38.3	Nor 
PSA.38.3	Because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities have gone over my head;
PSA.38.4	Like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds are foul 
PSA.38.5	Because of my foolishness.
PSA.38.6	I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly;
PSA.38.6	I go mourning all the day long.
PSA.38.7	For my loins are full of inflammation,
PSA.38.7	And 
PSA.38.8	I am feeble and severely broken;
PSA.38.8	I groan because of the turmoil of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire 
PSA.38.9	And my sighing is not hidden from You.
PSA.38.10	My heart pants, my strength fails me;
PSA.38.10	As for the light of my eyes, it also has gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My loved ones and my friends 
PSA.38.11	And my relatives stand afar off.
PSA.38.12	Those also who seek my life lay snares 
PSA.38.12	Those who seek my hurt speak of destruction,
PSA.38.12	And plan deception all the day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, like a deaf 
PSA.38.13	And 
PSA.38.14	Thus I am like a man who does not hear,
PSA.38.14	And in whose mouth 
PSA.38.15	For in You, O 
PSA.38.15	You will hear, O Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, 
PSA.38.16	Lest, when my foot slips, they exalt 
PSA.38.17	For I 
PSA.38.17	And my sorrow 
PSA.38.18	For I will 
PSA.38.18	I will be 
PSA.38.19	But my enemies 
PSA.38.19	And those who hate me wrongfully have multiplied.
PSA.38.20	Those also 
PSA.38.20	They are my adversaries, because I follow 
PSA.38.21	Do not forsake me, O 
PSA.38.21	O my God, 
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord, my salvation!
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will guard my ways,
PSA.39.1	Lest I sin with my 
PSA.39.1	I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle,
PSA.39.1	While the wicked are before me.”
PSA.39.2	I was mute with silence,
PSA.39.2	I held my peace 
PSA.39.2	And my sorrow was stirred up.
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me;
PSA.39.3	While I was musing, the fire burned.
PSA.39.3	 I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	“
PSA.39.4	And what 
PSA.39.4	 I may know how frail I 
PSA.39.5	Indeed, You have made my days 
PSA.39.5	And my age 
PSA.39.5	Certainly every man at his best state 
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walks about like a shadow;
PSA.39.6	Surely they busy themselves in vain;
PSA.39.6	He heaps up 
PSA.39.6	And does not know who will gather them.
PSA.39.7	“And now, Lord, what do I wait for?
PSA.39.7	My 
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions;
PSA.39.8	Do not make me 
PSA.39.9	I was mute, I did not open my mouth,
PSA.39.9	Because it was 
PSA.39.10	Remove Your plague from me;
PSA.39.10	I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.
PSA.39.11	When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity,
PSA.39.11	You make his beauty 
PSA.39.11	Surely every man 
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.12	And give ear to my cry;
PSA.39.12	Do not be silent at my tears;
PSA.39.12	For I 
PSA.39.12	A sojourner, 
PSA.39.13	Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength,
PSA.39.13	Before I go away and 
PSA.40.1	I

PSA.40.1	And heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He also brought me up out of a horrible pit,
PSA.40.2	Out of 
PSA.40.2	And 
PSA.40.2	 established my steps.
PSA.40.3	He has put a new song in my mouth—
PSA.40.3	Praise to our God;
PSA.40.3	Many will see 
PSA.40.3	And will trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Blessed 
PSA.40.4	And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
PSA.40.5	Many, O 
PSA.40.5	 You have done;
PSA.40.5	And Your thoughts toward us
PSA.40.5	Cannot be recounted to You in order;
PSA.40.5	 I would declare and speak 
PSA.40.5	They are more than can be numbered.
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and offering You did not desire;
PSA.40.6	My ears You have opened.
PSA.40.6	Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Behold, I come;
PSA.40.7	In the scroll of the book 
PSA.40.8	I delight to do Your will, O my God,
PSA.40.8	And Your law 
PSA.40.9	I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness
PSA.40.9	In the great assembly;
PSA.40.9	Indeed, 
PSA.40.9	O 
PSA.40.10	I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart;
PSA.40.10	I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation;
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth
PSA.40.10	From the great assembly.
PSA.40.11	Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O 
PSA.40.11	Let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually preserve me.
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have surrounded me;
PSA.40.12	My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;
PSA.40.12	They are more than the hairs of my head;
PSA.40.12	Therefore my heart fails me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O 
PSA.40.13	O 
PSA.40.14	Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion
PSA.40.14	Who seek to destroy my life;
PSA.40.14	Let them be driven backward and brought to dishonor
PSA.40.14	Who wish me evil.
PSA.40.15	Let them be 
PSA.40.15	Who say to me, “Aha, aha!”

PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	You will sustain him on his sickbed.
PSA.41.4	I said, “
PSA.41.4	Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies speak evil of me:
PSA.41.5	“When will he die, and his name perish?”
PSA.41.6	And if he comes to see 
PSA.41.6	His heart gathers iniquity to itself;

PSA.41.10	That I may repay them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that You are well pleased with me,

PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God, for the 
PSA.42.2	When shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night,

PSA.42.10	While they say to me all day long,
PSA.42.10	“Where 
PSA.42.11	Why are you cast down, O my soul?
PSA.42.11	And why are you disquieted within me?
PSA.42.11	Hope in God;
PSA.42.11	For I shall yet praise Him,
PSA.42.11	The help of my countenance and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate 
PSA.43.1	And 
PSA.43.1	Oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
PSA.43.2	For You 
PSA.43.2	Why do You cast me off?
PSA.43.2	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	Oh, send out Your light and Your truth!
PSA.43.3	Let them lead me;
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me to 
PSA.43.3	And to Your tabernacle.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	To God my exceeding joy;
PSA.43.4	And on the harp I will praise You,
PSA.43.4	O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why are you cast down, O my soul?
PSA.43.5	And why are you disquieted within me?
PSA.43.5	Hope in God;
PSA.43.5	For I shall yet praise Him,
PSA.43.5	The help of my countenance and my God.
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God,
PSA.44.1	Our fathers have told us,
PSA.44.1	The deeds You did in their days,
PSA.44.1	In days of old:
PSA.44.2	You drove out the nations with Your hand,
PSA.44.2	But them You planted;
PSA.44.2	You afflicted the peoples, and cast them out.
PSA.44.3	For 
PSA.44.3	Nor did their own arm save them;
PSA.44.3	But it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your countenance,
PSA.44.3	Because You favored them.
PSA.44.4	You are my King, O God;
PSA.44.4	Command victories for Jacob.
PSA.44.5	Through You 
PSA.44.5	Through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For 
PSA.44.6	Nor shall my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But You have saved us from our enemies,
PSA.44.7	And have put to shame those who hated us.
PSA.44.8	In God we boast all day long,
PSA.44.8	And praise Your name forever.
PSA.44.9	But 
PSA.44.9	And You do not go out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You make us 
PSA.44.10	And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.
PSA.44.11	You have given us up like sheep 
PSA.44.11	And have 
PSA.44.12	You sell Your people for 
PSA.44.12	And are not enriched by selling them.
PSA.44.13	You make us a reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.44.13	A scorn and a derision to those all around us.
PSA.44.14	You make us a byword among the nations,
PSA.44.14	A shaking of the head among the peoples.
PSA.44.15	My dishonor 
PSA.44.15	And the shame of my face has covered me,
PSA.44.16	Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles,
PSA.44.16	Because of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this has come upon us;
PSA.44.17	But we have not forgotten You,
PSA.44.17	Nor have we dealt falsely with Your covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart has not turned back,
PSA.44.18	Nor have our steps departed from Your way;
PSA.44.19	But You have severely broken us in 
PSA.44.19	And covered us 
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God,
PSA.44.20	Or 
PSA.44.21	Would not God search this out?
PSA.44.21	For He knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	Yet for Your sake we are killed all day long;
PSA.44.22	We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Arise! Do not cast 
PSA.44.24	Why do You hide Your face,
PSA.44.24	 forget our affliction and our oppression?
PSA.44.25	For 
PSA.44.25	Our body clings to the ground.
PSA.44.26	Arise for our help,
PSA.44.26	And redeem us for Your mercies’ sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart is overflowing with a good theme;
PSA.45.1	I recite my composition concerning the King;
PSA.45.1	My tongue 
PSA.45.2	You are fairer than the sons of men;
PSA.45.2	Grace is poured upon Your lips;
PSA.45.2	Therefore God has blessed You forever.
PSA.45.3	Gird Your 
PSA.45.3	With Your 
PSA.45.4	And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, 
PSA.45.4	And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things.

PSA.45.8	All Your garments 
PSA.45.8	Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters 
PSA.45.9	At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Listen, O daughter,
PSA.45.10	Consider and incline your ear;
PSA.45.10	Forget your own people also, and your father’s house;
PSA.45.11	So the King will greatly desire your beauty;
PSA.45.11	Because He 
PSA.45.12	And the daughter of Tyre 
PSA.45.12	The rich among the people will seek your favor.
PSA.45.13	The royal daughter 
PSA.45.13	Her clothing 
PSA.45.14	She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors;
PSA.45.14	The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to You.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought;
PSA.45.15	They shall enter the King’s palace.
PSA.45.16	Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons,
PSA.45.16	Whom You shall make princes in all the earth.

PSA.46.9	He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two;
PSA.46.9	He burns the chariot in the fire.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I 
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the nations,

PSA.48.11	Let Mount Zion rejoice,
PSA.48.11	Let the daughters of Judah be glad,
PSA.48.11	Because of Your judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion,
PSA.48.12	And go all around her.
PSA.48.12	Count her towers;
PSA.48.13	Mark well her bulwarks;
PSA.48.13	Consider her palaces;
PSA.48.13	That you may

PSA.48.14	Our God forever and ever;
PSA.48.14	He will be our guide
PSA.48.14	 to death.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all peoples;
PSA.49.1	Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
PSA.49.2	Both low and high,
PSA.49.2	Rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak wisdom,
PSA.49.3	And the meditation of my heart 
PSA.49.4	I will incline my ear to a proverb;
PSA.49.4	I will disclose my dark saying on the harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in the days of evil,
PSA.49.5	 the iniquity at my heels surrounds me?

PSA.49.14	Death shall feed on them;
PSA.49.14	The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
PSA.49.14	And their beauty shall be consumed in the grave, far from their dwelling.
PSA.49.15	But God 
PSA.49.15	For He shall 
PSA.49.16	Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,
PSA.49.16	When the glory of his house is increased;

PSA.50.15	Call upon Me in the day of trouble;

PSA.50.20	You slander your own mother’s son.

PSA.50.22	“Now consider this, you who

PSA.50.22	And 
PSA.50.23	Whoever offers praise glorifies Me;

PSA.50.23	I will show the salvation of God.”
PSA.51.1	Have mercy upon me, O God,
PSA.51.1	According to Your lovingkindness;

PSA.51.4	Against You, You only, have I sinned,
PSA.51.4	And done 
PSA.51.4	That You may be found just when You speak,
PSA.51.4	 blameless when You judge.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,

PSA.52.1	Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man?
PSA.52.1	The goodness of God 
PSA.52.2	Your tongue devises destruction,
PSA.52.2	Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good,
PSA.52.3	Lying rather than speaking righteousness.
PSA.52.4	You love all devouring words,
PSA.52.4	 deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	God shall likewise destroy you forever;
PSA.52.5	He shall take you away, and pluck you out of 
PSA.52.5	And uproot you from the land of the living.
PSA.52.6	The righteous also shall see and fear,
PSA.52.6	And shall laugh at him, 
PSA.52.7	“Here is the man 
PSA.52.7	But trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.7	 strengthened himself in his wickedness.”

PSA.52.8	I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will praise You forever,

PSA.53.3	No, not one.
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity 
PSA.53.4	Who eat up my people 
PSA.53.4	And do not call upon God?
PSA.53.5	There they are in great fear
PSA.53.5	 no fear was,

PSA.53.6	When God brings back the captivity of His people,
PSA.53.6	Let Jacob rejoice 
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by Your name,
PSA.54.1	And vindicate me by Your strength.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	Give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers have risen up against me,
PSA.54.3	And oppressors have sought after my life;
PSA.54.3	They have not set God before them.
PSA.54.4	Behold, God 
PSA.54.4	The Lord 
PSA.54.5	He will repay my enemies for their evil.
PSA.54.5	Cut them off in Your truth.
PSA.54.6	I will freely sacrifice to You;

PSA.54.7	For He has delivered me out of all trouble;
PSA.54.7	And my eye has seen

PSA.55.1	And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Attend to me, and hear me;
PSA.55.2	I

PSA.55.4	My heart is severely pained within me,
PSA.55.4	And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me,
PSA.55.5	And horror has overwhelmed me.

PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast;
PSA.57.7	I will sing and give praise.
PSA.57.8	Awake, 
PSA.57.8	Awake, lute and harp!
PSA.57.8	I will awaken the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples;

PSA.58.2	No, in heart you work wickedness;
PSA.58.2	You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb;

PSA.58.4	Their poison 
PSA.58.5	Which will not

PSA.58.11	So that men will say,
PSA.58.11	“Surely

PSA.59.5	You therefore, O 
PSA.59.5	Awake to punish all the nations;
PSA.59.5	Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors.
PSA.59.6	At evening they return,
PSA.59.6	They growl like a dog,

PSA.59.11	Do not slay them, lest my people forget;

PSA.59.11	And bring them down,
PSA.59.11	O Lord our shield.

PSA.59.14	And 
PSA.59.14	They growl like a dog,
PSA.59.14	And go all around the city.
PSA.59.15	They 
PSA.59.15	And howl if they are not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of Your power;
PSA.59.16	Yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning;
PSA.59.16	For You have been my defense
PSA.59.16	And refuge in the day of my trouble.

PSA.60.1	O God, 
PSA.60.1	You have broken us down;
PSA.60.1	You have been displeased;
PSA.60.1	Oh, restore us again!
PSA.60.2	You have made the earth tremble;
PSA.60.2	You have broken it;
PSA.60.2	Heal its breaches, for it is shaking.
PSA.60.3	You have shown Your people hard things;
PSA.60.3	You have made us drink the wine of confusion.
PSA.60.4	You have given a banner to those who fear You,
PSA.60.4	That it may be displayed because of the truth.
PSA.60.5	That Your beloved may be delivered,
PSA.60.5	Save 
PSA.60.6	God has 
PSA.60.6	“I will rejoice;
PSA.60.6	I will 
PSA.60.6	And measure out

PSA.60.8	Moab 
PSA.60.8	Over Edom I will cast My shoe;
PSA.60.8	Philistia, shout in triumph because of Me.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me 
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	And You, O God, 
PSA.60.11	Give us help from trouble,
PSA.60.11	For the help of man 
PSA.60.12	Through God 
PSA.60.12	For 
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	Attend to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth I will cry to You,
PSA.61.2	When my heart is overwhelmed;
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For You have been a shelter for me,
PSA.61.3	A strong tower from the enemy.
PSA.61.4	I will abide in Your tabernacle forever;
PSA.61.4	I will trust in the shelter of Your wings.
PSA.61.5	For You, O God, have heard my vows;
PSA.61.5	You have given 
PSA.61.6	You will prolong the king’s life,
PSA.61.6	His years as many generations.
PSA.61.7	He shall abide before God forever.
PSA.61.7	Oh, prepare mercy 
PSA.61.8	So I will sing praise to Your name forever,
PSA.61.8	That I may daily perform my vows.
PSA.62.1	Truly 
PSA.62.1	From Him 
PSA.62.2	He only 
PSA.62.2	I shall not be greatly 
PSA.62.3	How long will you attack a man?
PSA.62.3	You shall be slain, all of you,
PSA.62.3	Like a leaning wall and a tottering fence.
PSA.62.4	They only consult to cast 
PSA.62.4	They 
PSA.62.4	They bless with their mouth,
PSA.62.4	But they curse inwardly.
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait silently for God alone,
PSA.62.5	For my expectation 
PSA.62.6	He only 
PSA.62.6	I shall not be moved.
PSA.62.7	In God 
PSA.62.7	The rock of my strength,
PSA.62.7	 my refuge, 
PSA.62.8	Trust in Him at all times, you people;
PSA.62.8	Pour out your heart before Him;
PSA.62.8	God 
PSA.62.9	Surely men of low degree 
PSA.62.9	Men of high degree 
PSA.62.9	If they are weighed on the scales,
PSA.62.9	They 
PSA.62.10	Do not trust in oppression,
PSA.62.10	Nor vainly hope in robbery;
PSA.62.10	If riches increase,
PSA.62.10	Do not set 
PSA.62.11	God has spoken once,
PSA.62.11	Twice I have heard this:
PSA.62.11	That power 
PSA.62.12	Also to You, O Lord, 
PSA.62.12	For 
PSA.63.1	O God, You 
PSA.63.1	Early will I seek You;
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsts for You;
PSA.63.1	My flesh longs for You
PSA.63.1	In a dry and thirsty land
PSA.63.1	Where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	So I have looked for You in the sanctuary,
PSA.63.2	To see 
PSA.63.3	Because Your lovingkindness 
PSA.63.3	My lips shall praise You.
PSA.63.4	Thus I will bless You while I live;
PSA.63.4	I will 
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness,
PSA.63.5	And my mouth shall praise 
PSA.63.6	When 
PSA.63.6	I meditate on You in the 
PSA.63.7	Because You have been my help,
PSA.63.7	Therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice.
PSA.63.8	My soul follows close behind You;
PSA.63.8	Your right hand upholds me.
PSA.63.9	But those 
PSA.63.9	Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They shall fall by the sword;
PSA.63.10	They shall be a portion for jackals.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	Everyone who swears by Him shall glory;
PSA.63.11	But the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation;
PSA.64.1	Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,
PSA.64.2	From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity,
PSA.64.3	Who sharpen their tongue like a sword,
PSA.64.3	And bend 
PSA.64.4	That they may shoot in secret at the blameless;
PSA.64.4	Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves 
PSA.64.5	They talk of laying snares secretly;
PSA.64.5	They say, “Who will see them?”
PSA.64.6	They devise iniquities:
PSA.64.6	“We have perfected a shrewd scheme.”
PSA.64.6	Both the inward thought and the heart of man are deep.
PSA.64.7	But God shall shoot at them 
PSA.64.7	Suddenly they shall be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So He will make them stumble over their own tongue;
PSA.64.8	All who see them shall flee away.
PSA.64.9	All men shall fear,
PSA.64.9	And shall 
PSA.64.9	For they shall wisely consider His doing.
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.64.10	And all the upright in heart shall glory.
PSA.65.1	Praise is awaiting You, O God, in Zion;
PSA.65.1	And to You the vow shall be performed.
PSA.65.2	O You who hear prayer,
PSA.65.2	To You all flesh will come.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities prevail against me;
PSA.65.3	You will

PSA.65.4	And cause to approach 
PSA.65.4	 he may dwell in Your courts.
PSA.65.4	We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house,
PSA.65.4	Of Your holy temple.
PSA.65.5	 awesome deeds in righteousness You will answer us,
PSA.65.5	O God of our salvation,
PSA.65.5	And of the far-off seas;
PSA.65.6	Who established the mountains by His strength,
PSA.65.6	 clothed with power;
PSA.65.7	You who still the noise of the seas,
PSA.65.7	The noise of their waves,
PSA.65.7	And the tumult of the peoples.
PSA.65.8	They also who dwell in the farthest parts are afraid of Your signs;
PSA.65.8	You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice.
PSA.65.9	You visit the earth and 
PSA.65.9	You greatly enrich it;
PSA.65.9	The river of God is full of water;
PSA.65.9	You provide their grain,
PSA.65.9	For so You have prepared it.
PSA.65.10	You water its ridges abundantly,
PSA.65.10	You settle its furrows;
PSA.65.10	You make it soft with showers,
PSA.65.10	You bless its growth.
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with Your goodness,
PSA.65.11	And Your paths drip 
PSA.65.12	They drop 
PSA.65.12	And the little hills rejoice on every side.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are clothed with flocks;
PSA.65.13	The valleys also are covered with grain;
PSA.65.13	They shout for joy, they also sing.
PSA.66.1	Make 
PSA.66.2	Sing out the honor of His name;
PSA.66.2	Make His praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say to God,
PSA.66.3	“How 
PSA.66.3	Through the greatness of Your power
PSA.66.3	Your enemies shall submit themselves to You.
PSA.66.4	All the earth shall worship You
PSA.66.4	And sing praises to You;
PSA.66.4	They shall sing praises 
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God;
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry 
PSA.66.6	They went through the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	There we will rejoice in Him.
PSA.66.7	He rules by His power forever;
PSA.66.7	His eyes observe the nations;
PSA.66.7	Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves.
PSA.66.8	Oh, bless our God, you peoples!
PSA.66.8	And make the voice of His praise to be heard,
PSA.66.9	Who keeps our soul among the living,
PSA.66.9	And does not allow our feet to be moved.
PSA.66.10	For 
PSA.66.10	You have refined us as silver is refined.
PSA.66.11	You brought us into the net;
PSA.66.11	You laid affliction on our backs.
PSA.66.12	You have caused men to ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and through water;
PSA.66.12	But You brought us out to rich 
PSA.66.13	I will go into Your house with burnt offerings;
PSA.66.13	I will pay You my vows,
PSA.66.14	Which my lips have uttered
PSA.66.14	And my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer You burnt sacrifices of fat animals,
PSA.66.15	With the sweet aroma of rams;
PSA.66.15	I will offer bulls with goats.
PSA.66.16	Come 
PSA.66.16	And I will declare what He has done for my soul.
PSA.66.17	I cried to Him with my mouth,
PSA.66.17	And He was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard iniquity in my heart,
PSA.66.18	The Lord will not hear.
PSA.66.19	 certainly God 
PSA.66.19	He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed 
PSA.66.20	Who has not turned away my prayer,
PSA.66.20	Nor His mercy from me!

PSA.68.6	God sets the solitary in families;
PSA.68.6	He brings out those who are bound into prosperity;
PSA.68.6	But 
PSA.68.7	O God, 
PSA.68.7	When You marched through the wilderness,
PSA.68.8	The earth shook;
PSA.68.8	The heavens also dropped 
PSA.68.8	Sinai itself 
PSA.68.9	You, O God, sent a plentiful rain,
PSA.68.9	Whereby You confirmed Your inheritance,
PSA.68.9	When it was weary.
PSA.68.10	Your congregation dwelt in it;
PSA.68.10	You, O God, provided from Your goodness for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gave the word;
PSA.68.11	Great 
PSA.68.12	“Kings
PSA.68.12	And she who remains at home divides the spoil.
PSA.68.13	Though you lie down among the sheepfolds,
PSA.68.13	And her feathers with yellow gold.”
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings in it,
PSA.68.14	It was 
PSA.68.15	A mountain of God 
PSA.68.15	A mountain 
PSA.68.16	Why do you fume with envy, you mountains of 
PSA.68.16	Yes, the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God 
PSA.68.17	 thousands of thousands;
PSA.68.17	The Lord is among them 
PSA.68.18	You have ascended on high,
PSA.68.18	You have led captivity captive;
PSA.68.18	You have received gifts among men,
PSA.68.18	Even 
PSA.68.18	That the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed 
PSA.68.19	 daily loads us 
PSA.68.19	The God of our salvation!
PSA.68.20	Our God 
PSA.68.20	And 
PSA.68.21	But 
PSA.68.21	The hairy scalp of the one who still goes on in his trespasses.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring 
PSA.68.22	I will bring 
PSA.68.23	That your foot may crush 
PSA.68.23	And the tongues of your dogs 
PSA.68.24	They have seen Your procession, O God,
PSA.68.24	The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the players on instruments 
PSA.68.25	Among 
PSA.68.26	Bless God in the congregations,
PSA.68.26	The Lord, from 
PSA.68.27	There 
PSA.68.27	The princes of Judah 
PSA.68.27	The princes of Zebulun 
PSA.68.28	Your God has 
PSA.68.28	Strengthen, O God, what You have done for us.
PSA.68.29	Because of Your temple at Jerusalem,
PSA.68.29	Kings will bring presents to You.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beasts of the reeds,
PSA.68.30	The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples,
PSA.68.30	Scatter the peoples 
PSA.68.31	Envoys will come out of Egypt;
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia will quickly 
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, you 
PSA.68.32	Oh, sing praises to the Lord,
PSA.68.33	To Him 
PSA.68.33	Indeed, He sends out His voice, a 
PSA.68.34	Ascribe strength to God;
PSA.68.34	His excellence 
PSA.68.34	And His strength 
PSA.68.35	O God, 
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel 
PSA.68.35	Blessed 
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God!
PSA.69.1	For 
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire,
PSA.69.2	Where 
PSA.69.2	I have come into deep waters,
PSA.69.2	Where the floods overflow me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my crying;
PSA.69.3	My throat is dry;
PSA.69.3	My eyes fail while I wait for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those who 
PSA.69.4	Are more than the hairs of my head;
PSA.69.4	They are mighty who would destroy me,
PSA.69.4	 my enemies wrongfully;
PSA.69.4	Though I have stolen nothing,
PSA.69.4	I 
PSA.69.5	O God, You know my foolishness;
PSA.69.5	And my sins are not hidden from You.
PSA.69.6	Let not those who wait for You, O Lord G
PSA.69.6	Let not those who seek You be confounded because of me, O God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;
PSA.69.7	Shame has covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I have become a stranger to my brothers,
PSA.69.8	And an alien to my mother’s children;
PSA.69.9	Because zeal for Your house has eaten me up,
PSA.69.9	And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept 
PSA.69.10	That became my reproach.
PSA.69.11	I also made sackcloth my garment;
PSA.69.11	I became a byword to them.
PSA.69.12	Those who sit in the gate speak against me,
PSA.69.12	And I 
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer 
PSA.69.13	O 
PSA.69.13	O God, in the multitude of Your mercy,
PSA.69.13	Hear me in the truth of Your salvation.
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire,
PSA.69.14	And let me not sink;
PSA.69.14	Let me be delivered from those who hate me,
PSA.69.14	And out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the floodwater overflow me,
PSA.69.15	Nor let the deep swallow me up;
PSA.69.15	And let not the pit shut its mouth on me.
PSA.69.16	Hear me, O 
PSA.69.16	Turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.
PSA.69.17	And do not hide Your face from Your servant,
PSA.69.17	For I am in trouble;
PSA.69.17	Hear me speedily.
PSA.69.18	Draw near to my soul, 
PSA.69.18	Deliver me because of my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You know 
PSA.69.19	My adversaries 
PSA.69.20	Reproach has broken my heart,
PSA.69.20	And I am full of heaviness;
PSA.69.20	I looked 
PSA.69.20	And for 
PSA.69.21	They also gave me gall for my food,
PSA.69.21	And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their table become a snare before them,
PSA.69.22	And their well-being a trap.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see;
PSA.69.23	And make their loins shake continually.
PSA.69.24	Pour out Your indignation upon them,
PSA.69.24	And let Your wrathful anger take hold of them.
PSA.69.25	Let their dwelling place be desolate;
PSA.69.25	Let no one live in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute the 
PSA.69.26	And talk of the grief of those You have wounded.
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity to their iniquity,
PSA.69.27	And let them not come into Your righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Let them 
PSA.69.28	And not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I 
PSA.69.29	Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song,
PSA.69.30	And will magnify Him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	 also shall please the 
PSA.69.31	Which has horns and hooves.
PSA.69.32	The humble shall see 
PSA.69.32	And you who seek God, 
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	And does not despise 
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise Him,
PSA.69.34	The seas 
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion
PSA.69.35	And build the cities of Judah,
PSA.69.35	That they may dwell there and possess it.
PSA.69.36	Also, 
PSA.69.36	And those who love His name shall dwell in it.
PSA.70.1	Make haste to help me, O 
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and confounded
PSA.70.2	Who seek my life;
PSA.70.2	Let them be turned back and confused
PSA.70.2	Who desire my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back because of their shame,
PSA.70.3	Who say, “Aha, aha!”
PSA.70.4	Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;
PSA.70.4	And let those who love Your salvation say continually,
PSA.70.4	“Let God be magnified!”
PSA.70.5	But I 
PSA.70.5	Make haste to me, O God!
PSA.70.5	You 
PSA.70.5	O 
PSA.71.1	In 
PSA.71.1	Let me never be put to shame.
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in Your righteousness, and cause me to escape;
PSA.71.2	Incline Your ear to me, and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be my strong refuge,
PSA.71.3	To which I may resort continually;
PSA.71.3	You have given the 
PSA.71.3	For You 
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
PSA.71.5	For You are 
PSA.71.6	By You I have been upheld from birth;
PSA.71.6	You are He who took me out of my mother’s womb.
PSA.71.6	My praise 
PSA.71.7	I have become as a wonder to many,
PSA.71.7	But You 
PSA.71.8	Let 
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
PSA.71.9	Do not forsake me when my strength fails.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies speak against me;
PSA.71.10	And those who lie in wait for my life 
PSA.71.11	Saying, “God has forsaken him;
PSA.71.11	Pursue and take him, for 
PSA.71.12	O God, do not be far from me;

PSA.71.13	Who are adversaries of my life;
PSA.71.13	Let them be covered 
PSA.71.13	Who seek my hurt.
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually,
PSA.71.14	And will praise You yet more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness
PSA.71.15	 Your salvation all the day,
PSA.71.15	For I do not know 
PSA.71.16	I will go in the strength of the Lord G
PSA.71.16	I will make mention of Your righteousness, of Yours only.

PSA.71.24	Who seek my hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king Your judgments, O God,
PSA.72.1	And Your righteousness to the king’s Son.
PSA.72.2	He will judge Your people with righteousness,
PSA.72.2	And Your poor with justice.
PSA.72.3	The mountains will bring peace to the people,
PSA.72.3	And the little hills, by righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He will bring justice to the poor of the people;
PSA.72.4	He will save the children of the needy,
PSA.72.4	And will break in pieces the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear You
PSA.72.5	As long as the sun and moon endure,
PSA.72.5	Throughout all generations.

PSA.72.6	Like showers 
PSA.72.7	In His days the righteous shall flourish,
PSA.72.7	And abundance of peace,
PSA.72.7	Until the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
PSA.72.8	And from the River to the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before Him,
PSA.72.9	And His enemies will lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
PSA.72.10	Will bring presents;

PSA.72.10	Will offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him;
PSA.72.11	All nations shall serve Him.
PSA.72.12	For He 
PSA.72.12	The poor also, and 
PSA.72.13	He will spare the poor and needy,
PSA.72.13	And will save the souls of the needy.
PSA.72.14	He will redeem their life from oppression and violence;
PSA.72.14	And 
PSA.72.15	And He shall live;
PSA.72.15	And the gold of 
PSA.72.15	Prayer also will be made for Him continually,

PSA.72.16	There will be an abundance of grain in the earth,
PSA.72.16	On the top of the mountains;
PSA.72.16	Its fruit shall wave like Lebanon;

PSA.72.17	His name shall endure forever;
PSA.72.17	His name shall continue as long as the sun.
PSA.72.17	And 
PSA.72.17	All nations shall call Him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed

PSA.72.19	And let the whole earth be filled 
PSA.72.19	Amen and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Truly God 
PSA.73.1	To such as are pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;
PSA.73.2	My steps had nearly 
PSA.73.3	For I 
PSA.73.3	When I saw the prosperity of the 
PSA.73.4	For 
PSA.73.4	But their strength 
PSA.73.5	They 
PSA.73.5	Nor are they plagued like 
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride serves as their necklace;
PSA.73.6	Violence covers them 
PSA.73.7	Their eyes bulge with abundance;
PSA.73.7	They have more than heart could wish.
PSA.73.8	They scoff and speak wickedly 
PSA.73.8	They 
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth 
PSA.73.9	And their tongue walks through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return here,
PSA.73.10	And waters of a full 
PSA.73.11	And they say, 
PSA.73.11	And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
PSA.73.12	Behold, these 
PSA.73.12	Who are always at ease;
PSA.73.12	They increase 
PSA.73.13	Surely I have cleansed my heart 
PSA.73.13	And washed my hands in innocence.
PSA.73.14	For all day long I have been plagued,
PSA.73.14	And chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
PSA.73.15	Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children.
PSA.73.16	When I thought 
PSA.73.16	It 
PSA.73.17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
PSA.73.17	 I understood their 
PSA.73.18	Surely 
PSA.73.18	You cast them down to destruction.
PSA.73.19	Oh, how they are 
PSA.73.19	They are utterly consumed with terrors.
PSA.73.20	As a dream when 
PSA.73.20	 Lord, when You awake,
PSA.73.20	You shall despise their image.
PSA.73.21	Thus my heart was grieved,
PSA.73.21	And I was vexed in my mind.
PSA.73.22	I 
PSA.73.22	I was 
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I 
PSA.73.23	You hold 
PSA.73.24	You will guide me with Your counsel,
PSA.73.24	And afterward receive me 
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven 
PSA.73.25	And 
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart fail;
PSA.73.26	 God 
PSA.73.27	For indeed, 
PSA.73.27	You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.
PSA.73.28	But 
PSA.73.28	I have put my trust in the Lord G
PSA.73.28	That I may 
PSA.74.1	O God, why have You cast 
PSA.74.1	 does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember Your congregation, 
PSA.74.2	The tribe of Your inheritance, 
PSA.74.2	This Mount Zion where You have dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations.
PSA.74.3	The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place;
PSA.74.4	They set up their banners 
PSA.74.5	They seem like men who lift up
PSA.74.5	Axes among the thick trees.
PSA.74.6	And now they break down its carved work, all at once,
PSA.74.6	With axes and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have set fire to Your sanctuary;
PSA.74.7	They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts,
PSA.74.8	“Let us destroy them altogether.”
PSA.74.8	They have burned up all the meeting places of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We do not see our signs;
PSA.74.9	Nor 
PSA.74.10	O God, how long will the adversary reproach?
PSA.74.10	Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand?
PSA.74.12	For 
PSA.74.12	Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	You divided the sea by Your strength;
PSA.74.13	You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.
PSA.74.14	You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces,
PSA.74.14	 gave him 
PSA.74.15	You broke open the fountain and the flood;
PSA.74.15	You dried up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day 
PSA.74.16	You have prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	You have 
PSA.74.17	You have made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, 
PSA.74.18	And 
PSA.74.19	Oh, do not deliver the life of Your turtledove to the wild beast!
PSA.74.19	Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.
PSA.74.20	Have respect to the covenant;
PSA.74.20	For the dark places of the earth are full of the haunts of cruelty.
PSA.74.21	Oh, do not let the oppressed return ashamed!
PSA.74.21	Let the poor and needy praise Your name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead Your own cause;
PSA.74.22	Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the voice of Your enemies;
PSA.74.23	The tumult of those who rise up against You increases continually.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks!
PSA.75.1	For Your wondrous works declare 
PSA.75.2	“When I choose the proper time,
PSA.75.2	I will judge uprightly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved;
PSA.75.3	I set up its pillars firmly.
PSA.75.4	“I said to the boastful, ‘Do not deal boastfully,’
PSA.75.4	And to the wicked, 
PSA.75.5	Do not lift up your horn on high;
PSA.75.5	Do 
PSA.75.6	For exaltation 
PSA.75.6	Nor from the west nor from the south.
PSA.75.7	But 
PSA.75.7	He puts down one,
PSA.75.7	And exalts another.
PSA.75.8	For 
PSA.75.8	And the wine is red;
PSA.75.8	It is fully mixed, and He pours it out;
PSA.75.8	Surely its dregs shall all the wicked of the earth
PSA.75.8	Drain 
PSA.75.9	But I will declare forever,
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	“All
PSA.76.1	In 
PSA.76.1	His name 
PSA.76.2	In Salem also is His tabernacle,
PSA.76.2	And His dwelling place in Zion.

PSA.76.4	 the mountains of prey.
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted were plundered;
PSA.76.5	They have sunk into their sleep;
PSA.76.5	And none of the mighty men have found the use of their hands.
PSA.76.6	At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	Both the chariot and horse were cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	You, Yourself, 
PSA.76.7	And 
PSA.76.7	When once You are angry?
PSA.76.8	You caused judgment to be heard from heaven;
PSA.76.8	The earth feared and was still,
PSA.76.9	When God 
PSA.76.9	To deliver all the oppressed of the earth.
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise You;
PSA.76.10	With the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself.
PSA.76.11	Make vows to the 
PSA.76.11	Let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who ought to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes;
PSA.77.1	I cried out to God with my voice—
PSA.77.1	To God with my voice;
PSA.77.1	And He gave ear to me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;
PSA.77.2	My hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing;
PSA.77.2	My soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remembered God, and was troubled;
PSA.77.3	I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.
PSA.77.4	You hold my eyelids 
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old,
PSA.77.5	The years of ancient times.
PSA.77.6	I call to remembrance my song in the night;
PSA.77.6	I meditate within my heart,
PSA.77.6	And my spirit makes diligent search.
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord cast off forever?
PSA.77.7	And will He be favorable no more?
PSA.77.8	Has His mercy ceased forever?
PSA.77.8	Has 
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies?
PSA.77.10	And I said, “This 
PSA.77.11	I will remember the works of the 
PSA.77.11	Surely I will remember Your wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will also meditate on all Your work,
PSA.77.12	And talk of Your deeds.
PSA.77.13	Your way, O God, 
PSA.77.13	Who 
PSA.77.14	You 
PSA.77.14	You have declared Your strength among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	You have with 
PSA.77.15	The sons of Jacob and Joseph.
PSA.77.16	The waters saw You, O God;
PSA.77.16	The waters saw You, they were 
PSA.77.16	The depths also trembled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water;
PSA.77.17	The skies sent out a sound;
PSA.77.17	Your arrows also flashed about.
PSA.77.18	The voice of Your thunder 
PSA.77.18	The lightnings lit up the world;
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Your way 
PSA.77.19	Your path in the great waters,
PSA.77.19	And Your footsteps were not known.
PSA.77.20	You led Your people like a flock
PSA.77.20	By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, 
PSA.78.1	Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a 
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark sayings of old,
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	And our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide 
PSA.78.4	Telling to the generation to come the praises of the 
PSA.78.4	And His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.
PSA.78.5	For 
PSA.78.5	And appointed a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	Which He commanded our fathers,
PSA.78.5	That 
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know 
PSA.78.6	The children 
PSA.78.6	 they may arise and declare 
PSA.78.7	That they may set their hope in God,
PSA.78.7	And not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	But keep His commandments;
PSA.78.8	And 
PSA.78.8	A stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	A generation 
PSA.78.8	And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	The children of Ephraim, 
PSA.78.9	Turned back in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They did not keep the covenant of God;
PSA.78.10	They refused to walk in His law,
PSA.78.11	And 
PSA.78.11	And His wonders that He had shown them.
PSA.78.12	Marvelous things He did in the sight of their fathers,
PSA.78.12	In the land of Egypt, 
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea and caused them to pass through;
PSA.78.13	And 
PSA.78.14	In the daytime also He led them with the cloud,
PSA.78.14	And all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He split the rocks in the wilderness,
PSA.78.15	And gave 
PSA.78.16	He also brought 
PSA.78.16	And caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	But they sinned even more against Him
PSA.78.17	By 
PSA.78.18	And 
PSA.78.18	By asking for the food of their fancy.
PSA.78.19	Yes, they spoke against God:
PSA.78.19	They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, He struck the rock,
PSA.78.20	So that the waters gushed out,
PSA.78.20	And the streams overflowed.
PSA.78.20	Can He give bread also?
PSA.78.20	Can He provide meat for His people?”
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.21	So a fire was kindled against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	And anger also came up against Israel,
PSA.78.22	Because they 
PSA.78.22	And did not trust in His salvation.
PSA.78.23	Yet He had commanded the clouds above,
PSA.78.23	And opened the doors of heaven,
PSA.78.24	Had rained down manna on them to eat,
PSA.78.24	And given them of the bread of 
PSA.78.25	Men ate angels’ food;
PSA.78.25	He sent them food to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens;
PSA.78.26	And by His power He brought in the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He also rained meat on them like the dust,
PSA.78.27	Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas;
PSA.78.28	And He let 
PSA.78.28	All around their dwellings.
PSA.78.29	So they ate and were well filled,
PSA.78.29	For He gave them their own desire.
PSA.78.30	They were not deprived of their craving;
PSA.78.30	But 
PSA.78.31	The wrath of God came against them,
PSA.78.31	And slew the stoutest of them,
PSA.78.31	And struck down the choice 
PSA.78.32	In spite of this 
PSA.78.32	And 
PSA.78.33	Therefore their days He consumed in futility,
PSA.78.33	And their years in fear.
PSA.78.34	When He slew them, then they sought Him;
PSA.78.34	And they returned and sought earnestly for God.
PSA.78.35	Then they remembered that 
PSA.78.35	And the Most High God 
PSA.78.36	Nevertheless they 
PSA.78.36	And they lied to Him with their tongue;
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not steadfast with Him,
PSA.78.37	Nor were they faithful in His covenant.
PSA.78.38	But He, 
PSA.78.38	And did not destroy 
PSA.78.38	Yes, many a time 
PSA.78.38	And 
PSA.78.39	For 
PSA.78.39	A breath that passes away and does not come again.
PSA.78.40	How often they 
PSA.78.40	 grieved Him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	Yes, 
PSA.78.41	And limited the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember His power:
PSA.78.42	The day when He redeemed them from the enemy,
PSA.78.43	When He worked His signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	And His wonders in the field of Zoan;
PSA.78.44	Turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	And their streams, that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them,
PSA.78.45	And 
PSA.78.46	He also gave their crops to the caterpillar,
PSA.78.46	And their labor to the 
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail,
PSA.78.47	And their sycamore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He also gave up their 
PSA.78.48	And their flocks to fiery lightning.
PSA.78.49	He cast on them the fierceness of His anger,
PSA.78.49	Wrath, indignation, and trouble,
PSA.78.49	By sending angels of destruction 
PSA.78.50	He made a path for His anger;
PSA.78.50	He did not spare their soul from death,
PSA.78.50	But gave their life over to the plague,
PSA.78.51	And destroyed all the 
PSA.78.51	The first of 
PSA.78.52	But He 
PSA.78.52	And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
PSA.78.53	And He 
PSA.78.53	But the sea 
PSA.78.54	And He brought them to His 
PSA.78.54	This mountain 
PSA.78.55	He also drove out the nations before them,
PSA.78.55	Allotted them an inheritance by survey,
PSA.78.55	And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
PSA.78.56	Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God,
PSA.78.56	And did not keep His testimonies,
PSA.78.57	But 
PSA.78.57	They were turned aside 
PSA.78.58	For they provoked Him to anger with their 
PSA.78.58	And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard 
PSA.78.59	And greatly abhorred Israel,
PSA.78.60	So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	The tent He had placed among men,
PSA.78.61	And delivered His strength into captivity,
PSA.78.61	And His glory into the enemy’s hand.
PSA.78.62	He also gave His people over to the sword,
PSA.78.62	And was furious with His inheritance.
PSA.78.63	The fire consumed their young men,
PSA.78.63	And 
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	And 
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awoke as 
PSA.78.65	Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
PSA.78.66	And 
PSA.78.66	He put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA.78.67	Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion 
PSA.78.69	And He built His 
PSA.78.69	Like the earth which He has established forever.
PSA.78.70	He also chose David His servant,
PSA.78.70	And took him from the sheepfolds;
PSA.78.71	From following 
PSA.78.71	To shepherd Jacob His people,
PSA.78.71	And Israel His inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he shepherded them according to the 
PSA.78.72	And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, the nations have come into 
PSA.79.1	Your holy temple they have defiled;
PSA.79.1	They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
PSA.79.2	The dead bodies of Your servants
PSA.79.2	They have given 
PSA.79.2	The flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem,
PSA.79.3	And 
PSA.79.4	We have become a reproach to our 
PSA.79.4	A scorn and derision to those who are around us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.5	Will You be angry forever?
PSA.79.5	Will Your 
PSA.79.6	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that

PSA.79.8	Oh, do not remember former iniquities against us!
PSA.79.8	Let Your tender mercies come speedily to meet us,
PSA.79.8	For we have been brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.79.9	For the glory of Your name;
PSA.79.9	And deliver us, and provide atonement for our sins,
PSA.79.9	For Your name’s sake!
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say,
PSA.79.10	“Where 
PSA.79.10	Let there be known among the nations in our sight
PSA.79.10	The avenging of the blood of Your servants 
PSA.79.11	Let 
PSA.79.11	According to the greatness of Your power
PSA.79.11	Preserve those who are appointed to die;
PSA.79.12	And return to our neighbors 
PSA.79.12	Their reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So 
PSA.79.13	Will give You thanks forever;
PSA.79.13	We will show forth Your praise to all generations.
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	You who lead Joseph 
PSA.80.1	You who dwell 
PSA.80.2	Before 
PSA.80.2	Stir up Your strength,
PSA.80.2	And come

PSA.80.3	Cause Your face to shine,
PSA.80.3	And we shall be saved!
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.4	How long will You be angry
PSA.80.4	Against the prayer of Your people?
PSA.80.5	You have fed them with the bread of tears,
PSA.80.5	And given them tears to drink in great measure.
PSA.80.6	You have made us a strife to our neighbors,
PSA.80.6	And our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Restore us, O God of hosts;
PSA.80.7	Cause Your face to shine,
PSA.80.7	And we shall be saved!
PSA.80.8	You have brought 
PSA.80.8	You have cast out the nations, and planted it.
PSA.80.9	You prepared 
PSA.80.9	And caused it to take deep root,
PSA.80.9	And it filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The hills were covered with its shadow,
PSA.80.10	And the mighty cedars with its 
PSA.80.11	She sent out her boughs to the Sea,
PSA.80.11	And her branches to the River.
PSA.80.12	Why have You 
PSA.80.12	So that all who pass by the way pluck her 
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the woods uproots it,
PSA.80.13	And the wild beast of the field devours it.
PSA.80.14	Return, we beseech You, O God of hosts;
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see,
PSA.80.14	And visit this vine
PSA.80.15	And the vineyard which Your right hand has planted,
PSA.80.15	And the branch

PSA.80.17	Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,
PSA.80.17	Upon the son of man 
PSA.80.18	Then we will not turn back from You;
PSA.80.18	Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.

PSA.81.2	The pleasant harp with the lute.
PSA.81.3	Blow the trumpet at the time of the New Moon,
PSA.81.3	At the full moon, on our solemn feast day.
PSA.81.4	For 
PSA.81.4	A law of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	This He established in Joseph 
PSA.81.5	When He went throughout the land of Egypt,
PSA.81.5	 I heard a language I did not understand.
PSA.81.6	“I removed his shoulder from the burden;
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the baskets.
PSA.81.7	You called in trouble, and I delivered you;

PSA.81.8	O Israel, if you will listen to Me!
PSA.81.9	There shall be no 
PSA.81.9	Nor shall you worship any foreign god.
PSA.81.10	I 
PSA.81.10	Who brought you out of the land of Egypt;
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	“But My people would not heed My voice,
PSA.81.11	And Israel would

PSA.81.13	That Israel would walk in My ways!
PSA.81.14	I would soon subdue their enemies,

PSA.82.6	I said, 
PSA.82.6	And all of you 
PSA.82.7	But you shall die like men,
PSA.82.7	And fall like one of the princes.”
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth;
PSA.82.8	For You shall inherit all nations.
PSA.83.1	Do
PSA.83.1	Do not hold Your peace,
PSA.83.1	And do not be still, O God!
PSA.83.2	For behold, 
PSA.83.2	And those who hate You have lifted up their head.
PSA.83.3	They have taken crafty counsel against Your people,
PSA.83.3	And consulted together 
PSA.83.4	They have said, “Come, and 
PSA.83.4	That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”
PSA.83.5	For they have consulted together with one consent;

PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

PSA.83.9	As 
PSA.83.9	As 
PSA.83.10	Who perished at En Dor,

PSA.84.3	 Your altars, O 
PSA.84.3	My King and my God.

PSA.84.8	Give ear, O God of Jacob!
PSA.84.9	O God, behold our shield,
PSA.84.9	And look upon the face of Your anointed.
PSA.84.10	For a day in Your courts 
PSA.84.10	I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
PSA.84.10	Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	No good 
PSA.84.11	From those who walk uprightly.
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.84.12	Blessed 
PSA.85.1	, You have been favorable to Your land;
PSA.85.1	You have 
PSA.85.2	You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people;
PSA.85.2	You have covered all their sin.
PSA.85.3	You have taken away all Your wrath;
PSA.85.3	You have turned from the fierceness of Your anger.
PSA.85.4	Restore us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	And cause Your anger toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Will You be angry with us forever?

PSA.85.9	That glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Mercy and truth have met together;
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace have kissed.

PSA.85.12	And our land will yield its increase.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before Him,
PSA.85.13	And shall make His footsteps 
PSA.86.1	Bow down Your ear, O 
PSA.86.1	For I 
PSA.86.2	Preserve my life, for I

PSA.88.6	In darkness, in the depths.
PSA.88.7	Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
PSA.88.7	And You have afflicted

PSA.102.13	For the time to favor her,
PSA.102.13	Yes, the set time, has come.

PSA.102.22	When the peoples are gathered together,
PSA.102.22	And the kingdoms, to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He weakened my strength in the way;
PSA.102.23	He 
PSA.102.24	I said, “O my God,
PSA.102.24	Do not take me away in the midst of my days;
PSA.102.24	Your years 
PSA.102.25	Of old You laid the foundation of the earth,
PSA.102.25	And the heavens 
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but You will endure;
PSA.102.26	Yes, they will all grow old like a garment;
PSA.102.26	Like a cloak You will change them,
PSA.102.26	And they will be changed.
PSA.102.27	But 
PSA.102.27	And Your years will have no end.

PSA.103.12	 far has He 
PSA.103.13	As a father pities 
PSA.103.13	 the 
PSA.103.14	For He knows our frame;
PSA.103.14	He remembers that we 
PSA.103.15	As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
PSA.103.16	And

PSA.104.6	You 
PSA.104.6	The waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At Your rebuke they fled;
PSA.104.7	At the voice of Your thunder they hastened away.
PSA.104.8	They went up over the mountains;
PSA.104.8	They went down into the valleys,
PSA.104.8	To the place which You founded for them.
PSA.104.9	You have 
PSA.104.9	That they may not return to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He sends the springs into the valleys;

PSA.104.23	And to his labor until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom You have made them all.

PSA.104.30	You send forth Your Spirit, they are created;
PSA.104.30	And You renew the face of the earth.
PSA.104.31	May the glory of the

PSA.105.9	And His oath to Isaac,
PSA.105.10	And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,
PSA.105.10	To Israel 
PSA.105.11	Saying, 
PSA.105.11	As the allotment of your inheritance,”
PSA.105.12	When they were few in number,
PSA.105.12	Indeed very few, 
PSA.105.13	When they went from one nation to another,

PSA.105.22	To bind his princes at his pleasure,
PSA.105.22	And teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Israel also came into Egypt,
PSA.105.23	And Jacob dwelt 
PSA.105.24	He increased His people greatly,
PSA.105.24	And made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate His people,

PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood,
PSA.105.29	And killed their fish.
PSA.105.30	Their land abounded with frogs,
PSA.105.30	 in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
PSA.105.31	 lice in all their territory.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.32	 flaming fire in their land.
PSA.105.33	He struck their vines also, and their fig trees,
PSA.105.33	And splintered the trees of their territory.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and locusts came,
PSA.105.34	Young locusts without number,
PSA.105.35	And ate up all the vegetation in their land,
PSA.105.35	And devoured the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	The first of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	He also brought them out with silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	And 
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed,
PSA.105.38	For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering,
PSA.105.39	And fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.40	And 
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and water gushed out;
PSA.105.41	It ran in the dry places 
PSA.105.42	For He remembered 
PSA.105.42	 Abraham His servant.
PSA.105.43	He brought out His people with joy,
PSA.105.43	His chosen ones with gladness.
PSA.105.44	He gave them the lands of the Gentiles,
PSA.105.44	And they inherited the labor of the nations,
PSA.105.45	That they might observe His statutes
PSA.105.45	And keep His laws.
PSA.105.45	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Oh, give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	For His mercy 
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.2	Who can declare all His praise?
PSA.106.3	Blessed 
PSA.106.3	 he who 
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.4	Oh, visit me with Your salvation,
PSA.106.5	That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
PSA.106.5	That I may glory with Your inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers,
PSA.106.6	We have committed iniquity,
PSA.106.6	We have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders;
PSA.106.7	They did not remember the multitude of Your mercies,
PSA.106.7	But rebelled by the sea—the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless He saved them for His name’s sake,
PSA.106.8	That He might make His mighty power known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up;
PSA.106.9	So 
PSA.106.9	As through the wilderness.
PSA.106.10	He 
PSA.106.10	And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	The waters covered their enemies;
PSA.106.11	There was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed His words;
PSA.106.12	They sang His praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgot His works;
PSA.106.13	They did not wait for His counsel,
PSA.106.14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
PSA.106.14	And tested God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	And He gave them their request,
PSA.106.15	But 
PSA.106.16	When 
PSA.106.16	 Aaron the saint of the 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan,
PSA.106.17	And covered the faction of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	A fire was kindled in their company;
PSA.106.18	The flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb,
PSA.106.19	And worshiped the molded image.
PSA.106.20	Thus 
PSA.106.20	Into the image of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God their Savior,
PSA.106.21	Who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	Awesome things by the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
PSA.106.23	Had not Moses His chosen one 
PSA.106.23	To turn away His wrath, lest He destroy 
PSA.106.24	Then they despised 
PSA.106.24	They 
PSA.106.25	But complained in their tents,
PSA.106.25	 did not heed the voice of the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore He raised His hand 
PSA.106.26	To overthrow them in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	To overthrow their descendants among the nations,
PSA.106.27	And to scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor,
PSA.106.28	And ate sacrifices made to the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked 
PSA.106.29	And the plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,
PSA.106.30	And the plague was stopped.
PSA.106.31	And that was accounted to him 
PSA.106.31	To all generations forevermore.
PSA.106.32	They angered 
PSA.106.32	So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;
PSA.106.33	Because they rebelled against His Spirit,
PSA.106.33	So that he spoke rashly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples,
PSA.106.34	Concerning whom the 
PSA.106.35	But they mingled with the Gentiles
PSA.106.35	And learned their works;
PSA.106.36	They served their idols,
PSA.106.36	Which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their sons
PSA.106.37	And their daughters to 
PSA.106.38	And shed innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	The blood of their sons and daughters,
PSA.106.38	Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;
PSA.106.38	And 
PSA.106.39	Thus they were 
PSA.106.39	And 
PSA.106.40	Therefore 
PSA.106.40	So that He abhorred 
PSA.106.41	And 
PSA.106.41	And those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	Many times He delivered them;
PSA.106.43	But they rebelled in their counsel,
PSA.106.43	And were brought low for their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless He regarded their affliction,
PSA.106.44	When 
PSA.106.45	And for their sake He remembered His covenant,
PSA.106.45	And 
PSA.106.46	He also made them to be pitied
PSA.106.46	By all those who carried them away captive.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O 
PSA.106.47	And gather us from among the Gentiles,
PSA.106.47	To give thanks to Your holy name,
PSA.106.47	To triumph in Your praise.
PSA.106.48	Blessed 
PSA.106.48	From everlasting to everlasting!
PSA.106.48	And let all the people say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.107.1	Oh, 
PSA.107.1	For His mercy 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.2	Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,
PSA.107.3	And 
PSA.107.3	From the east and from the west,
PSA.107.3	From the north and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in 
PSA.107.4	They found no city to dwell in.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	Their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.6	 He delivered them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.7	And He led them forth by the 
PSA.107.7	That they might go to a city for a dwelling place.
PSA.107.8	Oh, that 
PSA.107.8	And 
PSA.107.9	For 
PSA.107.9	And fills the hungry soul with goodness.
PSA.107.10	Those who 
PSA.107.10	Bound in affliction and irons—
PSA.107.11	Because they 
PSA.107.11	And despised 
PSA.107.12	Therefore He brought down their heart with labor;
PSA.107.12	They fell down, and 
PSA.107.13	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.13	 He saved them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
PSA.107.14	And broke their chains in pieces.
PSA.107.15	Oh, that 
PSA.107.15	And 
PSA.107.16	For He has 
PSA.107.16	And cut the bars of iron in two.
PSA.107.17	Fools, 
PSA.107.17	And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorred all manner of food,
PSA.107.18	And they 
PSA.107.19	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.19	 He saved them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.20	He sent His word and 
PSA.107.20	And 
PSA.107.21	Oh, that 
PSA.107.21	And 
PSA.107.22	Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	And 
PSA.107.23	Those who go down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	Who do business on great waters,
PSA.107.24	They see the works of the 
PSA.107.24	And His wonders in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For He commands and 
PSA.107.25	Which lifts up the waves of the sea.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the heavens,
PSA.107.26	They go down again to the depths;
PSA.107.26	Their soul melts because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
PSA.107.27	And are at their wits’ end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cry out to the 
PSA.107.28	And He brings them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.29	He calms the storm,
PSA.107.29	So that its waves are still.
PSA.107.30	Then they are glad because they are quiet;
PSA.107.30	So He guides them to their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Oh, that 
PSA.107.31	And 
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt Him also 
PSA.107.32	And praise Him in the company of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He 
PSA.107.33	And the watersprings into dry ground;
PSA.107.34	A 
PSA.107.34	For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
PSA.107.35	He turns a wilderness into pools of water,
PSA.107.35	And dry land into watersprings.
PSA.107.36	There He makes the hungry dwell,
PSA.107.36	That they may establish a city for a dwelling place,
PSA.107.37	And sow fields and plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	That they may yield a fruitful harvest.
PSA.107.38	He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly;
PSA.107.38	And He does not let their cattle 
PSA.107.39	When they are 
PSA.107.39	Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow,
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt on princes,
PSA.107.40	And causes them to wander in the wilderness 
PSA.107.41	Yet He sets the poor on high, far from affliction,
PSA.107.41	And 
PSA.107.42	The righteous see 
PSA.107.42	And all 
PSA.107.43	Whoever

PSA.108.3	I will praise You, O 
PSA.108.3	And I will sing praises to You among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For Your mercy 
PSA.108.4	And Your truth 
PSA.108.5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
PSA.108.5	And Your glory above all the earth;
PSA.108.6	That Your beloved may be delivered,
PSA.108.6	Save 
PSA.108.7	God has spoken in His holiness:
PSA.108.7	“I will rejoice;
PSA.108.7	I will divide Shechem
PSA.108.7	And measure out the Valley of Succoth.

PSA.108.8	Judah 
PSA.108.9	Moab 
PSA.108.9	Over Edom I will cast My shoe;
PSA.108.9	Over Philistia I will triumph.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me 
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	And 
PSA.108.12	Give us help from trouble,
PSA.108.12	For the help of man is useless.
PSA.108.13	Through God we will do valiantly,
PSA.108.13	For 
PSA.109.1	Do
PSA.109.1	O God of my praise!
PSA.109.2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful
PSA.109.2	Have opened against me;
PSA.109.2	They have spoken against me with a 
PSA.109.3	They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,
PSA.109.3	And fought against me 
PSA.109.4	In return for my love they are my accusers,
PSA.109.4	But I

PSA.109.11	Let the creditor seize all that he has,
PSA.109.11	And let strangers plunder his labor.
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend mercy to him,
PSA.109.12	Nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off,
PSA.109.13	 in the generation following let their

PSA.109.20	And to those who speak evil against my person.

PRO.5.3	For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey,
PRO.5.3	And her mouth 
PRO.5.4	But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	Sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death,
PRO.5.5	Her steps lay hold of hell.
PRO.5.6	Lest you ponder 
PRO.5.6	Her ways are unstable;
PRO.5.6	You do not know 
PRO.5.7	Therefore hear me now, 
PRO.5.7	And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Remove your way far from her,
PRO.5.8	And do not go near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	Lest you give your honor to others,
PRO.5.9	And your years to the cruel

PRO.5.10	And your labors

PRO.5.12	And say:
PRO.5.12	“How I have hated instruction,
PRO.5.12	And my heart despised correction!
PRO.5.13	I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
PRO.5.13	Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I was on the verge of total ruin,
PRO.5.14	In the midst of the assembly and congregation.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern,
PRO.5.15	And running water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your fountains be dispersed abroad,
PRO.5.16	Streams of water in the streets?

PRO.5.17	And not for strangers with you.
PRO.5.18	Let your fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	And rejoice with 
PRO.5.19	Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
PRO.5.19	And always be enraptured with her love.
PRO.5.20	For why should you, my son, be enraptured by 
PRO.5.20	And be embraced in the arms of a seductress?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man 
PRO.5.21	And He ponders all his paths.
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities entrap the wicked 
PRO.5.22	And he is caught in the cords of his sin.
PRO.5.23	He shall die for lack of instruction,

PRO.6.1	My son, 
PRO.6.1	 you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
PRO.6.2	You are snared by the words of your mouth;
PRO.6.2	You are taken by the words of your mouth.
PRO.6.3	So do this, my son, and deliver yourself;
PRO.6.3	For you have come into the hand of your friend:
PRO.6.3	Go and humble yourself;
PRO.6.3	Plead with your friend.
PRO.6.4	Give no sleep to your eyes,
PRO.6.4	Nor slumber to your eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand 
PRO.6.5	And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, you sluggard!
PRO.6.6	Consider her ways and be wise,
PRO.6.7	Which, having no captain,
PRO.6.7	Overseer or ruler,
PRO.6.8	Provides her supplies in the summer,
PRO.6.8	 gathers her food in the harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you slumber, O sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When will you rise from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	A little folding of the hands to sleep—
PRO.6.11	So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler,
PRO.6.11	And your need like an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A worthless person, a wicked man,
PRO.6.12	Walks with a perverse mouth;
PRO.6.13	He winks with his eyes,
PRO.6.13	He shuffles his feet,
PRO.6.13	He points with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	Perversity 
PRO.6.14	He devises evil continually,
PRO.6.14	He sows discord.
PRO.6.15	Therefore his calamity shall come 
PRO.6.15	Suddenly he shall 
PRO.6.16	These six 
PRO.6.16	Yes, seven

PRO.6.17	A lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	Hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	A heart that devises wicked plans,
PRO.6.18	Feet that are swift in running to evil,

PRO.6.20	And do not forsake the law of your mother.
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually upon your heart;

PRO.6.25	Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,
PRO.6.25	Nor let her allure you with her eyelids.

PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire to his bosom,
PRO.6.27	And his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can one walk on hot coals,

PRO.6.29	So 
PRO.6.29	Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.
PRO.6.30	 do not despise a thief
PRO.6.30	If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving.
PRO.6.31	Yet 
PRO.6.31	He may have to give up all the substance of his house.
PRO.6.32	Whoever commits adultery with a woman 
PRO.6.32	He 
PRO.6.33	Wounds and dishonor he will get,
PRO.6.33	And his reproach will not be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For 
PRO.6.34	Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will accept no recompense,
PRO.6.35	Nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words,
PRO.7.1	And 
PRO.7.2	Keep my commands and live,
PRO.7.2	And my law as the apple of your eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them on your fingers;
PRO.7.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “You 
PRO.7.4	And call understanding 
PRO.7.5	That they may keep you from the immoral woman,
PRO.7.5	From the seductress 
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked through my lattice,
PRO.7.7	And saw among the simple,
PRO.7.7	I perceived among the youths,
PRO.7.7	A young man 
PRO.7.8	Passing along the street near her corner;
PRO.7.8	And he took the path to her house
PRO.7.9	In the twilight, in the evening,
PRO.7.9	In the black and dark night.
PRO.7.10	And there a woman met him,
PRO.7.10	 the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart.
PRO.7.11	She 
PRO.7.11	Her feet would not stay at home.
PRO.7.12	At times 
PRO.7.12	Lurking at every corner.
PRO.7.13	So she caught him and kissed him;
PRO.7.13	With an impudent face she said to him:
PRO.7.14	“
PRO.7.14	Today I have paid my vows.
PRO.7.15	So I came out to meet you,
PRO.7.15	Diligently to seek your face,
PRO.7.15	And I have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have spread my bed with tapestry,
PRO.7.16	Colored coverings of 
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love until morning;
PRO.7.18	Let us delight ourselves with love.
PRO.7.19	For my husband 
PRO.7.19	He has gone on a long journey;
PRO.7.20	He has taken a bag of money with him,
PRO.7.20	 will come home on the appointed day.”
PRO.7.21	With 
PRO.7.21	With her flattering lips she seduced him.
PRO.7.22	Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,
PRO.7.23	Till an arrow struck his liver.
PRO.7.23	As a bird hastens to the snare,
PRO.7.23	He did not know it 
PRO.7.24	Now therefore, listen to me, 
PRO.7.24	Pay attention to the words of my mouth:
PRO.7.25	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,
PRO.7.25	Do not stray into her paths;
PRO.7.26	For she has cast down many wounded,
PRO.7.26	And 
PRO.7.27	Her house 
PRO.7.27	Descending to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Does not 
PRO.8.1	And understanding lift up her voice?
PRO.8.2	She takes her stand on the top of the high hill,
PRO.8.2	Beside the way, where the paths meet.
PRO.8.3	She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city,
PRO.8.3	At the entrance of the doors:
PRO.8.4	“To you, O men, I call,
PRO.8.4	And my voice 
PRO.8.5	O you simple ones, understand prudence,
PRO.8.5	And you fools, be of an understanding heart.

PRO.8.29	When He assigned to the sea its limit,
PRO.8.29	So that the waters would not transgress His command,
PRO.8.29	When 
PRO.8.30	Then I was beside Him
PRO.8.30	And I was daily

PRO.22.27	Why should he take away your bed from under you?
PRO.22.28	Do not remove the ancient landmark
PRO.22.28	Which your fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Do you see a man

PRO.23.16	Yes, my inmost being will rejoice
PRO.23.16	When your lips speak right things.
PRO.23.17	Do not let your heart envy sinners,

PRO.24.30	And by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding;
PRO.24.31	And there it was, 
PRO.24.31	Its surface was covered with nettles;
PRO.24.31	Its stone wall was broken down.

PRO.26.26	His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.
PRO.26.27	Whoever digs a pit will fall into it,
PRO.26.27	And he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.

PRO.30.17	The eye 
PRO.30.17	And scorns obedience to 
PRO.30.17	The ravens of the valley will pick it out,
PRO.30.17	And the young eagles will eat it.
PRO.30.18	There are three 
PRO.30.18	Yes, four 
PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the air,
PRO.30.19	The way of a serpent on a rock,
PRO.30.19	The way of a ship in the midst of the sea,
PRO.30.19	And the way of a man with a virgin.
PRO.30.20	This 
PRO.30.20	She eats and wipes her mouth,
PRO.30.20	And says, “I have done no wickedness.”
PRO.30.21	For three 
PRO.30.21	Yes, for four it cannot bear up:
PRO.30.22	For a servant when he reigns,
PRO.30.22	A fool when he is filled with food,
PRO.30.23	A hateful 
PRO.30.23	And a maidservant who succeeds her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There are four 
PRO.30.24	But they 
PRO.30.25	The ants 
PRO.30.25	Yet they prepare their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	The rock badgers are a feeble folk,
PRO.30.26	Yet they make their homes in the crags;
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	Yet they all advance in ranks;
PRO.30.28	The spider skillfully grasps with its hands,
PRO.30.28	And it is in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	There are three 
PRO.30.29	Yes, four 
PRO.30.30	A lion, 
PRO.30.30	And does not turn away from any;
PRO.30.31	A greyhound,
PRO.30.31	A male goat also,
PRO.30.31	And a king

PRO.30.32	Or if you have devised evil,

PRO.30.33	So the forcing of wrath produces strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him:
PRO.31.2	What, my son?
PRO.31.2	And what, son of my womb?
PRO.31.2	And what, 
PRO.31.3	Do not give your strength to women,
PRO.31.3	Nor your ways 
PRO.31.4	Nor for princes intoxicating drink;
PRO.31.5	Lest they drink and forget the law,
PRO.31.5	And pervert the justice of all the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink to him who is perishing,
PRO.31.6	And wine to those who are bitter of heart.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink and forget his poverty,
PRO.31.7	And remember his misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth for the speechless,
PRO.31.8	In the cause of all 
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, 
PRO.31.9	And 
PRO.31.10	Who can find a virtuous wife?
PRO.31.10	For her worth 
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband safely trusts her;
PRO.31.11	So he will have no lack of gain.
PRO.31.12	She does him good and not evil
PRO.31.12	All the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeks wool and flax,
PRO.31.13	And willingly works with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchant ships,
PRO.31.14	She brings her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She also rises while it is yet night,
PRO.31.15	And 
PRO.31.15	And a portion for her maidservants.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field and buys it;
PRO.31.16	From her profits she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girds herself with strength,
PRO.31.17	And strengthens her arms.
PRO.31.18	She perceives that her merchandise 
PRO.31.18	And her lamp does not go out by night.
PRO.31.19	She stretches out her hands to the distaff,
PRO.31.19	And her hand holds the spindle.
PRO.31.20	She extends her hand to the poor,
PRO.31.20	Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of snow for her household,
PRO.31.21	For all her household 
PRO.31.22	She makes tapestry for herself;
PRO.31.22	Her clothing 
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates,
PRO.31.23	When he sits among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes linen garments and sells 
PRO.31.24	And supplies sashes for the merchants.
PRO.31.25	Strength and honor 
PRO.31.25	She shall rejoice in time to come.
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth with wisdom,
PRO.31.26	And on her tongue 
PRO.31.27	She watches over the ways of her household,
PRO.31.27	And does not eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up and call her blessed;
PRO.31.28	Her husband 
PRO.31.29	“Many daughters have done well,
PRO.31.29	But you excel them all.”
PRO.31.30	Charm 
PRO.31.30	But a woman 
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands,
PRO.31.31	And let her own works praise her in the gates.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, 
ECC.1.2	“Vanity
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities, 
ECC.1.3	What profit has a man from all his labor
ECC.1.3	In which he toils under the sun?
ECC.1.4	 generation passes away, and 
ECC.1.4	But the earth abides forever.
ECC.1.5	The sun also rises, and the sun goes down,
ECC.1.5	And hastens to the place where it arose.
ECC.1.6	The wind goes toward the south,
ECC.1.6	And turns around to the north;
ECC.1.6	The wind whirls about continually,
ECC.1.6	And comes again on its circuit.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea,
ECC.1.7	Yet the sea 
ECC.1.7	To the place from which the rivers come,
ECC.1.7	There they return again.
ECC.1.8	All things 
ECC.1.8	Man cannot express 
ECC.1.8	The eye is not satisfied with seeing,
ECC.1.8	Nor the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	That which has been 
ECC.1.9	That which 
ECC.1.9	And 
ECC.1.10	Is there anything of which it may be said,
ECC.1.10	“See, this 
ECC.1.10	It has already been in ancient times before us.
ECC.1.11	Nor will there be any remembrance of 
ECC.1.11	By 
ECC.1.12	I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	And I set my heart to seek and 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all 
ECC.1.15	And what is lacking cannot be numbered.
ECC.1.16	I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained 
ECC.1.17	And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.
ECC.1.18	For 
ECC.1.18	And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I said 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter—“Madness!”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?” 
ECC.2.3	I searched in my heart 
ECC.2.4	I made my works great, I built myself 
ECC.2.5	I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all 
ECC.2.6	I made myself water pools from which to water the growing trees of the grove. 
ECC.2.7	I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me. 
ECC.2.8	I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, 
ECC.2.9	So I became great and excelled 
ECC.2.10	Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.
ECC.2.10	I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,
ECC.2.10	For my heart rejoiced in all my labor;
ECC.2.10	And 
ECC.2.11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done
ECC.2.11	And on the labor in which I had toiled;
ECC.2.11	And indeed all 
ECC.2.12	Then I turned myself to consider wisdom 
ECC.2.12	For what 
ECC.2.12	 what he has already 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom 
ECC.2.13	As light excels darkness.
ECC.2.14	The wise man’s eyes 
ECC.2.14	But the fool walks in darkness.
ECC.2.14	Yet I myself perceived
ECC.2.14	That 
ECC.2.15	So I said in my heart,
ECC.2.15	“As it happens to the fool,
ECC.2.15	It also happens to me,
ECC.2.15	And why was I then more wise?”
ECC.2.15	Then I said in my heart,
ECC.2.15	“This also 
ECC.2.16	For 
ECC.2.16	Since all that now 
ECC.2.16	And how does a wise 
ECC.2.16	As the fool!
ECC.2.17	Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun 
ECC.2.18	Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because 
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also 
ECC.2.20	Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labor 
ECC.2.22	For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	For all his days 
ECC.2.24	Nothing 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? 
ECC.2.26	For 
ECC.3.1	To everything 
ECC.3.1	A 
ECC.3.2	A time to be born,
ECC.3.2	And 
ECC.3.2	A time to plant,
ECC.3.2	And a time to pluck 
ECC.3.3	A time to kill,
ECC.3.3	And a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	A time to break down,
ECC.3.3	And a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	A time to 
ECC.3.4	And a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	A time to mourn,
ECC.3.4	And a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	A time to cast away stones,
ECC.3.5	And a time to gather stones;
ECC.3.5	A time to embrace,
ECC.3.5	And a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	A time to gain,
ECC.3.6	And a time to lose;
ECC.3.6	A time to keep,
ECC.3.6	And a time to throw away;
ECC.3.7	A time to tear,
ECC.3.7	And a time to sew;
ECC.3.7	A time to keep silence,
ECC.3.7	And a time to 
ECC.3.8	A time to love,
ECC.3.8	And a time to 
ECC.3.8	A time of war,
ECC.3.8	And a time of peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit has the worker from that in which he labors? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the God-given task with which the sons of men are to be occupied. 
ECC.3.11	He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that 
ECC.3.12	I know that nothing 
ECC.3.13	and also that 
ECC.3.14	I know that whatever God does,
ECC.3.14	It shall be forever.
ECC.3.14	Nothing can be added to it,
ECC.3.14	And nothing taken from it.
ECC.3.14	God does 
ECC.3.15	That which is has already been,
ECC.3.15	And what is to be has already been;
ECC.3.15	And God requires an account of what is past.
ECC.3.16	Moreover 
ECC.3.16	 the place of judgment,
ECC.3.16	Wickedness 
ECC.3.16	And 
ECC.3.16	Iniquity 
ECC.3.17	I said in my heart,
ECC.3.17	“God shall judge the righteous and the wicked,
ECC.3.17	For 
ECC.3.18	I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are 
ECC.3.19	For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all 
ECC.3.20	All go to one place: 
ECC.3.21	Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	So I perceived that nothing 
ECC.4.1	Then I returned and considered all the 
ECC.4.1	And look! The tears of the oppressed,
ECC.4.1	But they have no comforter—
ECC.4.1	On the side of their oppressors 
ECC.4.1	But they have no comforter.
ECC.4.2	Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead,
ECC.4.2	More than the living who are still alive.
ECC.4.3	Yet, better than both 
ECC.4.3	Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor. This also 
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands
ECC.4.5	And consumes his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better a handful 
ECC.4.6	Than both hands full, 
ECC.4.7	Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:
ECC.4.8	There is one alone, without companion:
ECC.4.8	He has neither son nor brother.
ECC.4.8	Yet 
ECC.4.8	Nor is his 
ECC.4.8	“For whom do I toil and deprive myself of 
ECC.4.8	This also 
ECC.4.9	Two 
ECC.4.9	Because they have a good reward for their labor.
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, one will lift up his companion.
ECC.4.10	But woe to him 
ECC.4.10	For 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm;
ECC.4.11	But how can one be warm 
ECC.4.12	Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him.
ECC.4.12	And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better a poor and wise youth
ECC.4.13	Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more.
ECC.4.14	For he comes out of prison to be king,
ECC.4.14	Although he was born poor in his kingdom.
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living who walk under the sun;
ECC.4.15	They were with the second youth who stands in his place.
ECC.4.16	Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him.
ECC.4.16	Surely this also 
ECC.5.1	Walk 
ECC.5.2	Do not be 
ECC.5.2	And let not your heart utter anything hastily before God.
ECC.5.2	For God 
ECC.5.2	Therefore let your words 
ECC.5.3	For a dream comes through much activity,
ECC.5.3	And 
ECC.5.4	When you make a vow to God, do not delay to 
ECC.5.4	For 
ECC.5.4	Pay what you have vowed—
ECC.5.5	Better not to vow than to vow and not pay.
ECC.5.6	Do not let your 
ECC.5.7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words 
ECC.5.8	If you 
ECC.5.9	Moreover the profit of the land is for all; 
ECC.5.10	He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver;
ECC.5.10	Nor he who loves abundance, with increase.
ECC.5.10	This also 
ECC.5.11	When goods increase,
ECC.5.11	They increase who eat them;
ECC.5.11	So what profit have the owners
ECC.5.11	Except to see 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a laboring man 
ECC.5.12	Whether he eats little or much;
ECC.5.12	But the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a severe evil 
ECC.5.13	Riches kept for their owner to his hurt.
ECC.5.14	But those riches perish through misfortune;
ECC.5.14	When he begets a son, 
ECC.5.15	As he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return,
ECC.5.15	To go as he came;
ECC.5.15	And he shall take nothing from his labor
ECC.5.15	Which he may carry away in his hand.
ECC.5.16	And this also 
ECC.5.16	Just exactly as he came, so shall he go.
ECC.5.16	And 
ECC.5.17	All his days 
ECC.5.17	And 
ECC.5.18	Here is what I have seen: 
ECC.5.19	As for 
ECC.5.20	For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps 
ECC.6.1	There
ECC.6.2	A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, 
ECC.6.3	If a man begets a hundred 
ECC.6.4	for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. 
ECC.6.5	Though it has not seen the sun or known 
ECC.6.6	even if he lives a thousand years twice—but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one 
ECC.6.7	All the labor of man 
ECC.6.7	And yet the soul is not satisfied.
ECC.6.8	For what more has the wise 
ECC.6.8	What does the poor man have,
ECC.6.8	Who knows 
ECC.6.9	Better 
ECC.6.9	This also 
ECC.6.10	Whatever one is, he has been named 
ECC.6.10	For it is known that he 
ECC.6.10	And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.
ECC.6.11	Since there are many things that increase vanity,
ECC.6.11	How 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what 
ECC.7.1	A 
ECC.7.1	And the day of death than the day of one’s 
ECC.7.2	Better to go to the house of mourning
ECC.7.2	Than to go to the house of feasting,
ECC.7.2	For that 
ECC.7.2	And the living will take 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow 
ECC.7.3	For by a sad countenance the heart is made better.
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise 
ECC.7.4	But the heart of fools 
ECC.7.5	Than for a man to hear the song of fools.
ECC.7.6	For like the crackling of thorns under a pot,
ECC.7.6	So 
ECC.7.6	This also is vanity.
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression destroys a wise 
ECC.7.7	And a bribe debases the heart.
ECC.7.8	The end of a thing 
ECC.7.8	The patient in spirit 
ECC.7.9	Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry,
ECC.7.9	For anger rests in the bosom of fools.
ECC.7.10	Do not say,
ECC.7.10	“Why were the former days better than these?”
ECC.7.10	For you do not inquire wisely concerning this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom 
ECC.7.11	And profitable 
ECC.7.12	For wisdom 
ECC.7.12	But the excellence of knowledge 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God;
ECC.7.13	For 
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful,
ECC.7.14	But in the day of adversity consider:
ECC.7.14	Surely God has appointed the one as well as the other,
ECC.7.14	So that man can find out nothing 
ECC.7.15	I have seen everything in my days of vanity:
ECC.7.15	There is a just 
ECC.7.15	And there is a wicked 
ECC.7.16	Do not be overly righteous,
ECC.7.16	Nor be overly wise:
ECC.7.16	Why should you destroy yourself?
ECC.7.17	Do not be overly wicked,
ECC.7.17	Nor be foolish:
ECC.7.17	Why should you die before your time?
ECC.7.18	And also not remove your hand from the other;
ECC.7.18	For he who 
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengthens the wise
ECC.7.19	More than ten rulers of the city.
ECC.7.20	For 
ECC.7.20	And does not sin.
ECC.7.21	Also do not take to heart everything people say,
ECC.7.21	Lest you hear your servant cursing you.
ECC.7.22	For many times, also, your own heart has known
ECC.7.22	That even you have cursed others.
ECC.7.23	All this I have proved by wisdom.
ECC.7.23	I said, “I will be wise”;
ECC.7.23	But it 
ECC.7.24	As for that which is far off and 
ECC.7.24	Who can find it out?
ECC.7.25	I applied my heart to know,
ECC.7.25	To search and seek out wisdom and the reason 
ECC.7.25	To know the wickedness of folly,
ECC.7.25	Even of foolishness 
ECC.7.26	And I find more bitter than death
ECC.7.26	The woman whose heart 
ECC.7.26	Whose hands 
ECC.7.26	He who pleases God shall escape from her,
ECC.7.26	But the sinner shall be trapped by her.
ECC.7.27	Here is what I have found,” says 
ECC.7.27	“
ECC.7.28	Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find:
ECC.7.28	One man among a thousand I have found,
ECC.7.28	But a woman among all these I have not found.
ECC.7.29	Truly, this only I have found:
ECC.7.29	That God made man upright,
ECC.7.29	But 
ECC.8.1	Who 
ECC.8.1	And who knows the interpretation of a thing?
ECC.8.1	A man’s wisdom makes his face shine,
ECC.8.1	And 
ECC.8.2	I 
ECC.8.3	Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.”
ECC.8.4	Where the word of a king 
ECC.8.4	And 
ECC.8.5	He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful;
ECC.8.5	And a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment,
ECC.8.6	Because 
ECC.8.6	Though the misery of man increases greatly.
ECC.8.7	For he does not know what will happen;
ECC.8.7	So who can tell him when it will occur?
ECC.8.8	No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit,
ECC.8.8	And no one has power in the day of death.
ECC.8.8	And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.
ECC.8.9	All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: 
ECC.8.10	Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were 
ECC.8.11	Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner does evil a hundred 
ECC.8.13	But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong 
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just 
ECC.8.15	So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor 
ECC.8.16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night, 
ECC.8.17	then I saw all the work of God, that 
ECC.9.1	For I considered all this in my heart, so that I could declare it all: 
ECC.9.2	All things 
ECC.9.2	One event 
ECC.9.2	To the good, the clean, and the unclean;
ECC.9.2	To him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice.
ECC.9.2	As is the good, so 
ECC.9.2	He who takes an oath as 
ECC.9.3	This 
ECC.9.4	But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die;
ECC.9.5	But 
ECC.9.5	And they have no more reward,
ECC.9.5	For 
ECC.9.6	Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished;
ECC.9.6	Nevermore will they have a share
ECC.9.6	In anything done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go, 
ECC.9.7	And drink your wine with a merry heart;
ECC.9.7	For God has already accepted your works.
ECC.9.8	Let your garments always be white,
ECC.9.8	And let your head lack no oil.
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do 
ECC.9.11	I returned 
ECC.9.11	The race 
ECC.9.11	Nor the battle to the strong,
ECC.9.11	Nor bread to the wise,
ECC.9.11	Nor riches to men of understanding,
ECC.9.11	Nor favor to men of skill;
ECC.9.11	But time and 
ECC.9.12	For 
ECC.9.12	Like fish taken in a cruel net,
ECC.9.12	Like birds caught in a snare,
ECC.9.12	So the sons of men 
ECC.9.12	When it falls suddenly upon them.
ECC.9.13	This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it 
ECC.9.15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man.
ECC.9.16	Then I said:
ECC.9.16	“Wisdom 
ECC.9.16	Nevertheless 
ECC.9.16	And his words are not heard.
ECC.9.17	Words of the wise, 
ECC.9.17	Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom 
ECC.9.18	But 
ECC.10.1	Dead flies putrefy the perfumer’s ointment,
ECC.10.1	And cause it to give off a foul odor;
ECC.10.2	A wise man’s heart 
ECC.10.2	But a fool’s heart at his left.
ECC.10.3	Even when a fool walks along the way,
ECC.10.3	He lacks wisdom,
ECC.10.3	And he shows everyone 
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rises against you,
ECC.10.4	Do not leave your post;
ECC.10.4	For 
ECC.10.5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun,
ECC.10.5	As an error proceeding from the ruler:
ECC.10.6	Folly is set in great dignity,
ECC.10.6	While the rich sit in a lowly place.
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants 
ECC.10.7	While princes walk on the ground like servants.
ECC.10.8	He who digs a pit will fall into it,
ECC.10.8	And whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.
ECC.10.9	He who quarries stones may be hurt by them,
ECC.10.9	 he who splits wood may be endangered by it.
ECC.10.10	If the ax is dull,
ECC.10.10	And one does not sharpen the edge,
ECC.10.10	Then he must use more strength;
ECC.10.10	But wisdom brings success.
ECC.10.11	A serpent may bite 
ECC.10.11	The babbler is no different.
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man’s mouth 
ECC.10.12	But 
ECC.10.13	The words of his mouth begin with foolishness,
ECC.10.13	And the end of his talk 
ECC.10.14	A fool also multiplies words.
ECC.10.14	No man knows what is to be;
ECC.10.14	Who can tell him 
ECC.10.15	The labor of fools wearies them,
ECC.10.15	For they do not even know how to go to the city!
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, O land, when your king 
ECC.10.16	And your princes feast in the morning!
ECC.10.17	Blessed 
ECC.10.17	And your 
ECC.10.17	For strength and not for drunkenness!
ECC.10.18	Because of laziness the building decays,
ECC.10.18	And 
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter,
ECC.10.19	And 
ECC.10.19	But money answers everything.
ECC.10.20	Do not curse the king, even in your thought;
ECC.10.20	Do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom;
ECC.10.20	For a bird of the air may carry your voice,
ECC.10.20	And a bird in flight may tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast your bread 
ECC.11.1	For you will find it after many days.
ECC.11.2	Give a serving 
ECC.11.2	For you do not know what evil will be on the earth.
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full of rain,
ECC.11.3	They empty 
ECC.11.3	And if a tree falls to the south or the north,
ECC.11.3	In the place where the tree falls, there it shall lie.
ECC.11.4	He who observes the wind will not sow,
ECC.11.4	And he who regards the clouds will not reap.
ECC.11.5	As 
ECC.11.5	 how the bones 
ECC.11.5	So you do not know the works of God who makes everything.
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow your seed,
ECC.11.6	And in the evening do not withhold your hand;
ECC.11.6	For you do not know which will prosper,
ECC.11.6	Either this or that,
ECC.11.6	Or whether both alike 
ECC.11.7	Truly the light is sweet,
ECC.11.7	And 
ECC.11.8	But if a man lives many years
ECC.11.8	Yet let him 
ECC.11.8	For they will be many.
ECC.11.8	All that is coming 
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in your youth,
ECC.11.9	And let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth;
ECC.11.9	Walk in the ways of your heart,
ECC.11.9	And in the sight of your eyes;
ECC.11.9	But know that for all these
ECC.11.9	God will bring you into judgment.
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from your heart,
ECC.11.10	And 
ECC.11.10	For childhood and youth 
ECC.12.1	Remember
ECC.12.1	Before the difficult days come,
ECC.12.1	And the years draw near 
ECC.12.1	“I have no pleasure in them”:
ECC.12.2	While the sun and the light,
ECC.12.2	The moon and the stars,
ECC.12.2	Are not darkened,
ECC.12.2	And the clouds do not return after the rain;
ECC.12.3	In the day when the keepers of the house tremble,
ECC.12.3	And the strong men bow down;
ECC.12.3	When the grinders cease because they are few,
ECC.12.3	And those that look through the windows grow dim;
ECC.12.4	When the doors are shut in the streets,
ECC.12.4	And the sound of grinding is low;
ECC.12.4	When one rises up at the sound of a bird,
ECC.12.4	And all 
ECC.12.5	Also they are afraid of height,
ECC.12.5	And of terrors in the way;
ECC.12.5	When the almond tree blossoms,
ECC.12.5	The grasshopper is a burden,
ECC.12.5	And desire fails.
ECC.12.5	For man goes to 
ECC.12.5	And 
ECC.12.6	Or the golden bowl is broken,
ECC.12.6	Or the pitcher shattered at the fountain,
ECC.12.6	Or the wheel broken at the well.
ECC.12.7	Then the dust will return to the earth as it was,
ECC.12.7	And the spirit will return to God 
ECC.12.8	“Vanity
ECC.12.8	“All 
ECC.12.9	And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yes, he pondered and sought out 
ECC.12.10	The Preacher sought to find acceptable words; and 
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are like goads, and the words of scholars are like well-driven nails, given by one Shepherd. 
ECC.12.12	And further, my son, be admonished by these. Of making many books 
ECC.12.13	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:
ECC.12.13	Fear God and keep His commandments,
ECC.12.13	For this is man’s all.
ECC.12.14	For 
ECC.12.14	Including every secret thing,
ECC.12.14	Whether good or evil.
SNG.1.1	The 
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—
SNG.1.2	For your love 
SNG.1.3	Because of the fragrance of your good ointments,
SNG.1.3	Your name 
SNG.1.3	Therefore the virgins love you.
SNG.1.4	Draw me away!
SNG.1.4	We will run after you.
SNG.1.4	The king 
SNG.1.4	We will be glad and rejoice in you.
SNG.1.4	We will remember your love more than wine.
SNG.1.4	Rightly do they love you.
SNG.1.5	I 
SNG.1.5	O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	Like the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	Like the curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Do not look upon me, because I 
SNG.1.6	Because the sun has tanned me.
SNG.1.6	My mother’s sons were angry with me;
SNG.1.6	They made me the keeper of the vineyards,
SNG.1.6	 my own 
SNG.1.7	Tell me, O you whom I love,
SNG.1.7	Where you feed 
SNG.1.7	Where you make 
SNG.1.7	For why should I be as one who veils herself
SNG.1.7	By the flocks of your companions?
SNG.1.8	If you do not know, 
SNG.1.8	Follow in the footsteps of the flock,
SNG.1.8	And feed your little goats
SNG.1.8	Beside the shepherds’ tents.
SNG.1.9	I have compared you, 
SNG.1.9	To my filly among Pharaoh’s chariots.
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
SNG.1.10	Your neck with chains 
SNG.1.11	We will make you ornaments of gold
SNG.1.11	With studs of silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king 
SNG.1.12	My spikenard sends forth its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	A bundle of myrrh 
SNG.1.13	That lies all night between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved 
SNG.1.14	In the vineyards of En Gedi.
SNG.1.15	Behold, you 
SNG.1.15	Behold, you 
SNG.1.15	You 
SNG.1.16	Behold, you 
SNG.1.16	Yes, pleasant!
SNG.1.16	Also our bed 
SNG.1.17	The beams of our houses 
SNG.1.17	 our rafters of fir.
SNG.2.1	I 
SNG.2.1	 the lily of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among thorns,
SNG.2.2	So is my love among the daughters.
SNG.2.3	Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods,
SNG.2.3	So 
SNG.2.3	I sat down in his shade with great delight,
SNG.2.3	And 
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banqueting house,
SNG.2.4	And his banner over me 
SNG.2.5	Sustain me with cakes of raisins,
SNG.2.5	Refresh me with apples,
SNG.2.5	For I 
SNG.2.6	His left hand 
SNG.2.6	And his right hand embraces me.
SNG.2.7	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	By the gazelles or by the does of the field,
SNG.2.7	Do not stir up nor awaken love
SNG.2.7	Until it pleases.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved!
SNG.2.8	Behold, he comes
SNG.2.8	Leaping upon the mountains,
SNG.2.8	Skipping upon the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Behold, he stands behind our wall;
SNG.2.9	He is looking through the windows,
SNG.2.9	Gazing through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spoke, and said to me:
SNG.2.10	“Rise up, my love, my fair one,
SNG.2.10	And come away.
SNG.2.11	For lo, the winter is past,
SNG.2.11	The rain is over 
SNG.2.12	The flowers appear on the earth;
SNG.2.12	The time of singing has come,
SNG.2.12	And the voice of the turtledove
SNG.2.12	Is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	The fig tree puts forth her green figs,
SNG.2.13	And the vines 
SNG.2.13	Give a 
SNG.2.13	Rise up, my love, my fair one,
SNG.2.13	And come away!
SNG.2.14	“O my 
SNG.2.14	In the secret 
SNG.2.14	Let me see your face,
SNG.2.14	Let me hear your voice;
SNG.2.14	For your voice 
SNG.2.14	And your face 
SNG.2.15	Catch us 
SNG.2.15	The little foxes that spoil the vines,
SNG.2.15	For our vines 
SNG.2.16	My beloved 
SNG.2.16	He feeds 
SNG.2.17	Until the day breaks
SNG.2.17	And the shadows flee away,
SNG.2.17	Turn, my beloved,
SNG.2.17	And be 
SNG.2.17	Or a young stag
SNG.2.17	Upon the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	By 
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but I did not find him.
SNG.3.2	“I will rise now,” 
SNG.3.2	“And go about the city;
SNG.3.2	In the streets and in the squares
SNG.3.2	I will seek the one I love.”
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but I did not find him.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen who go about the city found me;
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen the one I love?”
SNG.3.4	Scarcely had I passed by them,
SNG.3.4	When I found the one I love.
SNG.3.4	I held him and would not let him go,
SNG.3.4	Until I had brought him to the 
SNG.3.4	And into the chamber of her who conceived me.
SNG.3.5	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	By the gazelles or by the does of the field,
SNG.3.5	Do not stir up nor awaken love
SNG.3.5	Until it pleases.
SNG.3.6	Who 
SNG.3.6	Like pillars of smoke,
SNG.3.6	Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
SNG.3.6	With all the merchant’s fragrant powders?
SNG.3.7	Behold, it 
SNG.3.7	 sixty valiant men around it,
SNG.3.7	Of the valiant of Israel.
SNG.3.8	They all hold swords,
SNG.3.8	 expert in war.
SNG.3.8	Every man 
SNG.3.8	Because of fear in the night.
SNG.3.9	Of the wood of Lebanon
SNG.3.9	Solomon the King
SNG.3.9	Made himself a palanquin:
SNG.3.10	He made its pillars 
SNG.3.10	Its support 
SNG.3.10	Its seat 
SNG.3.10	Its interior paved 
SNG.3.10	By the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O daughters of Zion,
SNG.3.11	And see King Solomon with the crown
SNG.3.11	With which his mother crowned him
SNG.3.11	On the day of his wedding,
SNG.3.11	The day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, 
SNG.4.1	Behold, you 
SNG.4.1	You 
SNG.4.1	Your hair 
SNG.4.1	Going down from Mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth 
SNG.4.2	Which have come up from the washing,
SNG.4.2	Every one of which bears twins,
SNG.4.2	And none 
SNG.4.3	Your lips 
SNG.4.3	And your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your temples behind your veil
SNG.4.3	 like a piece of pomegranate.
SNG.4.4	Your neck 
SNG.4.4	Built 
SNG.4.4	On which hang a thousand bucklers,
SNG.4.4	All shields of mighty men.
SNG.4.5	Your two breasts 
SNG.4.5	Twins of a gazelle,
SNG.4.5	Which feed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day breaks
SNG.4.6	And the shadows flee away,
SNG.4.6	I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	And to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	You 
SNG.4.7	And 
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, 
SNG.4.8	With me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Look from the top of Amana,
SNG.4.8	From the top of Senir 
SNG.4.8	From the lions’ dens,
SNG.4.8	From the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart,
SNG.4.9	My sister, 
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart
SNG.4.9	With one 
SNG.4.9	With one link of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	How fair is your love,
SNG.4.10	My sister, 
SNG.4.10	How much better than wine is your love,
SNG.4.10	And the scent of your perfumes
SNG.4.10	Than all spices!
SNG.4.11	Your lips, O 
SNG.4.11	Drip as the honeycomb;
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk 
SNG.4.11	And the fragrance of your garments
SNG.4.12	A garden enclosed
SNG.4.12	 my sister, 
SNG.4.12	A spring shut up,
SNG.4.12	A fountain sealed.
SNG.4.13	Your plants 
SNG.4.13	With pleasant fruits,
SNG.4.13	Fragrant henna with spikenard,
SNG.4.14	Spikenard and saffron,
SNG.4.14	Calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	With all trees of frankincense,
SNG.4.14	Myrrh and aloes,
SNG.4.14	With all the chief spices—
SNG.4.15	A fountain of gardens,
SNG.4.15	A well of 
SNG.4.15	And streams from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north 
SNG.4.16	And come, O south!
SNG.4.16	Blow upon my garden,
SNG.4.16	 its spices may flow out.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come to his garden
SNG.4.16	And eat its pleasant 
SNG.5.1	I 
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, O 
SNG.5.1	Drink, yes, drink deeply,
SNG.5.1	O beloved ones!
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart is awake;
SNG.5.2	He knocks, 
SNG.5.2	“Open for me, my sister, my love,
SNG.5.2	My dove, my perfect one;
SNG.5.2	For my head is covered with dew,
SNG.5.2	My locks with the drops of the night.”
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my robe;
SNG.5.3	How can I put it on 
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet;
SNG.5.3	How can I defile them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put his hand
SNG.5.4	By the latch 
SNG.5.4	And my heart yearned for him.
SNG.5.5	I arose to open for my beloved,
SNG.5.5	And my hands dripped 
SNG.5.5	My fingers with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	On the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	I opened for my beloved,
SNG.5.6	But my beloved had turned away 
SNG.5.6	My heart leaped up when he spoke.
SNG.5.6	I sought him, but I could not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he gave me no answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen who went about the city found me.
SNG.5.7	They struck me, they wounded me;
SNG.5.7	The keepers of the walls
SNG.5.7	Took my veil away from me.
SNG.5.8	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	If you find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	That you tell him I 
SNG.5.9	What 
SNG.5.9	More than 
SNG.5.9	O fairest among women?
SNG.5.9	What 
SNG.5.9	More than 
SNG.5.9	That you so charge us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved 
SNG.5.10	Chief among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head 
SNG.5.11	His locks 
SNG.5.11	 black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes 
SNG.5.12	By the rivers of waters,
SNG.5.12	Washed with milk,
SNG.5.12	 fitly set.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks 
SNG.5.13	Banks of scented herbs.
SNG.5.13	His lips 
SNG.5.13	Dripping liquid myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands 
SNG.5.14	Set with beryl.
SNG.5.14	His body 
SNG.5.14	Inlaid 
SNG.5.15	His legs 
SNG.5.15	Set on bases of fine gold.
SNG.5.15	His countenance 
SNG.5.15	Excellent as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth 
SNG.5.16	Yes, he 
SNG.5.16	This 
SNG.5.16	And this 
SNG.5.16	O daughters of Jerusalem!
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	O fairest among women?
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved turned aside,
SNG.6.1	That we may seek him with you?
SNG.6.2	My beloved has gone to his 
SNG.6.2	To the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	To feed 
SNG.6.2	And to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I 
SNG.6.3	And my beloved 
SNG.6.3	He feeds 
SNG.6.4	O my love, you 
SNG.6.4	Lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	Awesome as 
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away from me,
SNG.6.5	For they have overcome me.
SNG.6.5	Your hair 
SNG.6.5	Going down from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth 
SNG.6.6	Which have come up from the washing;
SNG.6.6	Every one bears twins,
SNG.6.6	And none 
SNG.6.7	Like a piece of pomegranate
SNG.6.7	 your temples behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens
SNG.6.8	And eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	And 
SNG.6.9	My dove, my 
SNG.6.9	Is the only one,
SNG.6.9	The only one of her mother,
SNG.6.9	The favorite of the one who bore her.
SNG.6.9	The daughters saw her
SNG.6.9	And called her blessed,
SNG.6.9	The queens and the concubines,
SNG.6.9	And they praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who is she who looks forth as the morning,
SNG.6.10	Fair as the moon,
SNG.6.10	Clear as the sun,
SNG.6.10	Awesome as 
SNG.6.11	I went down to the garden of nuts
SNG.6.11	To see the verdure of the valley,
SNG.6.11	To see whether the vine had budded
SNG.6.11	 the pomegranates had bloomed.
SNG.6.12	Before I was even aware,
SNG.6.12	My soul had made me
SNG.6.12	 the chariots of my noble people.
SNG.6.13	Return, return, O Shulamite;
SNG.6.13	Return, return, that we may look upon you!
SNG.6.13	What would you see in the Shulamite—
SNG.6.13	As it were, the dance of the two camps?
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
SNG.7.1	O prince’s daughter!
SNG.7.1	The curves of your thighs 
SNG.7.1	The work of the hands of a skillful workman.
SNG.7.2	Your navel 
SNG.7.2	It lacks no blended beverage.
SNG.7.2	Your waist 
SNG.7.2	Set about with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your two breasts 
SNG.7.3	Twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck 
SNG.7.4	Your eyes 
SNG.7.4	By the gate of Bath Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose 
SNG.7.4	Which looks toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head 
SNG.7.5	And the hair of your head 
SNG.7.5	A king 
SNG.7.6	How fair and how pleasant you are,
SNG.7.6	O love, with your delights!
SNG.7.7	This stature of yours is like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	And your breasts 
SNG.7.8	I said, “I will go up to the palm tree,
SNG.7.8	I will take hold of its branches.”
SNG.7.8	Let now your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
SNG.7.8	The fragrance of your breath like apples,
SNG.7.9	And the roof of your mouth like the best wine.
SNG.7.9	Moving gently the lips of sleepers.
SNG.7.10	I 
SNG.7.10	And 
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved,
SNG.7.11	Let us go forth to the field;
SNG.7.11	Let us lodge in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us get up early to the vineyards;
SNG.7.12	Let us 
SNG.7.12	 the grape blossoms are open,
SNG.7.12	 the pomegranates are in bloom.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The 
SNG.7.13	And at our gates 
SNG.7.13	All manner, new and old,
SNG.7.13	Which I have laid up for you, my beloved.
SNG.8.1	Oh, that you were like my brother,
SNG.8.1	Who nursed at my mother’s breasts!
SNG.8.1	 I should find you outside,
SNG.8.1	I would kiss you;
SNG.8.1	I would not be despised.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you 
SNG.8.2	Into the 
SNG.8.2	She 
SNG.8.2	I would cause you to drink of 
SNG.8.2	Of the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	His left hand 
SNG.8.3	And his right hand embraces me.
SNG.8.4	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	Do not stir up nor awaken love
SNG.8.4	Until it pleases.
SNG.8.5	Who 
SNG.8.5	Leaning upon her beloved?
SNG.8.5	I awakened you under the apple tree.
SNG.8.5	There your mother brought you forth;
SNG.8.5	There she 
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon your heart,
SNG.8.6	As a seal upon your arm;
SNG.8.6	For love 
SNG.8.6	Jealousy 
SNG.8.6	Its flames 
SNG.8.6	A most vehement flame.
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	Nor can the floods drown it.
SNG.8.7	If a man would give for love
SNG.8.7	All the wealth of his house,
SNG.8.7	It would be utterly despised.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	And she has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	In the day when she is spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she 
SNG.8.9	We will build upon her
SNG.8.9	A battlement of silver;
SNG.8.9	And if she 
SNG.8.9	We will enclose her
SNG.8.9	With boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I 
SNG.8.10	And my breasts like towers;
SNG.8.10	Then I became in his eyes
SNG.8.10	As one who found peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon;
SNG.8.11	He leased the vineyard to keepers;
SNG.8.11	Everyone was to bring for its fruit
SNG.8.11	A thousand silver 
SNG.8.12	My own vineyard 
SNG.8.12	You, O Solomon, 
SNG.8.12	And those who tend its fruit two hundred.
SNG.8.13	You who dwell in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	The companions listen for your voice—
SNG.8.13	Let me hear it!
SNG.8.14	Make haste, my beloved,
SNG.8.14	And 
SNG.8.14	Or a young stag
SNG.8.14	On the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	The 
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth!
ISA.1.2	For the 
ISA.1.2	“I have nourished and brought up children,
ISA.1.2	And they have rebelled against Me;
ISA.1.3	The ox knows its owner
ISA.1.3	And the donkey its master’s crib;
ISA.1.3	 Israel 
ISA.1.3	My people do not consider.”
ISA.1.4	Alas, sinful nation,
ISA.1.4	A people laden with iniquity,
ISA.1.4	A brood of evildoers,
ISA.1.4	Children who are corrupters!
ISA.1.4	They have forsaken the 
ISA.1.4	They have provoked to anger
ISA.1.4	The Holy One of Israel,
ISA.1.4	They have turned away backward.
ISA.1.5	Why should you be stricken again?
ISA.1.5	You will revolt more and more.
ISA.1.5	The whole head is sick,
ISA.1.5	And the whole heart faints.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even to the head,
ISA.1.6	 wounds and bruises and putrefying sores;
ISA.1.6	They have not been closed or bound up,
ISA.1.6	Or soothed with ointment.
ISA.1.7	Your country 
ISA.1.7	Your cities 
ISA.1.7	Strangers devour your land in your presence;
ISA.1.7	And 
ISA.1.8	So the daughter of Zion is left 
ISA.1.8	As a hut in a garden of cucumbers,
ISA.1.8	As a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	Unless the 
ISA.1.9	Had left to us a very small remnant,
ISA.1.9	We would have become like 
ISA.1.9	We would have been made like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.10	You rulers 
ISA.1.10	Give ear to the law of our God,
ISA.1.10	You people of Gomorrah:
ISA.1.11	“To what purpose 
ISA.1.11	Says the 
ISA.1.11	“I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams
ISA.1.11	And the fat of fed cattle.
ISA.1.11	I do not delight in the blood of bulls,
ISA.1.11	Or of lambs or goats.
ISA.1.12	“When you come 
ISA.1.12	Who has required this from your hand,
ISA.1.12	To trample My courts?
ISA.1.13	Bring no more 
ISA.1.13	Incense is an abomination to Me.
ISA.1.13	The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and 
ISA.1.13	I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting.
ISA.1.14	Your 
ISA.1.14	My soul hates;
ISA.1.14	They are a trouble to Me,
ISA.1.14	I am weary of bearing 
ISA.1.15	When you spread out your hands,
ISA.1.15	I will hide My eyes from you;
ISA.1.15	Even though you make many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not hear.
ISA.1.15	Your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	“Wash
ISA.1.16	Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes.
ISA.1.16	Cease to do evil,
ISA.1.17	Learn to do good;
ISA.1.17	Seek justice,
ISA.1.17	Rebuke the oppressor;
ISA.1.17	Defend the fatherless,
ISA.1.17	Plead for the widow.
ISA.1.18	“Come now, and let us 
ISA.1.18	Says the 
ISA.1.18	“Though your sins are like scarlet,
ISA.1.18	They shall be as white as snow;
ISA.1.18	Though they are red like crimson,
ISA.1.18	They shall be as wool.
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obedient,
ISA.1.19	You shall eat the good of the land;
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse and rebel,
ISA.1.20	You shall be devoured by the sword”;
ISA.1.20	For the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	How the faithful city has become a harlot!
ISA.1.21	It was full of justice;
ISA.1.21	Righteousness lodged in it,
ISA.1.21	But now 
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross,
ISA.1.22	Your wine mixed with water.
ISA.1.23	Your princes 
ISA.1.23	And 
ISA.1.23	Everyone loves bribes,
ISA.1.23	And follows after rewards.
ISA.1.23	They 
ISA.1.23	Nor does the cause of the widow come before them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord says,
ISA.1.24	The 
ISA.1.24	“Ah, 
ISA.1.24	And take vengeance on My enemies.
ISA.1.25	I will turn My hand against you,
ISA.1.25	And 
ISA.1.25	And take away all your alloy.
ISA.1.26	I will restore your judges 
ISA.1.26	And your counselors as at the beginning.
ISA.1.26	Afterward 
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed with justice,
ISA.1.27	And her penitents with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	The 
ISA.1.28	And those who forsake the 
ISA.1.29	For they shall be ashamed of the terebinth trees
ISA.1.29	Which you have desired;
ISA.1.29	And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens
ISA.1.29	Which you have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades,
ISA.1.30	And as a garden that has no water.
ISA.1.31	The strong shall be as tinder,
ISA.1.31	And the work of it as a spark;
ISA.1.31	Both will burn together,
ISA.1.31	And no one shall 
ISA.2.1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	Now 
ISA.2.2	 the mountain of the 
ISA.2.2	Shall be established on the top of the mountains,
ISA.2.2	And shall be exalted above the hills;
ISA.2.2	And all nations shall flow to it.
ISA.2.3	Many people shall come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	To the house of the God of Jacob;
ISA.2.3	He will teach us His ways,
ISA.2.3	And we shall walk in His paths.”
ISA.2.3	For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
ISA.2.3	And the word of the 
ISA.2.4	He shall judge between the nations,
ISA.2.4	And rebuke many people;
ISA.2.4	They shall beat their swords into plowshares,
ISA.2.4	And their spears into pruning hooks;
ISA.2.4	Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	Neither shall they learn war anymore.
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob, come and let us 
ISA.2.5	In the light of the 
ISA.2.6	For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	Because they are filled 
ISA.2.6	They 
ISA.2.6	And they are pleased with the children of foreigners.
ISA.2.7	Their land is also full of silver and gold,
ISA.2.7	And there is no end to their treasures;
ISA.2.7	Their land is also full of horses,
ISA.2.7	And there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land is also full of idols;
ISA.2.8	They worship the work of their own hands,
ISA.2.8	That which their own fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	People bow down,
ISA.2.9	And each man humbles himself;
ISA.2.9	Therefore do not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust,
ISA.2.10	From the terror of the 
ISA.2.10	And the glory of His majesty.
ISA.2.11	The lofty looks of man shall be 
ISA.2.11	The haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,
ISA.2.11	And the 
ISA.2.12	For the day of the 
ISA.2.12	Upon everything lifted up—
ISA.2.12	And it shall be brought low—
ISA.2.13	Upon all 
ISA.2.13	And upon all the oaks of Bashan;
ISA.2.14	Upon all the high mountains,
ISA.2.14	And upon all the hills 
ISA.2.15	Upon every high tower,
ISA.2.15	And upon every fortified wall;
ISA.2.16	Upon all the ships of Tarshish,
ISA.2.16	And upon all the beautiful sloops.
ISA.2.17	The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
ISA.2.17	And the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;
ISA.2.17	The 
ISA.2.18	But the idols He shall utterly abolish.
ISA.2.19	They shall go into the 
ISA.2.19	And into the caves of the earth,
ISA.2.19	From the terror of the 
ISA.2.19	And the glory of His majesty,
ISA.2.19	When He arises 
ISA.2.20	In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver
ISA.2.20	And his idols of gold,
ISA.2.20	Which they made, 
ISA.2.20	To the moles and bats,
ISA.2.21	To go into the clefts of the rocks,
ISA.2.21	And into the crags of the rugged rocks,
ISA.2.21	From the terror of the 
ISA.2.21	And the glory of His majesty,
ISA.2.21	When He arises to shake the earth mightily.
ISA.2.22	Sever yourselves from such a man,
ISA.2.22	Whose 
ISA.2.22	For of what account is he?
ISA.3.1	For behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.3.1	Takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah
ISA.3.1	The stock and the store,
ISA.3.1	The whole supply of bread and the whole supply of water;
ISA.3.2	The mighty man and the man of war,
ISA.3.2	The judge and the prophet,
ISA.3.2	And the diviner and the elder;
ISA.3.3	The captain of fifty and the honorable man,
ISA.3.3	The counselor and the skillful artisan,
ISA.3.3	And the expert enchanter.
ISA.3.4	“I will give 
ISA.3.4	And babes shall rule over them.
ISA.3.5	The people will be oppressed,
ISA.3.5	Every one by another and every one by his neighbor;
ISA.3.5	The child will be insolent toward the elder,
ISA.3.5	And the base toward the honorable.”
ISA.3.6	When a man takes hold of his brother
ISA.3.6	In the house of his father, 
ISA.3.6	“You have clothing;
ISA.3.6	You be our ruler,
ISA.3.6	And 
ISA.3.7	In that day he will protest, saying,
ISA.3.7	“I cannot cure 
ISA.3.7	For in my house 
ISA.3.7	Do not make me a ruler of the people.”
ISA.3.8	For 
ISA.3.8	And Judah is fallen,
ISA.3.8	Because their tongue and their doings
ISA.3.8	 against the 
ISA.3.8	To provoke the eyes of His glory.
ISA.3.9	The look on their countenance witnesses against them,
ISA.3.9	And they declare their sin as 
ISA.3.9	They do not hide 
ISA.3.9	Woe to their soul!
ISA.3.9	For they have brought evil upon themselves.
ISA.3.10	“Say to the righteous 
ISA.3.10	For they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked! 
ISA.3.11	For the reward of his hands shall be given him.
ISA.3.12	And women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	O My people! 
ISA.3.12	And destroy the way of your paths.”
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	And stands to judge the people.
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.14	With the elders of His people
ISA.3.14	And His princes:
ISA.3.14	“For you have eaten up 
ISA.3.14	The plunder of the poor 
ISA.3.15	What do you mean by 
ISA.3.15	And grinding the faces of the poor?”
ISA.3.15	Says the Lord 
ISA.3.16	Moreover the 
ISA.3.16	“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
ISA.3.16	And walk with outstretched necks
ISA.3.16	And wanton eyes,
ISA.3.16	Walking and mincing 
ISA.3.16	Making a jingling with their feet,
ISA.3.17	Therefore the Lord will strike with 
ISA.3.17	The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,
ISA.3.17	And the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the finery:
ISA.3.18	The jingling anklets, the scarves, and the 
ISA.3.19	The pendants, the bracelets, and the veils;
ISA.3.20	The headdresses, the leg ornaments, and the headbands;
ISA.3.20	The perfume boxes, the charms,
ISA.3.21	and the rings;
ISA.3.21	The nose jewels,
ISA.3.22	the festal apparel, and the mantles;
ISA.3.22	The outer garments, the purses,
ISA.3.23	and the mirrors;
ISA.3.23	The fine linen, the turbans, and the robes.
ISA.3.24	And so it shall be:
ISA.3.24	Instead of a sweet smell there will be a stench;
ISA.3.24	Instead of a sash, a rope;
ISA.3.24	Instead of well-set hair, 
ISA.3.24	Instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	And branding instead of beauty.
ISA.3.25	Your men shall fall by the sword,
ISA.3.25	And your mighty in the war.
ISA.3.26	Her gates shall lament and mourn,
ISA.3.26	And she 
ISA.4.1	And 
ISA.4.1	“We will 
ISA.4.1	Only let us be called by your name,
ISA.4.1	To take away 
ISA.4.2	In that day 
ISA.4.2	And the fruit of the earth 
ISA.4.2	For those of Israel who have escaped.
ISA.4.3	And it shall come to pass that 
ISA.4.4	When 
ISA.4.5	then the 
ISA.4.6	And there will be a tabernacle for shade in the daytime from the heat, 
ISA.5.1	Now let me sing to my Well-beloved
ISA.5.1	A song of my Beloved 
ISA.5.1	My Well-beloved has a vineyard
ISA.5.1	On a very fruitful hill.
ISA.5.2	He dug it up and cleared out its stones,
ISA.5.2	And planted it with the choicest vine.
ISA.5.2	He built a tower in its midst,
ISA.5.2	And also made a winepress in it;
ISA.5.2	So He expected 
ISA.5.2	But it brought forth wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	“And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
ISA.5.3	Judge, please, between Me and My vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more could have been done to My vineyard
ISA.5.4	That I have not done in 
ISA.5.4	Why then, when I expected 
ISA.5.4	Did it bring forth wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	And now, please let Me tell you what I will do to My vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will take away its hedge, and it shall be burned;
ISA.5.5	 break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.
ISA.5.6	I will lay it 
ISA.5.6	It shall not be pruned or dug,
ISA.5.6	But there shall come up briers and 
ISA.5.6	I will also command the clouds
ISA.5.6	That they rain no rain on it.”
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	And the men of Judah are His pleasant plant.
ISA.5.7	He looked for justice, but behold, oppression;
ISA.5.7	For righteousness, but behold, a cry 
ISA.5.8	Woe to those who join 
ISA.5.8	They add field to field,
ISA.5.8	Till 
ISA.5.8	Where they may dwell alone in the midst of the land!
ISA.5.9	In my hearing the 
ISA.5.9	“Truly, many houses shall be desolate,
ISA.5.9	Great and beautiful ones, without inhabitant.
ISA.5.10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one 
ISA.5.10	And a homer of seed shall yield one ephah.”
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning,
ISA.5.11	 they may follow intoxicating drink;
ISA.5.11	Who continue until night, 
ISA.5.12	The harp and the strings,
ISA.5.12	The tambourine and flute,
ISA.5.12	And wine are in their feasts;
ISA.5.12	But 
ISA.5.12	Nor consider the operation of His hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people have gone into captivity,
ISA.5.13	Because 
ISA.5.13	Their honorable men 
ISA.5.13	And their multitude dried up with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself
ISA.5.14	And opened its mouth beyond measure;
ISA.5.14	Their glory and their multitude and their pomp,
ISA.5.14	And he who is jubilant, shall descend into it.
ISA.5.15	People shall be brought down,
ISA.5.15	Each man shall be humbled,
ISA.5.15	And the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled.
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.16	And God who is holy shall be hallowed in righteousness.
ISA.5.17	Then the lambs shall feed in their pasture,
ISA.5.17	And in the waste places of 
ISA.5.18	Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
ISA.5.18	And sin as if with a cart rope;
ISA.5.19	That say, “Let Him make speed 
ISA.5.19	That we may see 
ISA.5.19	And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,
ISA.5.19	That we may know 
ISA.5.20	Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
ISA.5.20	Who put darkness for light, and light for darkness;
ISA.5.20	Who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe to 
ISA.5.21	And prudent in their own sight!
ISA.5.22	Woe to men mighty at drinking wine,
ISA.5.22	Woe to men valiant for mixing intoxicating drink,
ISA.5.23	Who 
ISA.5.23	And take away justice from the righteous man!
ISA.5.24	Therefore, 
ISA.5.24	And the flame consumes the chaff,
ISA.5.24	And their blossom will ascend like dust;
ISA.5.24	Because they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.24	And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	Therefore the anger of the 
ISA.5.25	He has stretched out His hand against them
ISA.5.25	And stricken them,
ISA.5.25	And 
ISA.5.25	Their carcasses 
ISA.5.25	For all this His anger is not turned away,
ISA.5.25	But His hand 
ISA.5.26	He will lift up a banner to the nations from afar,
ISA.5.26	And will 
ISA.5.26	Surely 
ISA.5.27	No one will be weary or stumble among them,
ISA.5.27	No one will slumber or sleep;
ISA.5.27	Nor 
ISA.5.27	Nor the strap of their sandals be broken;
ISA.5.28	Whose arrows 
ISA.5.28	And all their bows bent;
ISA.5.28	Their horses’ hooves will seem like flint,
ISA.5.28	And their wheels like a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	Their roaring 
ISA.5.29	They will roar like young lions;
ISA.5.29	Yes, they will roar
ISA.5.29	And lay hold of the prey;
ISA.5.29	They will carry 
ISA.5.29	And no one will deliver.
ISA.5.30	In that day they will roar against them
ISA.5.30	Like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	And if 
ISA.5.30	Behold, darkness 
ISA.5.30	And the light is darkened by the clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year that 
ISA.6.2	Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, 
ISA.6.3	And one cried to another and said:
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy 
ISA.6.3	The whole earth 
ISA.6.4	And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	So I said:
ISA.6.5	“Woe 
ISA.6.5	Because I 
ISA.6.5	And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;
ISA.6.5	For my eyes have seen the King,
ISA.6.5	The 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal 
ISA.6.7	And he 
ISA.6.7	“Behold, this has touched your lips;
ISA.6.7	Your iniquity is taken away,
ISA.6.7	And your sin purged.”
ISA.6.8	Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:
ISA.6.8	“Whom shall I send,
ISA.6.8	And who will go for 
ISA.6.8	Then I said, “Here 
ISA.6.9	And He said, “Go, and 
ISA.6.9	‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;
ISA.6.9	Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’
ISA.6.10	“Make 
ISA.6.10	And their ears heavy,
ISA.6.10	And shut their eyes;
ISA.6.10	Lest they see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	And hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	And understand with their heart,
ISA.6.10	And return and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Lord, how long?”
ISA.6.11	And He answered:
ISA.6.11	“Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant,
ISA.6.11	The houses are without a man,
ISA.6.11	The land is utterly desolate,
ISA.6.12	The 
ISA.6.12	And the forsaken places 
ISA.6.13	But yet a tenth 
ISA.6.13	And will return and be for consuming,
ISA.6.13	As a terebinth tree or as an oak,
ISA.6.13	Whose stump 
ISA.6.13	So 
ISA.7.1	Now it came to pass in the days of 
ISA.7.2	And it was told to the house of David, saying, “Syria’s forces are deployed in Ephraim.” So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.4	and say to him: ‘Take heed, and be 
ISA.7.5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and let us make a gap in its wall for ourselves, and set a king over them, the son of Tabel”—
ISA.7.7	thus says the Lord 
ISA.7.7	“It shall not stand,
ISA.7.7	Nor shall it come to pass.
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria 
ISA.7.8	And the head of Damascus 
ISA.7.8	Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken,
ISA.7.9	The head of Ephraim 
ISA.7.9	And the head of Samaria 
ISA.7.9	If you will not believe,
ISA.7.9	Surely you shall not be established.” ’ ”
ISA.7.10	Moreover the 
ISA.7.11	“Ask a sign for yourself from the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I test the 
ISA.7.13	Then he said, “Hear now, O house of David! 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: 
ISA.7.15	Curds and honey He shall eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you dread will be forsaken by 
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	And it shall come to pass in that day
ISA.7.18	 the 
ISA.7.18	That 
ISA.7.18	And for the bee that 
ISA.7.19	They will come, and all of them will rest
ISA.7.19	In the desolate valleys and in 
ISA.7.19	And on all thorns and in all pastures.
ISA.7.20	In the same day the Lord will shave with a 
ISA.7.20	With those from beyond the River, with the king of Assyria,
ISA.7.20	The head and the hair of the legs,
ISA.7.20	And will also remove the beard.
ISA.7.21	It shall be in that day
ISA.7.21	 a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep;
ISA.7.22	So it shall be, from the abundance of milk they give,
ISA.7.22	That he will eat curds;
ISA.7.22	For curds and honey everyone will eat who is left in the land.
ISA.7.23	It shall happen in that day,
ISA.7.23	 wherever there could be a thousand vines
ISA.7.23	 a thousand 
ISA.7.23	It will be for briers and thorns.
ISA.7.24	With arrows and bows 
ISA.7.24	Because all the land will become briers and thorns.
ISA.7.25	And to any hill which could be dug with the hoe,
ISA.7.25	You will not go there for fear of briers and thorns;
ISA.7.25	But it will become a range for oxen
ISA.7.25	And a place for sheep to roam.
ISA.8.1	Moreover the 
ISA.8.2	And I will take for Myself faithful witnesses to record, 
ISA.8.3	Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the 
ISA.8.4	for before the child shall have knowledge to cry ‘My father’ and ‘My mother,’ 
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	“Inasmuch as these people refused
ISA.8.6	The waters of 
ISA.8.6	And rejoice 
ISA.8.7	Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up over them
ISA.8.7	The waters of the River, strong and mighty—
ISA.8.7	The king of Assyria and all his glory;
ISA.8.7	He will go up over all his channels
ISA.8.7	And go over all his banks.
ISA.8.8	He will pass through Judah,
ISA.8.8	He will overflow and pass over,
ISA.8.8	He will reach up to the neck;
ISA.8.8	And the stretching out of his wings
ISA.8.8	Will fill the breadth of Your land, O 
ISA.8.9	“Be

ISA.8.9	Gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces;
ISA.8.9	Gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces.
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing;
ISA.8.10	Speak the word, 
ISA.8.10	For God 
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	“Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’
ISA.8.12	Concerning all that this people call a conspiracy,
ISA.8.12	Nor be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.
ISA.8.13	The 
ISA.8.13	 Him 
ISA.8.13	And 
ISA.8.14	He will be as a sanctuary,
ISA.8.14	But 
ISA.8.14	To both the houses of Israel,
ISA.8.14	As a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	And many among them shall 
ISA.8.15	They shall fall and be broken,
ISA.8.15	Be snared and taken.”
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony,
ISA.8.16	Seal the law among my disciples.
ISA.8.17	And I will wait on the 
ISA.8.17	Who 
ISA.8.17	And I 
ISA.8.18	Here am I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.18	From the 
ISA.8.18	Who dwells in Mount Zion.
ISA.8.19	And when they say to you, 
ISA.8.20	To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, 
ISA.8.21	They will pass through it hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall happen, when they are hungry, that they will be enraged and 
ISA.8.22	Then they will look to the earth, and see trouble and darkness, gloom of anguish; and 
ISA.9.1	Nevertheless 
ISA.9.1	As when at 
ISA.9.1	The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
ISA.9.1	And 
ISA.9.1	 the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
ISA.9.1	In Galilee of the Gentiles.
ISA.9.2	The people who walked in darkness
ISA.9.2	Have seen a great light;
ISA.9.2	Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death,
ISA.9.2	Upon them a light has shined.
ISA.9.3	You have multiplied the nation
ISA.9.3	 increased its joy;
ISA.9.3	They rejoice before You
ISA.9.3	According to the joy of harvest,
ISA.9.3	As 
ISA.9.4	For You have broken the yoke of his burden
ISA.9.4	And the staff of his shoulder,
ISA.9.4	The rod of his oppressor,
ISA.9.4	As in the day of 
ISA.9.5	For every warrior’s sandal from the noisy battle,
ISA.9.5	And garments rolled in blood,
ISA.9.5	Will be used for burning 
ISA.9.6	For unto us a Child is born,
ISA.9.6	Unto us a 
ISA.9.6	And 
ISA.9.6	And His name will be called
ISA.9.6	Wonderful, Counselor, 
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father, 
ISA.9.7	Of the increase of 
ISA.9.7	Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom,
ISA.9.7	To order it and establish it with judgment and justice
ISA.9.7	From that time forward, even forever.
ISA.9.7	The 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word against 
ISA.9.8	And it has fallen on Israel.
ISA.9.9	All the people will know—
ISA.9.9	Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria—
ISA.9.9	Who say in pride and arrogance of heart:
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen down,
ISA.9.10	But we will rebuild with hewn stones;
ISA.9.10	The sycamores are cut down,
ISA.9.10	But we will replace 
ISA.9.11	Therefore the 
ISA.9.11	The adversaries of Rezin against him,
ISA.9.11	And spur his enemies on,
ISA.9.12	The Syrians before and the Philistines behind;
ISA.9.12	And they shall devour Israel with an open mouth.
ISA.9.12	For all this His anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.12	But His hand 
ISA.9.13	For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them,
ISA.9.13	Nor do they seek the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore the 
ISA.9.14	Palm branch and bulrush 
ISA.9.15	The elder and honorable, he 
ISA.9.15	The prophet who teaches lies, he 
ISA.9.16	For 
ISA.9.16	And 
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord 
ISA.9.17	Nor have mercy on their fatherless and widows;
ISA.9.17	For everyone 
ISA.9.17	And every mouth speaks folly.
ISA.9.17	For all this His anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.17	But His hand 
ISA.9.18	For wickedness 
ISA.9.18	It shall devour the briers and thorns,
ISA.9.18	And kindle in the thickets of the forest;
ISA.9.18	They shall mount up 
ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the 
ISA.9.19	The land is burned up,
ISA.9.19	And the people shall be as fuel for the fire;
ISA.9.19	No man shall spare his brother.
ISA.9.20	And he shall snatch on the right hand
ISA.9.20	And be hungry;
ISA.9.20	He shall devour on the left hand
ISA.9.20	And not be satisfied;
ISA.9.20	Every man shall eat the flesh of his own arm.
ISA.9.21	Manasseh 
ISA.9.21	Together they 
ISA.9.21	For all this His anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.21	But His hand 
ISA.10.1	“Woe to those who 
ISA.10.1	Who write misfortune,
ISA.10.1	 they have prescribed
ISA.10.2	To rob the needy of justice,
ISA.10.2	And to take what is right from the poor of My people,
ISA.10.2	That widows may be their prey,
ISA.10.2	And 
ISA.10.3	What will you do in 
ISA.10.3	And in the desolation 
ISA.10.3	To whom will you flee for help?
ISA.10.3	And where will you leave your glory?
ISA.10.4	Without Me they shall bow down among the 
ISA.10.4	And they shall fall among the slain.”
ISA.10.4	For all this His anger is not turned away,
ISA.10.4	But His hand 
ISA.10.5	“Woe to Assyria, 
ISA.10.5	And the staff in whose hand is My indignation.
ISA.10.6	I will send him against 
ISA.10.6	And against the people of My wrath
ISA.10.6	I will 
ISA.10.6	To seize the spoil, to take the prey,
ISA.10.6	And to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
ISA.10.7	Yet he does not mean so,
ISA.10.7	Nor does his heart think so;
ISA.10.7	But 
ISA.10.7	And cut off not a few nations.
ISA.10.8	For he says,
ISA.10.8	‘
ISA.10.9	 not 
ISA.10.9	 not Hamath like Arpad?
ISA.10.9	 not Samaria 
ISA.10.10	As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols,
ISA.10.10	Whose carved images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
ISA.10.11	As I have done to Samaria and her idols,
ISA.10.11	Shall I not do also to Jerusalem and her idols?’ ”
ISA.10.12	Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Lord has performed all His work 
ISA.10.13	For he says:
ISA.10.13	“By the strength of my hand I have done 
ISA.10.13	And by my wisdom, for I am prudent;
ISA.10.13	Also I have removed the boundaries of the people,
ISA.10.13	And have robbed their treasuries;
ISA.10.13	So I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant 
ISA.10.14	My hand has found like a nest the riches of the people,
ISA.10.14	And as one gathers eggs 
ISA.10.14	I have gathered all the earth;
ISA.10.14	And there was no one who moved 
ISA.10.14	Nor opened 
ISA.10.15	Shall 
ISA.10.15	 shall the saw exalt itself against him who saws with it?
ISA.10.15	As if a rod could wield 
ISA.10.15	 as if a staff could lift up, 
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
ISA.10.16	Will send leanness among his fat ones;
ISA.10.16	And under his glory
ISA.10.16	He will kindle a burning
ISA.10.16	Like the burning of a fire.
ISA.10.17	So the Light of Israel will be for a fire,
ISA.10.17	And his Holy One for a flame;
ISA.10.17	It will burn and devour
ISA.10.17	His thorns and his briers in one day.
ISA.10.18	And it will consume the glory of his forest and of 
ISA.10.18	Both soul and body;
ISA.10.18	And they will be as when a sick man wastes away.
ISA.10.19	Then the rest of the trees of his forest
ISA.10.19	Will be so few in number
ISA.10.19	That a child may write them.
ISA.10.20	And it shall come to pass in that day
ISA.10.20	 the remnant of Israel,
ISA.10.20	And such as have escaped of the house of Jacob,
ISA.10.20	Will never again depend on him who defeated them,
ISA.10.20	But will depend on the 
ISA.10.21	The remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob,
ISA.10.21	To the 
ISA.10.22	For though your people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea,
ISA.10.22	A remnant of them will return;
ISA.10.22	The destruction decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
ISA.10.23	For the Lord 
ISA.10.23	Will make a determined end
ISA.10.23	In the midst of all the land.
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus says the Lord 
ISA.10.25	For yet a very little while 
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	It shall come to pass in that day
ISA.10.27	 his burden will be taken away from your shoulder,
ISA.10.27	And his yoke from your neck,
ISA.10.27	And the yoke will be destroyed because of 
ISA.10.28	He has come to Aiath,
ISA.10.28	He has passed Migron;
ISA.10.28	At Michmash he has attended to his equipment.
ISA.10.29	They have gone along 
ISA.10.29	They have taken up lodging at Geba.
ISA.10.29	Ramah is afraid,
ISA.10.29	Gibeah of Saul has fled.
ISA.10.30	Lift up your voice,
ISA.10.30	O daughter 
ISA.10.30	Cause it to be heard as far as 
ISA.10.30	O poor Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	Madmenah has fled,
ISA.10.31	The inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.
ISA.10.32	As yet he will remain 
ISA.10.32	He will 
ISA.10.32	The hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord,
ISA.10.33	The 
ISA.10.33	Will lop off the bough with terror;
ISA.10.33	Those of high stature 
ISA.10.33	And the haughty will be humbled.
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
ISA.10.34	And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	There 
ISA.11.1	And 
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of counsel and might,
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	His delight 
ISA.11.3	And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes,
ISA.11.3	Nor decide by the hearing of His ears;
ISA.11.4	But 
ISA.11.4	And decide with equity for the meek of the earth;
ISA.11.4	He shall 
ISA.11.4	And with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	Righteousness shall be the belt of His loins,
ISA.11.5	And faithfulness the belt of His waist.
ISA.11.6	“The
ISA.11.6	The leopard shall lie down with the young goat,
ISA.11.6	The calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
ISA.11.6	And a little child shall lead them.
ISA.11.7	The cow and the bear shall graze;
ISA.11.7	Their young ones shall lie down together;
ISA.11.7	And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	The nursing child shall play by the cobra’s hole,
ISA.11.8	And the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper’s den.
ISA.11.9	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	For 
ISA.11.9	As the waters cover the sea.
ISA.11.10	“And
ISA.11.10	Who shall stand as a 
ISA.11.10	For the 
ISA.11.10	And His resting place shall be glorious.”
ISA.11.11	It shall come to pass in that day
ISA.11.11	 the Lord shall set His hand again the second time
ISA.11.11	To recover the remnant of His people who are left,
ISA.11.11	From Assyria and Egypt,
ISA.11.11	From Pathros and Cush,
ISA.11.11	From Elam and Shinar,
ISA.11.11	From Hamath and the islands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	He will set up a banner for the nations,
ISA.11.12	And will assemble the outcasts of Israel,
ISA.11.12	And gather together 
ISA.11.12	From the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	Also 
ISA.11.13	And the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off;
ISA.11.13	Ephraim shall not envy Judah,
ISA.11.13	And Judah shall not harass Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	But they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines toward the west;
ISA.11.14	Together they shall plunder the people of the East;
ISA.11.14	They shall lay their hand on Edom and Moab;
ISA.11.14	And the people of Ammon shall obey them.
ISA.11.15	The 
ISA.11.15	With His mighty wind He will shake His fist over the River,
ISA.11.15	And strike it in the seven streams,
ISA.11.15	And make 
ISA.11.16	There will be a highway for the remnant of His people
ISA.11.16	Who will be left from Assyria,
ISA.11.16	As it was for Israel
ISA.11.16	In the day that he came up from the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	And 
ISA.12.1	“O 
ISA.12.1	Though You were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.
ISA.12.2	Behold, God 
ISA.12.2	I will trust and not be afraid;
ISA.12.2	‘For 
ISA.12.2	He also has become my salvation.’ ”
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy you will draw 
ISA.12.3	From the wells of salvation.
ISA.12.4	And in that day you will say:
ISA.12.4	“Praise the 
ISA.12.4	Declare His deeds among the peoples,
ISA.12.4	Make mention that His 
ISA.12.5	Sing to the 
ISA.12.5	For He has done excellent things;

ISA.13.3	Those who

ISA.13.5	The 
ISA.13.5	To destroy the whole 
ISA.13.6	Wail, 
ISA.13.6	It will come as destruction from the Almighty.
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands will be limp,
ISA.13.7	Every man’s heart will melt,
ISA.13.8	And they will be afraid.
ISA.13.8	Pangs and sorrows will take hold of

ISA.13.12	A man more than the golden wedge of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will shake the heavens,
ISA.13.13	And the earth will move out of her place,

ISA.13.13	And in 
ISA.13.14	It shall be as the hunted gazelle,

ISA.14.24	“Surely, as I have thought, so it shall come to pass,
ISA.14.24	And as I have purposed, 
ISA.14.25	That I will break the 
ISA.14.25	And on My mountains tread him underfoot.
ISA.14.25	Then 
ISA.14.25	And his burden removed from their shoulders.
ISA.14.26	This 
ISA.14.26	And this 
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.27	And who will annul 
ISA.14.27	His hand 
ISA.14.27	And who will turn it back?”
ISA.14.28	This is the burden which came in the year that 
ISA.14.29	“Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia,
ISA.14.29	Because the rod that struck you is broken;
ISA.14.29	For out of the serpent’s roots will come forth a viper,
ISA.14.29	And its offspring 
ISA.14.30	The firstborn of the poor will feed,
ISA.14.30	And the needy will lie down in safety;
ISA.14.30	I will kill your roots with famine,
ISA.14.30	And it will slay your remnant.
ISA.14.31	Wail, O gate! Cry, O city!
ISA.14.31	All you of Philistia 
ISA.14.31	For smoke will come from the north,
ISA.14.31	And no one 
ISA.14.32	What will they answer the messengers of the nation?
ISA.14.32	That 
ISA.14.32	And 
ISA.15.1	The 
ISA.15.1	Because in the night 
ISA.15.1	 destroyed,
ISA.15.1	Because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste
ISA.15.1	 destroyed,
ISA.15.2	He has gone up to the temple and Dibon,
ISA.15.2	To the high places to weep.
ISA.15.2	Moab will wail over Nebo and over Medeba;
ISA.15.2	On all their heads 
ISA.15.2	 every beard cut off.
ISA.15.3	In their streets they will clothe themselves with sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	On the tops of their houses
ISA.15.3	And in their streets
ISA.15.3	Everyone will wail, 
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out,
ISA.15.4	Their voice shall be heard as far as 
ISA.15.4	Therefore the armed soldiers of Moab will cry out;
ISA.15.4	His life will be burdensome to him.
ISA.15.5	“My
ISA.15.5	His fugitives 
ISA.15.5	 a three-year-old heifer.
ISA.15.5	For 
ISA.15.5	They will go up with weeping;
ISA.15.5	For in the way of Horonaim
ISA.15.5	They will raise up a cry of destruction,
ISA.15.6	For the waters 
ISA.15.6	For the green grass has withered away;
ISA.15.6	The grass fails, there is nothing green.
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they have gained,
ISA.15.7	And what they have laid up,
ISA.15.7	They will carry away to the Brook of the Willows.
ISA.15.8	For the cry has gone all around the borders of Moab,
ISA.15.8	Its wailing to Eglaim
ISA.15.8	And its wailing to Beer Elim.
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon will be full of blood;
ISA.15.9	Because I will bring more upon Dimon,
ISA.15.9	Lions upon him who escapes from Moab,
ISA.15.9	And on the remnant of the land.”
ISA.16.1	Send 
ISA.16.1	From Sela to the wilderness,
ISA.16.1	To the mount of the daughter of Zion.
ISA.16.2	For it shall be as a 
ISA.16.2	 shall be the daughters of Moab at the fords of the 
ISA.16.3	“Take counsel, execute judgment;
ISA.16.3	Make your shadow like the night in the middle of the day;
ISA.16.3	Hide the outcasts,
ISA.16.3	Do not betray him who escapes.
ISA.16.4	Let My outcasts dwell with you, O Moab;
ISA.16.4	Be a shelter to them from the face of the spoiler.
ISA.16.4	For the extortioner is at an end,
ISA.16.4	Devastation ceases,
ISA.16.4	The oppressors are consumed out of the land.
ISA.16.5	In mercy 
ISA.16.5	And One will sit on it in truth, in the tabernacle of David,
ISA.16.5	Judging and seeking justice and hastening 
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the 
ISA.16.6	Of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath;
ISA.16.6	 his lies 
ISA.16.7	Therefore Moab shall 
ISA.16.7	Everyone shall wail.
ISA.16.7	For the foundations 
ISA.16.7	Surely 
ISA.16.8	For 
ISA.16.8	The lords of the nations have broken down its choice plants,
ISA.16.8	Which have reached to Jazer
ISA.16.8	And wandered through the wilderness.
ISA.16.8	Her branches are stretched out,
ISA.16.8	They are gone over the 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will bewail the vine of Sibmah,
ISA.16.9	With the weeping of Jazer;
ISA.16.9	I will drench you with my tears,
ISA.16.9	O Heshbon and Elealeh;
ISA.16.9	For battle cries have fallen
ISA.16.9	Over your summer fruits and your harvest.
ISA.16.10	Gladness is taken away,
ISA.16.10	And joy from the plentiful field;
ISA.16.10	In the vineyards there will be no singing,
ISA.16.10	Nor will there be shouting;
ISA.16.10	No treaders will tread out wine in the presses;
ISA.16.10	I have made their shouting cease.
ISA.16.11	Therefore 
ISA.16.11	And my inner being for Kir Heres.
ISA.16.12	And it shall come to pass,
ISA.16.12	When it is seen that Moab is weary on 
ISA.16.12	That he will come to his sanctuary to pray;
ISA.16.12	But he will not prevail.
ISA.16.13	This 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	The 
ISA.17.1	“Behold, Damascus will cease from 
ISA.17.1	And it will be a ruinous heap.
ISA.17.2	The cities of 
ISA.17.2	They will be for flocks
ISA.17.2	Which lie down, and 
ISA.17.3	The fortress also will cease from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	The kingdom from Damascus,
ISA.17.3	And the remnant of Syria;
ISA.17.3	They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,”
ISA.17.3	Says the 
ISA.17.4	“In that day it shall come to pass
ISA.17.4	 the glory of Jacob will wane,
ISA.17.4	And 
ISA.17.5	It shall be as when the harvester gathers the grain,
ISA.17.5	And reaps the heads with his arm;
ISA.17.5	It shall be as he who gathers heads of grain
ISA.17.5	In the Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet gleaning grapes will be left in it,
ISA.17.6	Like the shaking of an olive tree,
ISA.17.6	Two 
ISA.17.6	Four 
ISA.17.6	Says the 
ISA.17.7	In that day a man will 
ISA.17.7	And his eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	He will not look to the altars,
ISA.17.8	The work of his hands;
ISA.17.8	He will not respect what his 
ISA.17.8	Nor the wooden images nor the incense altars.
ISA.17.9	In that day his strong cities will be as a forsaken bough
ISA.17.9	And an uppermost branch,
ISA.17.9	Which they left because of the children of Israel;
ISA.17.9	And there will be desolation.
ISA.17.10	Because you have forgotten 
ISA.17.10	And have not been mindful of the Rock of your stronghold,
ISA.17.10	Therefore you will plant pleasant plants
ISA.17.10	And set out foreign seedlings;
ISA.17.11	In the day you will make your plant to grow,
ISA.17.11	And in the morning you will make your seed to flourish;
ISA.17.11	 the harvest 
ISA.17.11	In the day of grief and desperate sorrow.
ISA.17.12	Woe to the multitude of many people
ISA.17.12	 make a noise 
ISA.17.12	And to the rushing of nations
ISA.17.12	 make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!
ISA.17.13	The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters;
ISA.17.13	But 
ISA.17.13	And 
ISA.17.13	Like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.
ISA.17.14	Then behold, at eventide, trouble!
ISA.17.14	 before the morning, he 
ISA.17.14	This 
ISA.17.14	And the lot of those who rob us.
ISA.18.1	Woe 
ISA.18.1	Which 
ISA.18.2	Which sends ambassadors by sea,
ISA.18.2	Even in vessels of reed on the waters, 
ISA.18.2	“Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth 
ISA.18.2	To a people terrible from their beginning onward,
ISA.18.2	A nation powerful and treading down,
ISA.18.2	Whose land the rivers divide.”
ISA.18.3	All inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth:
ISA.18.3	When he lifts up a banner on the mountains, you see 
ISA.18.3	And when he blows a trumpet, you hear 
ISA.18.4	For so the 
ISA.18.4	“I will take My rest,
ISA.18.4	And I will look from My dwelling place
ISA.18.4	Like clear heat in sunshine,
ISA.18.4	Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect
ISA.18.5	And the sour grape is ripening in the flower,
ISA.18.5	He will both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks
ISA.18.5	And take away 
ISA.18.6	They will be left together for the mountain birds of prey
ISA.18.6	And for the beasts of the earth;
ISA.18.6	The birds of prey will summer on them,
ISA.18.6	And all the beasts of the earth will winter on them.
ISA.18.7	In that time 
ISA.18.7	From a people tall and smooth 
ISA.18.7	And from a people terrible from their beginning onward,
ISA.18.7	A nation powerful and treading down,
ISA.18.7	Whose land the rivers divide—
ISA.18.7	To the place of the name of the 
ISA.18.7	To Mount Zion.
ISA.19.1	The 
ISA.19.1	Behold, the 
ISA.19.1	And will come into Egypt;
ISA.19.1	The idols of Egypt will totter at His presence,
ISA.19.1	And the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst.
ISA.19.2	“I will 
ISA.19.2	Everyone will fight against his brother,
ISA.19.2	And everyone against his neighbor,
ISA.19.2	City against city, kingdom against kingdom.
ISA.19.3	The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst;
ISA.19.3	I will destroy their counsel,
ISA.19.3	And they will 
ISA.19.3	The mediums and the sorcerers.
ISA.19.4	And the Egyptians I will give
ISA.19.4	Into the hand of a cruel master,
ISA.19.4	And a fierce king will rule over them,”
ISA.19.4	Says the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	The waters will fail from the sea,
ISA.19.5	And the river will be wasted and dried up.
ISA.19.6	The rivers will turn foul;
ISA.19.6	The brooks 
ISA.19.6	The reeds and rushes will wither.
ISA.19.7	The papyrus reeds by the River, by the mouth of the River,
ISA.19.7	And everything sown by the River,
ISA.19.7	Will wither, be driven away, and be no more.
ISA.19.8	The fishermen also will mourn;
ISA.19.8	All those will lament who cast hooks into the River,
ISA.19.8	And they will languish who spread nets on the waters.
ISA.19.9	Moreover those who work in 
ISA.19.9	And those who weave fine fabric will be ashamed;
ISA.19.10	And its foundations will be broken.
ISA.19.10	All who make wages 
ISA.19.11	Surely the princes of 
ISA.19.11	Pharaoh’s wise counselors give foolish counsel.
ISA.19.11	How do you say to Pharaoh, “I 
ISA.19.11	The son of ancient kings?”
ISA.19.12	Where 
ISA.19.12	Where are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Let them tell you now,
ISA.19.12	And let them know what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have become fools;
ISA.19.13	The princes of Noph are deceived;
ISA.19.13	They have also deluded Egypt,
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.14	And they have caused Egypt to err in all her work,
ISA.19.14	As a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	Neither will there be 
ISA.19.15	Which 
ISA.19.15	Palm branch or bulrush, may do.
ISA.19.16	In that day Egypt will 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah will be a terror to Egypt; everyone who makes mention of it will be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will 
ISA.19.19	In that day 
ISA.19.20	And 
ISA.19.21	Then the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day 
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel will be one of three with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing in the midst of the land, 
ISA.19.25	whom the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that 
ISA.20.2	at the same time the 
ISA.20.3	Then the 
ISA.20.4	so shall the 
ISA.20.5	Then they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation and Egypt their glory. 
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant of this territory will say in that day, ‘Surely such 
ISA.21.1	The burden against the Wilderness of the Sea.
ISA.21.1	As 
ISA.21.1	 it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.
ISA.21.2	A distressing vision is declared to me;
ISA.21.2	The treacherous dealer deals treacherously,
ISA.21.2	And the plunderer plunders.
ISA.21.2	Go up, O Elam!
ISA.21.2	Besiege, O Media!
ISA.21.2	All its sighing I have made to cease.
ISA.21.3	Therefore 
ISA.21.3	Pangs have taken hold of me, like the pangs of a woman in labor.
ISA.21.3	I was distressed when 
ISA.21.3	I was dismayed when 
ISA.21.4	My heart wavered, fearfulness frightened me;
ISA.21.4	The night for which I longed He turned into fear for me.
ISA.21.5	Prepare the table,
ISA.21.5	Set a watchman in the tower,
ISA.21.5	Eat and drink.
ISA.21.5	Arise, you princes,
ISA.21.5	Anoint the shield!
ISA.21.6	For thus has the Lord said to me:
ISA.21.6	“Go, set a watchman,
ISA.21.6	Let him declare what he sees.”
ISA.21.7	And he saw a chariot 
ISA.21.7	A chariot of donkeys, 
ISA.21.7	And he listened earnestly with great care.
ISA.21.8	Then he cried, “A lion, my Lord!
ISA.21.8	I stand continually on the 
ISA.21.8	I have sat at my post every night.
ISA.21.9	And look, here comes a chariot of men 
ISA.21.9	Then he answered and said,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon is fallen, is fallen!
ISA.21.9	And 
ISA.21.9	He has broken to the ground.”
ISA.21.10	Oh, my threshing and the grain of my floor!
ISA.21.10	That which I have heard from the 
ISA.21.10	The God of Israel,
ISA.21.10	I have declared to you.
ISA.21.11	The burden against Dumah.
ISA.21.11	He calls to me out of 
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, what of the night?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, what of the night?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman said,
ISA.21.12	“The morning comes, and also the night.
ISA.21.12	If you will inquire, inquire;
ISA.21.12	Return! Come back!”
ISA.21.13	The burden against Arabia.
ISA.21.13	In the forest in Arabia you will lodge,
ISA.21.13	O you traveling companies 
ISA.21.14	O inhabitants of the land of Tema,
ISA.21.14	Bring water to him who is thirsty;
ISA.21.14	With their bread they met him who fled.
ISA.21.15	For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword,
ISA.21.15	From the bent bow, and from the distress of war.
ISA.21.16	For thus the 
ISA.21.17	and the remainder of the number of archers, the mighty men of the people of Kedar, will be diminished; for the 
ISA.22.1	The burden against the Valley of Vision.
ISA.22.1	What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops,
ISA.22.2	You who are full of noise,
ISA.22.2	A tumultuous city, 
ISA.22.2	Your slain 
ISA.22.2	Nor dead in battle.
ISA.22.3	All your rulers have fled together;
ISA.22.3	They are captured by the archers.
ISA.22.3	All who are found in you are bound together;
ISA.22.3	They have fled from afar.
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said, “Look away from me,
ISA.22.4	I will weep bitterly;
ISA.22.4	Do not labor to comfort me
ISA.22.4	Because of the plundering of the daughter of my people.”
ISA.22.5	For 
ISA.22.5	By the Lord 
ISA.22.5	In the Valley of Vision—
ISA.22.5	Breaking down the walls
ISA.22.5	And of crying to the mountain.
ISA.22.6	Elam bore the quiver
ISA.22.6	With chariots of men 
ISA.22.6	And 
ISA.22.7	It shall come to pass 
ISA.22.7	Shall be full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	And the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.
ISA.22.8	He removed the protection of Judah.
ISA.22.8	You looked in that day to the armor 
ISA.22.9	You also saw the damage to the city of David,
ISA.22.9	That it was great;
ISA.22.9	And you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	You numbered the houses of Jerusalem,
ISA.22.10	And the houses you broke down
ISA.22.10	To fortify the wall.
ISA.22.11	You also made a reservoir between the two walls
ISA.22.11	For the water of the old 
ISA.22.11	But you did not look to its Maker,
ISA.22.11	Nor did you have respect for Him who fashioned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	And in that day the Lord 
ISA.22.12	Called for weeping and for mourning,
ISA.22.12	For baldness and for girding with sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	But instead, joy and gladness,
ISA.22.13	Slaying oxen and killing sheep,
ISA.22.13	Eating meat and 
ISA.22.13	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
ISA.22.14	Then it was revealed in my hearing by the 
ISA.22.14	“Surely for this iniquity there 
ISA.22.14	Even to your death,” says the Lord 
ISA.22.15	Thus says the Lord 
ISA.22.15	“Go, proceed to this steward,
ISA.22.15	To 
ISA.22.16	‘What have you here, and whom have you here,
ISA.22.16	That you have hewn a sepulcher here,
ISA.22.16	 he 
ISA.22.16	Who carves a tomb for himself in a rock?
ISA.22.17	Indeed, the 
ISA.22.17	O mighty man,
ISA.22.17	And will surely seize you.
ISA.22.18	He will surely turn violently and toss you like a ball
ISA.22.18	Into a large country;
ISA.22.18	There you shall die, and there 
ISA.22.19	So I will drive you out of your office,
ISA.22.19	And from your position he will pull you down.
ISA.22.20	‘Then it shall be in that day,
ISA.22.20	That I will call My servant 
ISA.22.21	I will clothe him with your robe
ISA.22.21	And strengthen him with your belt;
ISA.22.21	I will commit your responsibility into his hand.
ISA.22.21	He shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
ISA.22.21	And to the house of Judah.
ISA.22.22	The key of the house of David
ISA.22.22	I will lay on his 
ISA.22.22	So he shall 
ISA.22.22	And he shall shut, and no one shall open.
ISA.22.23	I will fasten him 
ISA.22.23	And he will become a glorious throne to his father’s house.
ISA.22.24	‘They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the posterity, all vessels of small quantity, from the cups to all the pitchers. 
ISA.22.25	In that day,’ says the 
ISA.23.1	The 
ISA.23.1	Wail, you ships of Tarshish!
ISA.23.1	For it is laid waste,
ISA.23.1	So that there is no house, no harbor;
ISA.23.1	From the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them.
ISA.23.2	Be still, you inhabitants of the coastland,
ISA.23.2	You merchants of Sidon,
ISA.23.2	Whom those who cross the sea have filled.
ISA.23.3	And on great waters the grain of Shihor,
ISA.23.3	The harvest of the River, 
ISA.23.3	And 
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, O Sidon;
ISA.23.4	For the sea has spoken,
ISA.23.4	The strength of the sea, saying,
ISA.23.4	“I do not labor, nor bring forth children;
ISA.23.4	Neither do I rear young men,
ISA.23.4	 bring up virgins.”
ISA.23.5	When the report 
ISA.23.5	They also will be in agony at the report of Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Cross over to Tarshish;
ISA.23.6	Wail, you inhabitants of the coastland!
ISA.23.7	 this your 
ISA.23.7	Whose antiquity 
ISA.23.7	Whose feet carried her far off to dwell?
ISA.23.8	Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, 
ISA.23.8	Whose merchants 
ISA.23.8	Whose traders 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.9	To bring to dishonor the 
ISA.23.9	To bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
ISA.23.10	Overflow through your land like the River,
ISA.23.10	O daughter of Tarshish;
ISA.23.11	He stretched out His hand over the sea,
ISA.23.11	He shook the kingdoms;
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.11	To destroy its strongholds.
ISA.23.12	And He said, “You will rejoice no more,
ISA.23.12	O you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon.
ISA.23.12	Arise, 
ISA.23.12	There also you will have no rest.”
ISA.23.13	Behold, the land of the 
ISA.23.13	This people 
ISA.23.13	Assyria founded it for 
ISA.23.13	They set up its towers,
ISA.23.13	They raised up its palaces,
ISA.23.13	 brought it to ruin.
ISA.23.14	Wail, you ships of Tarshish!
ISA.23.14	For your strength is laid waste.
ISA.23.15	Now it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as 
ISA.23.16	“Take a harp, go about the city,
ISA.23.16	You forgotten harlot;
ISA.23.16	Make sweet melody, sing many songs,
ISA.23.16	That you may be remembered.”
ISA.23.17	And it shall be, at the end of seventy years, that the 
ISA.23.18	Her gain and her pay 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.1	Distorts its surface
ISA.24.1	And scatters abroad its inhabitants.
ISA.24.2	And it shall be:
ISA.24.2	As with the people, so with the 
ISA.24.2	As with the servant, so with his master;
ISA.24.2	As with the maid, so with her mistress;
ISA.24.2	As with the buyer, so with the seller;
ISA.24.2	As with the lender, so with the borrower;
ISA.24.2	As with the creditor, so with the debtor.
ISA.24.3	The land shall be entirely emptied and utterly plundered,
ISA.24.3	For the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns 
ISA.24.4	The world languishes 
ISA.24.4	The 
ISA.24.5	The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants,
ISA.24.5	Because they have 
ISA.24.5	Changed the ordinance,
ISA.24.5	Broken the 
ISA.24.6	Therefore 
ISA.24.6	And those who dwell in it are desolate.
ISA.24.6	Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are 
ISA.24.6	And few men 
ISA.24.7	The new wine fails, the vine languishes,
ISA.24.7	All the merry-hearted sigh.
ISA.24.8	The mirth 
ISA.24.8	The noise of the jubilant ends,
ISA.24.8	The joy of the harp ceases.
ISA.24.9	They shall not drink wine with a song;
ISA.24.9	Strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken down;
ISA.24.10	Every house is shut up, so that none may go in.
ISA.24.11	All joy is darkened,
ISA.24.11	The mirth of the land is gone.
ISA.24.12	In the city desolation is left,
ISA.24.12	And the gate is stricken with destruction.
ISA.24.13	When it shall be thus in the midst of the land among the people,
ISA.24.13	Like the gleaning of grapes when the vintage is done.
ISA.24.14	They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing;
ISA.24.14	For the majesty of the 
ISA.24.14	They shall cry aloud from the sea.
ISA.24.15	Therefore 
ISA.24.15	The name of the 
ISA.24.16	From the ends of the earth we have heard songs:
ISA.24.16	“Glory to the righteous!”
ISA.24.16	But I said, “I am ruined, ruined!
ISA.24.16	Woe to me!
ISA.24.16	The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously,
ISA.24.16	Indeed, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.”
ISA.24.17	Fear and the pit and the snare
ISA.24.17	 upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.
ISA.24.18	And it shall be
ISA.24.18	 he who flees from the noise of the fear
ISA.24.18	Shall fall into the pit,
ISA.24.18	And he who comes up from the midst of the pit
ISA.24.18	Shall be caught in the snare;
ISA.24.18	For 
ISA.24.18	And 
ISA.24.19	The earth is violently broken,
ISA.24.19	The earth is split open,
ISA.24.19	The earth is shaken exceedingly.
ISA.24.20	The earth shall 
ISA.24.20	And shall totter like a hut;
ISA.24.20	Its transgression shall be heavy upon it,
ISA.24.20	And it will fall, and not rise again.
ISA.24.21	It shall come to pass in that day
ISA.24.21	 the 
ISA.24.21	And on the earth 
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together,
ISA.24.22	 prisoners are gathered in the pit,
ISA.24.22	And will be shut up in the prison;
ISA.24.22	After many days they will be punished.
ISA.24.23	Then the 
ISA.24.23	And the sun ashamed;
ISA.24.23	For the 
ISA.24.23	On 
ISA.24.23	And before His elders, gloriously.
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.1	I will exalt You,
ISA.25.1	I will praise Your name,
ISA.25.1	For You have done wonderful 
ISA.25.1	 counsels of old 
ISA.25.2	For You have made 
ISA.25.2	A fortified city a ruin,
ISA.25.2	A palace of foreigners to be a city no more;
ISA.25.2	It will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore the strong people will 
ISA.25.3	The city of the terrible nations will fear You.
ISA.25.4	For You have been a strength to the poor,
ISA.25.4	A strength to the needy in his distress,
ISA.25.4	A refuge from the storm,
ISA.25.4	A shade from the heat;
ISA.25.4	For the blast of the terrible ones 
ISA.25.5	You will reduce the noise of aliens,
ISA.25.5	As heat in a dry place;
ISA.25.5	 heat in the shadow of a cloud,
ISA.25.5	The song of the terrible ones will be diminished.
ISA.25.6	And in 
ISA.25.6	The 
ISA.25.6	A feast of choice pieces,
ISA.25.6	A feast of wines on the lees,
ISA.25.6	Of fat things full of marrow,
ISA.25.6	Of well-refined wines on the lees.
ISA.25.7	And He will destroy on this mountain
ISA.25.7	The surface of the covering cast over all people,
ISA.25.7	And 
ISA.25.8	He will 
ISA.25.8	And the Lord 
ISA.25.8	The rebuke of His people
ISA.25.8	He will take away from all the earth;
ISA.25.8	For the 
ISA.25.9	And it will be said in that day:
ISA.25.9	“Behold, this 
ISA.25.9	We have waited for Him, and He will save us.
ISA.25.9	This 
ISA.25.9	We have waited for Him;
ISA.25.9	We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.”
ISA.25.10	For on this mountain the hand of the 
ISA.25.10	And 
ISA.25.10	As straw is trampled down for the refuse heap.
ISA.25.11	And He will spread out His hands in their midst
ISA.25.11	As a swimmer reaches out to swim,
ISA.25.11	And He will bring down their 
ISA.25.11	Together with the trickery of their hands.
ISA.25.12	The 
ISA.25.12	He will bring down, lay low,
ISA.25.12	 bring to the ground, down to the dust.
ISA.26.1	In 
ISA.26.1	“We have a strong city;
ISA.26.1	 will appoint salvation 
ISA.26.2	Open the gates,
ISA.26.2	That the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in.
ISA.26.3	You will keep 
ISA.26.3	 mind 
ISA.26.3	Because he trusts in You.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	For in YAH, the 
ISA.26.5	For He brings down those who dwell on high,
ISA.26.5	The lofty city;
ISA.26.5	He lays it low,
ISA.26.5	He lays it low to the ground,
ISA.26.5	He brings it down to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The foot shall tread it down—
ISA.26.6	The feet of the poor
ISA.26.6	 the steps of the needy.”
ISA.26.7	The way of the just 
ISA.26.7	O Most Upright,
ISA.26.7	You weigh the path of the just.
ISA.26.8	Yes, 
ISA.26.8	O 
ISA.26.8	The desire of 
ISA.26.8	And for the remembrance of You.
ISA.26.9	With my soul I have desired You in the night,
ISA.26.9	Yes, by my spirit within me I will seek You early;
ISA.26.9	For when Your judgments 
ISA.26.9	The inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	Let grace be shown to the wicked,
ISA.26.10	 he will not learn righteousness;
ISA.26.10	In 
ISA.26.10	And will not behold the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	, 
ISA.26.11	But they will see and be ashamed
ISA.26.11	For 
ISA.26.11	Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them.
ISA.26.12	, You will establish peace for us,
ISA.26.12	For You have also done all our works in us.
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.13	Have had dominion over us;
ISA.26.13	 by You only we make mention of Your name.
ISA.26.14	Therefore You have punished and destroyed them,
ISA.26.14	And made all their memory to 
ISA.26.15	You have increased the nation, O 
ISA.26.15	You have 
ISA.26.15	You are glorified;
ISA.26.15	You have expanded all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	, 
ISA.26.16	They poured out a prayer 
ISA.26.17	As 
ISA.26.17	Is in pain and cries out in her pangs,
ISA.26.17	 she draws near the time of her delivery,
ISA.26.17	So have we been in Your sight, O 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child, we have been in pain;
ISA.26.18	We have, as it were, brought forth wind;
ISA.26.18	We have not accomplished any deliverance in the earth,
ISA.26.18	Nor have 
ISA.26.19	Your dead shall live;
ISA.26.19	Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust;
ISA.26.19	For your dew 
ISA.26.19	And the earth shall cast out the dead.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, 
ISA.26.20	And shut your doors behind you;
ISA.26.20	Hide yourself, as it were, 
ISA.26.20	Until the indignation is past.
ISA.26.21	For behold, the 
ISA.26.21	To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity;
ISA.26.21	The earth will also disclose her blood,
ISA.26.21	And will no more cover her slain.
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.1	Will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent,
ISA.27.1	Leviathan that twisted serpent;
ISA.27.1	And He will slay 
ISA.27.2	In that day 
ISA.27.2	“A vineyard of red wine!
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.3	I water it every moment;
ISA.27.3	Lest any hurt it,
ISA.27.3	I keep it night and day.
ISA.27.4	Fury 
ISA.27.4	Who would set 
ISA.27.4	Against Me in battle?
ISA.27.4	I would go through them,
ISA.27.4	I would burn them together.
ISA.27.5	Or let him take hold 
ISA.27.5	 he may 
ISA.27.5	 he shall make peace with Me.”
ISA.27.6	Those who come He shall cause 
ISA.27.6	Israel shall blossom and bud,
ISA.27.6	And fill the face of the world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Has He struck Israel as He struck those who struck him?
ISA.27.7	Or has He been slain according to the slaughter of those who were slain by Him?
ISA.27.8	In measure, by sending it away,
ISA.27.8	You contended with it.
ISA.27.8	He removes 
ISA.27.8	In the day of the east wind.
ISA.27.9	Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be covered;
ISA.27.9	And this 
ISA.27.9	When he makes all the stones of the altar
ISA.27.9	Like chalkstones that are beaten to dust,
ISA.27.9	Wooden images and incense altars shall not stand.
ISA.27.10	Yet the fortified city 
ISA.27.10	The habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness;
ISA.27.10	There the calf will feed, and there it will lie down
ISA.27.10	And consume its branches.
ISA.27.11	When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off;
ISA.27.11	The women come 
ISA.27.11	For 
ISA.27.11	Therefore He who made them will 
ISA.27.11	And 
ISA.27.12	And it shall come to pass in that day
ISA.27.12	 the 
ISA.27.12	From the channel of the River to the Brook of Egypt;
ISA.27.12	And you will be 
ISA.27.12	O you children of Israel.
ISA.27.13	So it shall be in that day:
ISA.27.13	The great trumpet will be blown;
ISA.27.13	They will come, who are about to perish in the land of Assyria,
ISA.27.13	And they who are outcasts in the land of 
ISA.27.13	And shall 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,
ISA.28.1	Whose glorious beauty 
ISA.28.1	Which 
ISA.28.1	To those who are overcome with wine!
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one,
ISA.28.2	Like a tempest of hail and a destroying storm,
ISA.28.2	Like a flood of mighty waters overflowing,
ISA.28.2	Who will bring 
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim,
ISA.28.3	Will be trampled underfoot;
ISA.28.4	And the glorious beauty is a fading flower
ISA.28.4	Which 
ISA.28.4	Like the first fruit before the summer,
ISA.28.4	Which an observer sees;
ISA.28.4	He eats it up while it is still in his hand.
ISA.28.5	In that day the 
ISA.28.5	For a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty
ISA.28.5	To the remnant of His people,
ISA.28.6	For a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
ISA.28.6	And for strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
ISA.28.7	But they also 
ISA.28.7	And through intoxicating drink are out of the way;
ISA.28.7	The priest and the prophet have erred through intoxicating drink,
ISA.28.7	They are swallowed up by wine,
ISA.28.7	They are out of the way through intoxicating drink;
ISA.28.7	They err in vision, they stumble 
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit 
ISA.28.8	No place 
ISA.28.9	“Whom
ISA.28.9	And whom will he make to understand the message?
ISA.28.9	Those 
ISA.28.9	Those 
ISA.28.10	For precept 
ISA.28.10	Line upon line, line upon line,
ISA.28.10	Here a little, there a little.”
ISA.28.11	For with 
ISA.28.11	He will speak to this people,
ISA.28.12	To whom He said, “This 
ISA.28.12	You may cause the weary to rest,”
ISA.28.12	And, “This 
ISA.28.12	Yet they would not hear.
ISA.28.13	But the word of the 
ISA.28.13	“Precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
ISA.28.13	Line upon line, line upon line,
ISA.28.13	Here a little, there a little,”
ISA.28.13	That they might go and fall backward, and be broken
ISA.28.13	And snared and caught.
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.14	Who rule this people who 
ISA.28.15	Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,
ISA.28.15	And with Sheol we are in agreement.
ISA.28.15	When the overflowing scourge passes through,
ISA.28.15	It will not come to us,
ISA.28.15	For we have made lies our refuge,
ISA.28.15	And under falsehood we have hidden ourselves.”
ISA.28.16	Therefore thus says the Lord 
ISA.28.16	“Behold, I lay in Zion 
ISA.28.16	A tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation;
ISA.28.16	Whoever believes will not act hastily.
ISA.28.17	Also I will make justice the measuring line,
ISA.28.17	And righteousness the plummet;
ISA.28.17	The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
ISA.28.17	And the waters will overflow the hiding place.
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with death will be annulled,
ISA.28.18	And your agreement with Sheol will not stand;
ISA.28.18	When the overflowing scourge passes through,
ISA.28.18	Then you will be trampled down by it.
ISA.28.19	As often as it goes out it will take you;
ISA.28.19	For morning by morning it will pass over,
ISA.28.19	And by day and by night;
ISA.28.19	It will be a terror just to understand the report.”
ISA.28.20	For the bed is too short to stretch out 
ISA.28.20	And the covering so narrow that one cannot wrap himself 
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.21	He will be angry as in the Valley of 
ISA.28.21	That He may do His work, 
ISA.28.21	And bring to pass His act, His unusual act.
ISA.28.22	Now therefore, do not be mockers,
ISA.28.22	Lest your bonds be made strong;
ISA.28.22	For I have heard from the Lord 
ISA.28.22	A destruction determined even upon the whole earth.
ISA.28.23	Give ear and hear my voice,
ISA.28.23	Listen and hear my speech.
ISA.28.24	Does the plowman keep plowing all day to sow?
ISA.28.24	Does he keep turning his soil and breaking the clods?
ISA.28.25	When he has leveled its surface,
ISA.28.25	Does he not sow the black cummin
ISA.28.25	And scatter the cummin,
ISA.28.25	Plant the wheat in rows,
ISA.28.25	The barley in the appointed place,
ISA.28.25	And the spelt in its place?
ISA.28.26	For He instructs him in right judgment,
ISA.28.26	His God teaches him.
ISA.28.27	For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing sledge,
ISA.28.27	Nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cummin;
ISA.28.27	But the black cummin is beaten out with a stick,
ISA.28.27	And the cummin with a rod.
ISA.28.28	Bread 
ISA.28.28	Therefore he does not thresh it forever,
ISA.28.28	Break 
ISA.28.28	Or crush it 
ISA.28.29	This also comes from the 
ISA.28.29	 is wonderful in counsel 
ISA.29.1	“Woe 
ISA.29.1	Add year to year;
ISA.29.1	Let feasts come around.
ISA.29.2	Yet I will distress Ariel;
ISA.29.2	There shall be heaviness and sorrow,
ISA.29.2	And it shall be to Me as Ariel.
ISA.29.3	I will encamp against you all around,
ISA.29.3	I will lay siege against you with a mound,
ISA.29.3	And I will raise siegeworks against you.
ISA.29.4	You shall be brought down,
ISA.29.4	You shall speak out of the ground;
ISA.29.4	Your speech shall be low, out of the dust;
ISA.29.4	Your voice shall be like a medium’s, 
ISA.29.4	And your speech shall whisper out of the dust.
ISA.29.5	“Moreover the multitude of your 
ISA.29.5	Shall be like fine dust,
ISA.29.5	And the multitude of the terrible ones
ISA.29.5	Like 
ISA.29.5	Yes, it shall be 
ISA.29.6	You will be punished by the 
ISA.29.6	With thunder and 
ISA.29.6	 storm and tempest
ISA.29.6	And the flame of devouring fire.
ISA.29.7	The multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel,
ISA.29.7	Even all who fight against her and her fortress,
ISA.29.7	And distress her,
ISA.29.7	Shall be 
ISA.29.8	It shall even be as when a hungry man dreams,
ISA.29.8	And look—he eats;
ISA.29.8	But he awakes, and his soul is still empty;
ISA.29.8	Or as when a thirsty man dreams,
ISA.29.8	And look—he drinks;
ISA.29.8	But he awakes, and indeed 
ISA.29.8	And his soul still craves:
ISA.29.8	So the multitude of all the nations shall be,
ISA.29.8	Who fight against Mount Zion.”
ISA.29.9	Pause and wonder!
ISA.29.9	Blind yourselves and be blind!
ISA.29.9	They are drunk, 
ISA.29.9	They stagger, but not with intoxicating drink.
ISA.29.10	For 
ISA.29.10	The spirit of deep sleep,
ISA.29.10	And has 
ISA.29.10	And He has covered your heads, 
ISA.29.11	The whole vision has become to you like the words of a book 
ISA.29.11	And he says, “I cannot, for it 
ISA.29.12	Then the book is delivered to one who is illiterate, saying, “Read this, please.”
ISA.29.12	And he says, “I am not literate.”
ISA.29.13	Therefore the Lord said:
ISA.29.13	“Inasmuch as these people draw near with their mouths
ISA.29.13	And honor Me 
ISA.29.13	But have removed their hearts far from Me,
ISA.29.13	And their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men,
ISA.29.14	Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvelous work
ISA.29.14	Among this people,
ISA.29.14	A marvelous work and a wonder;
ISA.29.14	For the wisdom of their wise 
ISA.29.14	And the understanding of their prudent 
ISA.29.15	Woe to those who seek deep to hide their counsel far from the 
ISA.29.15	And their works are in the dark;
ISA.29.15	They say, “Who sees us?” and, “Who knows us?”
ISA.29.16	Surely you have things turned around!
ISA.29.16	Shall the potter be esteemed as the clay;
ISA.29.16	For shall the 
ISA.29.16	“He did not make me”?
ISA.29.16	Or shall the thing formed say of him who formed it,
ISA.29.16	“He has no understanding”?
ISA.29.17	 it not yet a very little while
ISA.29.17	Till 
ISA.29.17	And the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest?
ISA.29.18	In that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book,
ISA.29.18	And the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
ISA.29.19	The humble also shall increase 
ISA.29.19	And 
ISA.29.19	In the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	For the terrible one is brought to nothing,
ISA.29.20	The scornful one is consumed,
ISA.29.20	And all who 
ISA.29.21	Who make a man an offender by a word,
ISA.29.21	And 
ISA.29.21	And turn aside the just 
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus says the 
ISA.29.22	“Jacob shall not now be 
ISA.29.22	Nor shall his face now grow pale;
ISA.29.23	But when he sees his children,
ISA.29.23	The work of My hands, in his midst,
ISA.29.23	They will hallow My name,
ISA.29.23	And hallow the Holy One of Jacob,
ISA.29.23	And fear the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	These also 
ISA.29.24	And those who complained will learn doctrine.”
ISA.30.1	“Woe to the rebellious children,” says the 
ISA.30.1	“Who take counsel, but not of Me,
ISA.30.1	And who devise plans, but not of My Spirit,
ISA.30.1	That they may add sin to sin;
ISA.30.2	Who walk to go down to Egypt,
ISA.30.2	And 
ISA.30.2	To strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
ISA.30.2	And to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
ISA.30.3	Therefore the strength of Pharaoh
ISA.30.3	Shall be your shame,
ISA.30.3	And trust in the shadow of Egypt
ISA.30.3	Shall be 
ISA.30.4	For his princes were at 
ISA.30.4	And his ambassadors came to Hanes.
ISA.30.5	They were all ashamed of a people 
ISA.30.5	Or be help or benefit,
ISA.30.5	But a shame and also a reproach.”
ISA.30.6	The burden against the beasts of the South.
ISA.30.6	Through a land of trouble and anguish,
ISA.30.6	From which 
ISA.30.6	The viper and fiery flying serpent,
ISA.30.6	They will carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys,
ISA.30.6	And their treasures on the humps of camels,
ISA.30.6	To a people 
ISA.30.7	For the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose.
ISA.30.7	Therefore I have called her
ISA.30.7	Rahab-Hem-Shebeth.
ISA.30.8	Now go, 
ISA.30.8	And note it on a scroll,
ISA.30.8	That it may be for time to come,
ISA.30.8	Forever and ever:
ISA.30.9	That 
ISA.30.9	Lying children,
ISA.30.9	Children 
ISA.30.10	Who say to the seers, “Do not see,”
ISA.30.10	And to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us right things;
ISA.30.10	Speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits.
ISA.30.11	Get out of the way,
ISA.30.11	Turn aside from the path,
ISA.30.11	Cause the Holy One of Israel
ISA.30.11	To cease from before us.”
ISA.30.12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.30.12	“Because you 
ISA.30.12	And trust in oppression and perversity,
ISA.30.12	And rely on them,
ISA.30.13	Therefore this iniquity shall be to you
ISA.30.13	Like a breach ready to fall,
ISA.30.13	A bulge in a high wall,
ISA.30.13	Whose breaking 
ISA.30.14	And 
ISA.30.14	Which is broken in pieces;
ISA.30.14	He shall not spare.
ISA.30.14	So there shall not be found among its fragments
ISA.30.14	A shard to take fire from the hearth,
ISA.30.14	Or to take water from the cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For thus says the Lord 
ISA.30.15	“In returning and rest you shall be saved;
ISA.30.15	In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.”
ISA.30.15	But you would not,
ISA.30.16	And you said, “No, for we will flee on horses”—
ISA.30.16	Therefore you shall flee!
ISA.30.16	And, “We will ride on swift 
ISA.30.16	Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift!
ISA.30.17	One thousand 
ISA.30.17	At the threat of five you shall flee,
ISA.30.17	Till you are left as a pole on top of a mountain
ISA.30.17	And as a banner on a hill.
ISA.30.18	Therefore the 
ISA.30.18	And therefore He will be exalted, that He may have mercy on you.
ISA.30.18	For the 
ISA.30.18	Blessed

ISA.30.21	Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying,
ISA.30.21	“This 
ISA.30.21	Whenever you 
ISA.30.21	Or whenever you turn to the left.
ISA.30.22	You will also defile the covering of your images of silver,
ISA.30.22	And the ornament of your molded images of gold.
ISA.30.22	You will throw them away as an unclean thing;
ISA.30.22	You will say to them, “Get away!”
ISA.30.23	Then He will give the rain for your seed
ISA.30.23	With which you sow the ground,
ISA.30.23	And bread of the increase of the earth;
ISA.30.23	It will be fat and plentiful.
ISA.30.23	In that day your cattle will feed
ISA.30.23	In large pastures.
ISA.30.24	Likewise the oxen and the young donkeys that work the ground
ISA.30.24	Will eat cured fodder,

ISA.31.3	And their horses are flesh, and not spirit.
ISA.31.3	When the

ISA.32.5	The foolish person will no longer be called generous,
ISA.32.5	Nor the miser said 
ISA.32.6	For the foolish person will speak foolishness,
ISA.32.6	And his heart will work 
ISA.32.6	To practice ungodliness,

ISA.32.12	For the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
ISA.32.13	On the land of my people will come up thorns 
ISA.32.13	Yes, on all the happy homes 
ISA.32.14	Because the palaces will be forsaken,
ISA.32.14	The bustling city will be deserted.
ISA.32.14	The forts and towers will become lairs forever,

ISA.32.15	Until 
ISA.32.15	And

ISA.32.17	The work of righteousness will be peace,
ISA.32.17	And the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever.
ISA.32.18	My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation,

ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the people 
ISA.33.3	When You lift Yourself up, the nations shall be scattered;
ISA.33.4	And Your plunder shall be gathered
ISA.33.4	 the gathering of the caterpillar;
ISA.33.4	As the running to and fro of locusts,
ISA.33.4	He shall run upon them.
ISA.33.5	The

ISA.36.1	Now 
ISA.36.2	Then the king of Assyria sent 
ISA.36.3	And 
ISA.36.4	Then 
ISA.36.5	I say you speak of having plans and power for war; but 
ISA.36.6	Look! You are trusting in the 
ISA.36.7	“But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the

ISA.36.10	Have I now come up without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to 
ISA.36.12	But 
ISA.36.13	Then 
ISA.36.14	Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you; 
ISA.36.15	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
ISA.36.16	Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

ISA.36.19	Where 
ISA.36.20	Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the 
ISA.36.21	But they held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” 
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who

ISA.37.4	It may be that the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
ISA.37.6	And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the 
ISA.37.7	Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”
ISA.37.8	Then 
ISA.37.9	And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to make war with you.” So when he heard 
ISA.37.10	“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.37.11	Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Have the 
ISA.37.13	Where 
ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the 
ISA.37.15	Then Hezekiah prayed to the 
ISA.37.16	“O 
ISA.37.17	Incline Your ear, O 
ISA.37.18	Truly, 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they

ISA.37.23	Against whom have you raised 
ISA.37.23	And lifted up your eyes on high?
ISA.37.23	Against the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.37.24	By your servants you have reproached the Lord,
ISA.37.24	And said, ‘By the multitude of my chariots
ISA.37.24	I have come up to the height of the mountains,
ISA.37.24	To the limits of Lebanon;
ISA.37.24	I will cut down its tall cedars
ISA.37.24	 its choice cypress trees;
ISA.37.24	I will enter its farthest height,
ISA.37.24	To its fruitful forest.
ISA.37.25	I have dug and drunk water,
ISA.37.25	And with the soles of my feet I have dried up
ISA.37.25	All the brooks of defense.’
ISA.37.26	“Did you not hear 
ISA.37.26	 I made it,
ISA.37.26	From ancient times that I formed it?
ISA.37.26	Now I have brought it to pass,
ISA.37.26	That you should be
ISA.37.26	For crushing fortified cities 
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants 
ISA.37.27	They were dismayed and confounded;
ISA.37.27	They were 
ISA.37.27	And the green herb,
ISA.37.27	 the grass on the housetops
ISA.37.27	And 
ISA.37.28	“But I know your dwelling place,
ISA.37.28	Your going out and your coming in,
ISA.37.28	And your rage against Me.
ISA.37.29	Because your rage against Me and your tumult
ISA.37.29	Have come up to My ears,
ISA.37.29	Therefore 
ISA.37.29	And My bridle in your lips,

ISA.37.30	“This 
ISA.37.30	You shall eat this year such as grows of itself,
ISA.37.30	And the second year what springs from the same;
ISA.37.30	Also in the third year sow and reap,

ISA.37.31	And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah
ISA.37.31	Shall again take root downward,
ISA.37.31	And bear fruit upward.

ISA.37.32	And those who escape from Mount Zion.
ISA.37.32	The 
ISA.37.33	“Therefore thus says the 
ISA.37.33	‘He shall not come into this city,

ISA.38.1	In 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	and said, 
ISA.38.4	And the word of the 
ISA.38.5	“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the 
ISA.38.6	I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and

ISA.38.9	This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
ISA.38.10	I said,
ISA.38.10	“In the prime of my life
ISA.38.10	I shall go to the gates of Sheol;
ISA.38.10	I am deprived of the remainder of my years.”
ISA.38.11	I said,

ISA.44.9	They neither see nor know, that they may be ashamed.
ISA.44.10	Who would form a god or mold an image
ISA.44.10	 profits him nothing?
ISA.44.11	Surely all his companions would be 
ISA.44.11	And the workmen, they 
ISA.44.11	Let them all be gathered together,
ISA.44.11	Let them stand up;
ISA.44.11	Yet they shall fear,
ISA.44.11	They shall be ashamed together.
ISA.44.12	The blacksmith with the tongs works one in the coals,
ISA.44.12	Fashions it with hammers,
ISA.44.12	And works it with the strength of his arms.
ISA.44.12	Even so, he is hungry, and his strength fails;
ISA.44.12	He drinks no water and is faint.
ISA.44.13	The craftsman stretches out 
ISA.44.13	He marks one out with chalk;
ISA.44.13	He fashions it with a plane,
ISA.44.13	He marks it out with the compass,
ISA.44.13	And makes it like the figure of a man,
ISA.44.13	According to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the house.
ISA.44.14	He cuts down cedars for himself,
ISA.44.14	And takes the cypress and the oak;
ISA.44.14	He secures 
ISA.44.14	He plants a pine, and the rain nourishes 
ISA.44.15	Then it shall be for a man to burn,
ISA.44.15	For he will take some of it and warm himself;
ISA.44.15	Yes, he kindles 
ISA.44.15	Indeed he makes a god and worships 
ISA.44.15	He makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.
ISA.44.16	He burns half of it in the fire;
ISA.44.16	With this half he eats meat;
ISA.44.16	He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.
ISA.44.16	He even warms 
ISA.44.16	“Ah! I am warm,
ISA.44.16	I have seen the fire.”
ISA.44.17	And the rest of it he makes into a god,
ISA.44.17	His carved image.
ISA.44.17	He falls down before it and worships 
ISA.44.17	Prays to it and says,
ISA.44.17	“Deliver me, for you 
ISA.44.18	They do not know nor understand;
ISA.44.18	For 
ISA.44.18	 their hearts, so that they cannot

ISA.44.19	Nor 
ISA.44.19	“I have burned half of it in the fire,
ISA.44.19	Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals;
ISA.44.19	I have roasted meat and eaten 
ISA.44.19	And shall I make the rest of it an abomination?
ISA.44.19	Shall I fall down before a block of wood?”
ISA.44.20	He feeds on ashes;
ISA.44.20	A deceived heart has turned him aside;
ISA.44.20	And he cannot deliver his soul,
ISA.44.20	Nor say, “
ISA.44.21	“Remember these, O Jacob,
ISA.44.21	And Israel, for you 
ISA.44.21	I have formed you, you

ISA.44.23	O forest, and every tree in it!
ISA.44.23	For the 
ISA.44.23	And

ISA.44.24	And 
ISA.44.24	“I

ISA.44.25	And drives diviners mad;
ISA.44.25	Who turns wise men backward,
ISA.44.25	And makes their knowledge foolishness;
ISA.44.26	Who confirms the word of His servant,
ISA.44.26	And performs the counsel of His messengers;
ISA.44.26	Who says to Jerusalem, ‘You shall be inhabited,’
ISA.44.26	To the cities of Judah, ‘You shall be built,’
ISA.44.26	And I will raise up her waste places;
ISA.44.27	Who says to the deep, ‘Be dry!
ISA.44.27	And I will dry up your rivers’;
ISA.44.28	Who says of 
ISA.44.28	And he shall perform all My pleasure,
ISA.44.28	Saying to Jerusalem, 
ISA.44.28	And to the temple, “Your foundation shall be laid.” ’
ISA.45.1	“Thus says the 
ISA.45.1	To 
ISA.45.1	To subdue nations before him

ISA.45.1	To open before him the double doors,
ISA.45.1	So that the gates will not be shut:
ISA.45.2	‘I will go before you

ISA.45.10	Or to the woman, ‘What have you brought forth?’ ”
ISA.45.11	Thus says the 
ISA.45.11	The Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:
ISA.45.11	“Ask Me of things to come concerning 
ISA.45.11	And concerning

ISA.48.6	I have made you hear new things from this time,
ISA.48.6	Even hidden things, and you did not know them.

ISA.48.8	Surely you did not hear,
ISA.48.8	Surely you did not know;

ISA.48.16	I have not spoken in secret from the beginning;
ISA.48.16	From the time that it was, I

ISA.48.19	Nor destroyed from before Me.”
ISA.48.20	Go forth from Babylon!
ISA.48.20	Flee from the Chaldeans!
ISA.48.20	With a voice of singing,
ISA.48.20	Declare, proclaim this,
ISA.48.20	Utter it to the end of the earth;
ISA.48.20	Say, “The 
ISA.48.20	His servant Jacob!”
ISA.48.21	And they 
ISA.48.21	When He led them through the deserts;

ISA.49.1	“Listen, 
ISA.49.1	And take heed, you peoples from afar!

ISA.49.1	From the matrix of My mother He has made mention of My name.
ISA.49.2	And He has made 
ISA.49.2	In the shadow of His hand He has hidden Me,

ISA.49.2	In His quiver He has hidden Me.”
ISA.49.3	“And He said to me,
ISA.49.3	‘You 
ISA.49.3	In whom I will be glorified.’
ISA.49.4	Then I said, ‘I have labored in vain,
ISA.49.4	I have spent my strength for nothing and in vain;
ISA.49.4	Yet surely my just reward 
ISA.49.4	And my work with my God.’ ”
ISA.49.5	“And now the 
ISA.49.5	Who formed Me from the womb 
ISA.49.5	To bring Jacob back to Him,
ISA.49.5	So that Israel

ISA.49.6	And to restore the preserved ones of Israel;
ISA.49.6	I will also give You as a 
ISA.49.6	That You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”
ISA.49.7	Thus says the 
ISA.49.7	The Redeemer of Israel, their Holy One,
ISA.49.7	To Him whom man despises,
ISA.49.7	To Him whom the nation abhors,
ISA.49.7	To the Servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings shall see and arise,
ISA.49.7	Princes also shall worship,
ISA.49.7	Because of the 
ISA.49.7	The Holy One of Israel;
ISA.49.7	And He has chosen You.”
ISA.49.8	Thus says the 
ISA.49.8	“In an 
ISA.49.8	And in the day of salvation I have helped You;
ISA.49.8	I will preserve You 
ISA.49.8	As a covenant to the people,

ISA.49.12	Surely 
ISA.49.12	Look! Those from the north and the west,
ISA.49.12	And these from the land of Sinim.”
ISA.49.13	Sing, O heavens!

ISA.49.13	And break out in singing, O mountains!
ISA.49.13	For the

ISA.49.14	But Zion said, “The 
ISA.49.14	And my Lord has forgotten me.”
ISA.49.15	“Can
ISA.49.15	And not have compassion on the son of her womb?

ISA.49.20	The children you will have,
ISA.49.20	After you have lost the others,
ISA.49.20	Will say again in your ears,
ISA.49.20	‘The place 
ISA.49.20	Give me a place where I may dwell.’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your heart,

ISA.49.22	And your daughters shall be carried on 
ISA.49.23	Kings shall be your foster fathers,
ISA.49.23	And their queens your nursing mothers;
ISA.49.23	They shall bow down to you with 
ISA.49.23	And 
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I 
ISA.49.23	For they shall not be ashamed who wait for Me.”
ISA.49.24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty,
ISA.49.24	Or the captives of the righteous be delivered?
ISA.49.25	But thus says the 
ISA.49.25	“Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
ISA.49.25	And the prey of the terrible be delivered;
ISA.49.25	For I will contend with him who contends with you,
ISA.49.25	And I will save your children.
ISA.49.26	I will 
ISA.49.26	And they shall be drunk with their own 
ISA.49.26	All flesh 
ISA.49.26	That I, the 
ISA.49.26	And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
ISA.50.1	Thus says the 
ISA.50.1	“Where 
ISA.50.1	Whom I have put away?
ISA.50.1	Or which of My 
ISA.50.1	For your iniquities 
ISA.50.1	And for your transgressions your mother has been put away.
ISA.50.2	Why, when I came, 
ISA.50.2	 when I called, 
ISA.50.2	Is My hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem?
ISA.50.2	Or have I no power to deliver?
ISA.50.2	Indeed with My 
ISA.50.2	I make the rivers a wilderness;
ISA.50.2	Their fish stink because 
ISA.50.2	And die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness,
ISA.50.3	And I make sackcloth their covering.”
ISA.50.4	“The
ISA.50.4	The tongue of the learned,
ISA.50.4	That I should know how to speak
ISA.50.4	A word in season to 
ISA.50.4	He awakens Me morning by morning,
ISA.50.4	He awakens My ear
ISA.50.4	To hear as the learned.
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	And I was not 
ISA.50.5	Nor did I turn away.
ISA.50.6	I gave My back to those who struck 
ISA.50.6	And 
ISA.50.6	I did not hide My face from shame and 
ISA.50.7	“For the Lord 
ISA.50.7	Therefore I will not be disgraced;
ISA.50.7	Therefore 
ISA.50.7	And I know that I will not be ashamed.
ISA.50.8	Who will contend with Me?
ISA.50.8	Let us stand together.
ISA.50.8	Who 
ISA.50.8	Let him come near Me.
ISA.50.9	Surely the Lord 
ISA.50.9	Who 
ISA.50.9	Indeed they will all grow old like a garment;
ISA.50.9	The moth will eat them up.
ISA.50.10	“Who among you fears the 
ISA.50.10	Who obeys the voice of His Servant?
ISA.50.10	Who 
ISA.50.10	And has no light?
ISA.50.10	Let him trust in the name of the 
ISA.50.10	And rely upon his God.
ISA.50.11	Look, all you who kindle a fire,
ISA.50.11	Who encircle 
ISA.50.11	Walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks you have kindled—
ISA.50.11	This you shall have from My hand:
ISA.50.11	You shall lie down

ISA.51.1	You who seek the 
ISA.51.1	Look to the rock 
ISA.51.1	And to the hole of the pit 
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father,
ISA.51.2	And to Sarah

ISA.51.2	And 
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.3	He will comfort all her waste places;
ISA.51.3	He will make her wilderness like Eden,
ISA.51.3	And her desert 
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found in it,
ISA.51.3	Thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
ISA.51.4	“Listen to Me, My people;
ISA.51.4	And give ear to Me, O My nation:
ISA.51.4	For law will proceed from Me,
ISA.51.4	And I will make My justice rest
ISA.51.4	As a light of the peoples.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness 
ISA.51.5	My salvation has gone forth,
ISA.51.5	And My arms will judge the peoples;
ISA.51.5	The coastlands will wait upon Me,
ISA.51.5	And 
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
ISA.51.6	And look on the earth beneath.
ISA.51.6	For 
ISA.51.6	The earth will grow old like a garment,
ISA.51.6	And those who dwell in it will die in like manner;
ISA.51.6	But My salvation will be 
ISA.51.6	And My righteousness will not be abolished.
ISA.51.7	“Listen to Me, you who know righteousness,
ISA.51.7	You people 
ISA.51.7	Do not fear the reproach of men,
ISA.51.7	Nor be afraid of their insults.
ISA.51.8	For 
ISA.51.8	And the worm will eat them like wool;
ISA.51.8	But My righteousness will be forever,
ISA.51.8	And My salvation from generation to generation.”
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, 
ISA.51.9	O arm of the 
ISA.51.9	Awake 
ISA.51.9	In the generations of old.
ISA.51.9	 You not 
ISA.51.9	 wounded the 
ISA.51.10	 You not

ISA.51.10	That made the depths of the sea a road
ISA.51.10	For the redeemed to cross over?
ISA.51.11	So 
ISA.51.11	And come to Zion with singing,
ISA.51.11	With everlasting joy on their heads.
ISA.51.11	They shall obtain joy and gladness;
ISA.51.11	Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
ISA.51.12	“I,

ISA.51.12	And of the son of a man 
ISA.51.13	And 
ISA.51.13	Who stretched out the heavens
ISA.51.13	And laid the foundations of the earth;
ISA.51.13	You have feared continually every day
ISA.51.13	Because of the fury of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	When 
ISA.51.13	And where 
ISA.51.14	The captive exile hastens, that he may be loosed,
ISA.51.14	That he should not die in the pit,
ISA.51.14	And that his bread should not fail.
ISA.51.15	But I 
ISA.51.15	Who 
ISA.51.15	The 
ISA.51.16	And 
ISA.51.16	I have covered you with the shadow of My hand,

ISA.51.18	Among all the sons she has brought up.
ISA.51.19	These two 
ISA.51.19	Who will be sorry for you?—
ISA.51.19	Desolation and destruction, famine and sword—
ISA.51.19	By whom will I comfort you?
ISA.51.20	Your sons have fainted,
ISA.51.20	They lie at the head of all the streets,
ISA.51.20	Like an antelope in a net;
ISA.51.20	They are full of the fury of the 
ISA.51.20	The rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	Therefore please hear this, you afflicted,

ISA.51.22	Thus says your Lord,
ISA.51.22	The 
ISA.51.22	“See, I have taken out of your hand
ISA.51.22	The cup of trembling,
ISA.51.22	The dregs of the cup of My fury;
ISA.51.22	You shall no longer drink it.
ISA.51.23	But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,
ISA.51.23	Who have said to you,
ISA.51.23	‘Lie down, that we may walk over you.’
ISA.51.23	And you have laid your body like the ground,
ISA.51.23	And as the street, for those who walk over.”
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake!
ISA.52.1	Put on your strength, O Zion;
ISA.52.1	Put on your beautiful garments,
ISA.52.1	O Jerusalem, the holy city!
ISA.52.1	For the uncircumcised 
ISA.52.1	Shall no longer come to you.
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself from the dust, arise;
ISA.52.2	Sit down, O Jerusalem!
ISA.52.2	Loose yourself from the bonds of your neck,
ISA.52.2	O captive daughter of Zion!
ISA.52.3	For thus says the 
ISA.52.3	“You have sold yourselves for nothing,
ISA.52.3	And you shall be redeemed 
ISA.52.4	For thus says the Lord 
ISA.52.4	“My people went down at first
ISA.52.4	Into 
ISA.52.4	Then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what have I here,” says the 
ISA.52.5	“That My people are taken away for nothing?
ISA.52.5	Those who rule over them

ISA.52.12	And the God of Israel

ISA.52.13	He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.
ISA.52.14	Just as many were astonished at you,
ISA.52.14	So His 
ISA.52.14	And His form more than the sons of men;
ISA.52.15	So shall He sprinkle many nations.
ISA.52.15	Kings shall shut their mouths at Him;
ISA.52.15	For 
ISA.52.15	And what they had not heard they shall consider.
ISA.53.1	Who 
ISA.53.1	And to whom has the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant,
ISA.53.2	And as a root out of dry ground.
ISA.53.2	He has no form or comeliness;
ISA.53.2	And when we see Him,
ISA.53.3	He is despised and rejected by men,
ISA.53.3	A Man of sorrows and 
ISA.53.3	And we hid, as it were, 
ISA.53.3	He was despised, and 
ISA.53.4	Surely 
ISA.53.4	And carried our sorrows;
ISA.53.4	Yet we esteemed Him stricken,
ISA.53.4	Smitten by God, and afflicted.
ISA.53.5	But He 
ISA.53.5	The chastisement for our peace 
ISA.53.5	And by His 
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have gone astray;
ISA.53.6	We have turned, every one, to his own way;
ISA.53.6	And the 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
ISA.53.7	Yet 
ISA.53.7	He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,
ISA.53.7	And as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
ISA.53.7	So He opened not His mouth.
ISA.53.8	He was 
ISA.53.8	And who will declare His generation?
ISA.53.8	For 
ISA.53.8	For the transgressions of My people He was stricken.
ISA.53.9	And they made His grave with the wicked—
ISA.53.9	But with the rich at His death,
ISA.53.9	Because He had done no violence,
ISA.53.9	Nor 
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the 
ISA.53.10	He has put 
ISA.53.10	When You make His soul 
ISA.53.10	He shall see 
ISA.53.10	And the pleasure of the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see the labor of His soul, 
ISA.53.11	By His knowledge 
ISA.53.11	For He shall bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great,
ISA.53.12	And He shall divide the spoil with the strong,
ISA.53.12	Because He 
ISA.53.12	And He was 
ISA.53.12	And He bore the sin of many,
ISA.53.12	And 
ISA.54.1	“Sing, O 
ISA.54.1	You 
ISA.54.1	Break forth into singing, and cry aloud,
ISA.54.1	You 
ISA.54.1	For more

ISA.54.11	And lay your foundations with sapphires.

ISA.54.12	Your gates of crystal,
ISA.54.12	And all your walls of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	All your children 
ISA.54.13	And

ISA.55.3	And I will make an everlasting covenant with you—
ISA.55.3	The 
ISA.55.4	Indeed I have given him 
ISA.55.4	A leader and commander for the people.
ISA.55.5	Surely you shall call a nation you do not know,

ISA.57.14	Take the stumbling block out of the way of My people.”
ISA.57.15	For thus says the High and Lofty One
ISA.57.15	Who inhabits eternity, 
ISA.57.15	“I dwell in the high and holy 
ISA.57.15	With him 
ISA.57.15	To revive the spirit of the humble,
ISA.57.15	And to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend forever,
ISA.57.16	Nor will I always be angry;
ISA.57.16	For the spirit would fail before Me,
ISA.57.16	And the souls 
ISA.57.17	For the iniquity of 
ISA.57.17	I was angry and struck him;
ISA.57.17	I hid and was angry,
ISA.57.17	And he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, and 
ISA.57.18	I will also lead him,
ISA.57.18	And restore comforts to him
ISA.57.18	And to 
ISA.57.19	“I create 
ISA.57.19	Peace, peace

ISA.57.19	“And I will heal him.”
ISA.57.20	But the wicked 
ISA.57.20	When it cannot rest,
ISA.57.20	Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
ISA.57.21	“
ISA.57.21	Says my God, “for the wicked.”
ISA.58.1	“Cry aloud, spare not;
ISA.58.1	Lift up your voice like a trumpet;
ISA.58.1	Tell My people their transgression,
ISA.58.1	And the house of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek Me daily,
ISA.58.2	And delight to know My ways,
ISA.58.2	As a nation that did righteousness,
ISA.58.2	And did not forsake the ordinance of their God.
ISA.58.2	They ask of Me the ordinances of justice;
ISA.58.2	They take delight in approaching God.
ISA.58.3	‘Why
ISA.58.3	 have we

ISA.58.4	And to strike with the fist of wickedness.
ISA.58.4	You will not fast as 
ISA.58.4	To make your voice heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Is 
ISA.58.5	A day for a man to afflict his soul?
ISA.58.5	And 
ISA.58.5	Would you call this a fast,
ISA.58.5	And an acceptable day to the

ISA.58.6	To 
ISA.58.6	To undo the heavy burdens,
ISA.58.6	To let the oppressed go free,
ISA.58.6	And that you break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out;
ISA.58.7	When you see the naked, that you cover him,
ISA.58.7	And not hide yourself from 
ISA.58.8	Then your light shall break forth like the morning,
ISA.58.8	Your healing shall spring forth speedily,
ISA.58.8	And your righteousness shall go before you;
ISA.58.8	The glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then you shall call, and the 
ISA.58.9	You shall cry, and He will say, ‘Here I

ISA.58.9	The pointing of the finger, and 
ISA.58.10	 you extend your soul to the hungry

ISA.58.12	Those from among you

ISA.58.13	Nor speaking 
ISA.58.14	Then you shall delight yourself in the 
ISA.58.14	And I will cause you to 
ISA.58.14	And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.
ISA.58.14	The mouth of the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.1	That it cannot save;
ISA.59.1	Nor His ear heavy,
ISA.59.1	That it cannot hear.
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have separated you from your God;
ISA.59.2	And your sins have hidden 
ISA.59.2	So that He will 
ISA.59.3	For 
ISA.59.3	And your fingers with iniquity;
ISA.59.3	Your lips have spoken lies,
ISA.59.3	Your tongue has muttered perversity.
ISA.59.4	No one calls for justice,
ISA.59.4	Nor does 
ISA.59.4	They trust in 
ISA.59.4	They conceive evil and bring forth iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch vipers’ eggs and weave the spider’s web;
ISA.59.5	He who eats of their eggs dies,
ISA.59.5	And 
ISA.59.6	Their webs will not become garments,
ISA.59.6	Nor will they cover themselves with their works;
ISA.59.6	Their works 
ISA.59.6	And the act of violence 
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil,
ISA.59.7	And they make haste to shed 
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts 
ISA.59.7	Wasting and 
ISA.59.8	The way of 
ISA.59.8	And 
ISA.59.8	They have made themselves crooked paths;
ISA.59.8	Whoever takes that way shall not know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore justice is far from us,
ISA.59.9	Nor does righteousness overtake us;
ISA.59.9	We look for light, but there is darkness!
ISA.59.9	For brightness, 
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind,
ISA.59.10	And we grope as if 
ISA.59.10	We stumble at noonday as at twilight;
ISA.59.11	We all growl like bears,
ISA.59.11	And 
ISA.59.11	We look for justice, but 
ISA.59.11	For salvation, 
ISA.59.12	For our 
ISA.59.12	And our sins testify against us;
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions 
ISA.59.12	And 
ISA.59.13	In transgressing and lying against the 
ISA.59.13	And departing from our God,
ISA.59.13	Speaking oppression and revolt,
ISA.59.13	Conceiving and uttering 
ISA.59.14	Justice is turned back,
ISA.59.14	And righteousness stands afar off;
ISA.59.14	For truth is fallen in the street,
ISA.59.14	And equity cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	So truth fails,
ISA.59.15	And he 
ISA.59.15	Then the 
ISA.59.15	That 
ISA.59.16	He saw that 
ISA.59.16	And 
ISA.59.16	Therefore His own arm brought salvation for Him;
ISA.59.16	And His own righteousness, it sustained Him.
ISA.59.17	For He put on righteousness as a breastplate,
ISA.59.17	And a helmet of salvation on His head;
ISA.59.17	He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing,
ISA.59.17	And was clad with zeal as a cloak.
ISA.59.18	According to 
ISA.59.18	Fury to His adversaries,
ISA.59.18	Recompense to His enemies;
ISA.59.18	The coastlands He will fully repay.
ISA.59.19	So shall they fear
ISA.59.19	The name of the 
ISA.59.19	And His glory from the rising of the sun;
ISA.59.19	When the enemy comes in 
ISA.59.19	The Spirit of the

ISA.63.16	You, O

ISA.64.1	Oh, that You would rend the heavens!
ISA.64.1	That You would come down!
ISA.64.1	That the mountains might shake at Your

ISA.64.4	Who acts for the one who waits for Him.
ISA.64.5	You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,
ISA.64.5	 remembers You in Your ways.
ISA.64.5	You are indeed angry, for we have sinned—
ISA.64.5	In these ways we continue;
ISA.64.5	And we need to be saved.
ISA.64.6	But we are all like an unclean

ISA.64.7	And 
ISA.64.7	Who stirs himself up to take hold of You;
ISA.64.7	For You have hidden Your face from us,
ISA.64.7	And have consumed us because of our iniquities.
ISA.64.8	But now, O 
ISA.64.8	You

ISA.64.8	And all we 
ISA.64.9	Do not be furious, O 
ISA.64.9	Nor remember iniquity forever;

ISA.65.12	Therefore I will number you for the sword,
ISA.65.12	And you shall all bow down to the slaughter;
ISA.65.12	Because, when I called, you did not answer;
ISA.65.12	When I spoke, you did not hear,
ISA.65.12	But did evil before My eyes,

ISA.65.16	So that he who blesses himself in the earth
ISA.65.16	Shall bless himself in the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	And 
ISA.65.16	Shall swear by the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	Because the former troubles are forgotten,
ISA.65.16	And because they are hidden from My eyes.
ISA.65.17	“For behold, I create 
ISA.65.17	And the former shall not be remembered or come to mind.

ISA.66.8	Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day?
ISA.66.8	 shall a nation be born at once?
ISA.66.8	For as soon as Zion was in labor,
ISA.66.8	She gave birth to her children.

JER.1.17	Lest I dismay you before them.

JER.2.24	All those who seek her will not weary themselves;
JER.2.24	In her month they will find her.
JER.2.25	Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst.
JER.2.25	But you said, 
JER.2.25	No! For I have loved

JER.4.7	The lion has come up from his thicket,
JER.4.7	And 
JER.4.7	He has gone forth from his place
JER.4.7	To make your land desolate.
JER.4.7	Your cities will be laid waste,
JER.4.7	Without inhabitant.

JER.4.9	“
JER.4.9	And the heart of the princes;

JER.4.10	Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem,
JER.4.10	Saying, ‘You shall have peace,’
JER.4.10	Whereas the sword reaches to the heart.”
JER.4.11	At that time it will be said
JER.4.11	To this people and to Jerusalem,
JER.4.11	“A dry wind of the desolate heights

JER.4.14	That you may be saved.
JER.4.14	How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?
JER.4.15	For a voice declares 
JER.4.15	And proclaims affliction from Mount Ephraim:

JER.4.19	My heart makes a noise in me;
JER.4.19	I cannot hold my peace,
JER.4.19	Because you have heard, O my soul,
JER.4.19	The sound of the trumpet,
JER.4.19	The alarm of war.
JER.4.20	Destruction upon destruction is cried,
JER.4.20	For the whole land is plundered.

JER.4.21	How long will I see the standard,
JER.4.21	 hear the sound of the trumpet?
JER.4.22	“For My people 
JER.4.22	They have not known Me.

JER.4.25	And 
JER.4.26	I beheld, and indeed the fruitful land 
JER.4.26	And all its cities were broken down
JER.4.26	At the presence of the 
JER.4.26	By His fierce anger.
JER.4.27	For thus says the 
JER.4.27	“The whole land shall be desolate;
JER.4.27	Yet I will not make a full end.
JER.4.28	For this 
JER.4.28	And 
JER.4.28	Because I have spoken.
JER.4.28	I have 
JER.4.28	Nor will I turn back from it.
JER.4.29	The whole city shall flee from the noise of the horsemen and bowmen.
JER.4.29	They shall go into thickets and climb up on the rocks.
JER.4.29	Every city 
JER.4.29	And not a man shall dwell in it.
JER.4.30	“And 
JER.4.30	What will you do?
JER.4.30	Though you clothe yourself with crimson,
JER.4.30	Though you adorn 
JER.4.30	Though you enlarge your eyes with paint,
JER.4.30	In vain you will make yourself fair;
JER.4.30	 lovers will despise you;
JER.4.30	They will seek your life.
JER.4.31	“For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	The anguish as of her who brings forth her first child,
JER.4.31	The voice of the daughter of Zion bewailing herself;
JER.4.31	She 
JER.4.31	‘Woe 
JER.4.31	Because of murderers!’
JER.5.1	“Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem;
JER.5.1	See now and know;
JER.5.1	And seek in her open places
JER.5.1	If you can find a man,
JER.5.1	If there is 
JER.5.1	Who seeks the truth,
JER.5.1	And I will pardon her.
JER.5.2	Though they say, ‘
JER.5.2	Surely they 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.3	You have 
JER.5.3	But they have not grieved;
JER.5.3	You have consumed them,
JER.5.3	But 
JER.5.3	They have made their faces harder than rock;
JER.5.3	They have refused to return.
JER.5.4	Therefore I said, “Surely these 
JER.5.4	They are foolish;
JER.5.4	For 
JER.5.4	The judgment of their God.
JER.5.5	I will go to the great men and speak to them,
JER.5.5	For 
JER.5.5	The judgment of their God.”
JER.5.5	But these have altogether 
JER.5.5	 burst the bonds.
JER.5.6	Therefore 
JER.5.6	A wolf of the deserts shall destroy them;
JER.5.6	A leopard will watch over their cities.
JER.5.6	Everyone who goes out from there shall be torn in pieces,
JER.5.6	Because their transgressions are many;
JER.5.6	Their backslidings have increased.
JER.5.7	“How shall I pardon you for this?
JER.5.7	Your children have forsaken Me
JER.5.7	And 
JER.5.7	When I had fed them to the full,
JER.5.7	Then they committed adultery
JER.5.7	And assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.
JER.5.8	They were 
JER.5.8	Every one neighed after his neighbor’s wife.
JER.5.9	Shall I not punish 
JER.5.9	“And shall I not 
JER.5.10	“Go up on her walls and destroy,
JER.5.10	But do not make a 
JER.5.10	Take away her branches,
JER.5.10	For they 
JER.5.11	For 
JER.5.11	Have dealt very treacherously with Me,” says the 
JER.5.12	They have lied about the 
JER.5.12	And said, 
JER.5.12	Neither will evil come upon us,
JER.5.12	Nor shall we see sword or famine.
JER.5.13	And the prophets become wind,
JER.5.13	For the word 
JER.5.13	Thus shall it be done to them.”
JER.5.14	Therefore thus says the 
JER.5.14	“Because you speak this word,
JER.5.14	Behold, I will make My words in your mouth fire,
JER.5.14	And this people wood,
JER.5.14	And it shall devour them.
JER.5.15	Behold, I will bring a 
JER.5.15	O house of Israel,” says the 
JER.5.15	“It 
JER.5.15	It 
JER.5.15	A nation whose language you do not know,
JER.5.15	Nor can you understand what they say.
JER.5.16	Their quiver 
JER.5.16	They 
JER.5.17	And they shall eat up your 
JER.5.17	 your sons and daughters should eat.
JER.5.17	They shall eat up your flocks and your herds;
JER.5.17	They shall eat up your vines and your fig trees;
JER.5.17	They shall destroy your fortified cities,
JER.5.17	In which you trust, with the sword.
JER.5.18	“Nevertheless in those days,” says the 
JER.5.19	And it will be when you say, 
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob
JER.5.20	And proclaim it in Judah, saying,
JER.5.21	‘Hear this now, O 
JER.5.21	Without understanding,
JER.5.21	Who have eyes and see not,
JER.5.21	And who have ears and hear not:
JER.5.22	Do you not fear Me?’ says the 
JER.5.22	‘Will you not tremble at My presence,
JER.5.22	Who have placed the sand as the 
JER.5.22	By a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass beyond it?
JER.5.22	And though its waves toss to and fro,
JER.5.22	Yet they cannot prevail;
JER.5.22	Though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it.
JER.5.23	But this people has a defiant and rebellious heart;
JER.5.23	They have revolted and departed.
JER.5.24	They do not say in their heart,
JER.5.24	“Let us now fear the 
JER.5.24	Who gives rain, both the 
JER.5.24	He reserves for us the appointed weeks of the harvest.”
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned these 
JER.5.25	And your sins have withheld good from you.
JER.5.26	‘For among My people are found wicked 
JER.5.26	They 
JER.5.26	They set a trap;
JER.5.26	They catch men.
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds,
JER.5.27	So their houses 
JER.5.27	Therefore they have become great and grown rich.
JER.5.28	They have grown 
JER.5.28	Yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked;
JER.5.28	They do not plead 
JER.5.28	The cause of the fatherless;
JER.5.28	Yet they prosper,
JER.5.28	And the right of the needy they do not defend.
JER.5.29	Shall I not punish 
JER.5.29	‘Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?’
JER.5.30	“An astonishing and 
JER.5.30	Has been committed in the land:
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy 
JER.5.31	And the priests rule by their 
JER.5.31	And My people 
JER.5.31	But what will you do in the end?
JER.6.1	“O you children of Benjamin,
JER.6.1	Gather yourselves to flee from the midst of Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Blow the trumpet in Tekoa,
JER.6.1	And set up a signal-fire in 
JER.6.1	For disaster appears out of the north,
JER.6.1	And great destruction.
JER.6.2	I have likened the daughter of Zion
JER.6.2	To a lovely and delicate woman.
JER.6.3	The 
JER.6.3	They shall pitch 
JER.6.3	Each one shall pasture in his own place.”
JER.6.4	“Prepare
JER.6.4	Arise, and let us go up 
JER.6.4	Woe to us, for the day goes away,
JER.6.4	For the shadows of the evening are lengthening.
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us go by night,
JER.6.5	And let us destroy her palaces.”
JER.6.6	For thus has the 
JER.6.6	“Cut down trees,
JER.6.6	And build a mound against Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This 
JER.6.6	She 
JER.6.7	As a fountain wells up with water,
JER.6.7	So she wells up with her wickedness.
JER.6.7	Violence and plundering are heard in her.
JER.6.7	Before Me continually 
JER.6.8	Be instructed, O Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	Lest 
JER.6.8	Lest I make you desolate,
JER.6.8	A land not inhabited.”
JER.6.9	Thus says the 
JER.6.9	“They shall thoroughly glean as a vine the remnant of Israel;
JER.6.9	As a grape-gatherer, put your hand back into the branches.”
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak and give warning,
JER.6.10	That they may hear?
JER.6.10	Indeed their 
JER.6.10	And they cannot give heed.
JER.6.10	Behold, 
JER.6.10	They have no delight in it.
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the 
JER.6.11	I am weary of holding 
JER.6.11	“I will pour it out 
JER.6.11	And on the assembly of young men together;
JER.6.11	For even the husband shall be taken with the wife,
JER.6.11	The aged with 
JER.6.12	And 
JER.6.12	Fields and wives together;
JER.6.12	For I will stretch out My hand
JER.6.12	Against the inhabitants of the land,” says the 
JER.6.13	“Because from the least of them even to the greatest of them,
JER.6.13	Everyone 
JER.6.13	And from the prophet even to the 
JER.6.13	Everyone deals falsely.
JER.6.14	They have also 
JER.6.14	Saying, ‘Peace, peace!’
JER.6.14	When 
JER.6.15	Were they 
JER.6.15	No! They were not at all ashamed;
JER.6.15	Nor did they know how to blush.
JER.6.15	Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;
JER.6.15	At the time I punish them,
JER.6.15	They shall be cast down,” says the 
JER.6.16	Thus says the 
JER.6.16	“Stand in the ways and see,
JER.6.16	And ask for the 
JER.6.16	And walk in it;
JER.6.16	Then you will find 
JER.6.16	But they said, ‘We will not walk 
JER.6.17	Also, I set 
JER.6.17	‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’
JER.6.17	But they said, ‘We will not listen.’
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, you nations,
JER.6.18	And know, O congregation, what 
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth!
JER.6.19	Behold, I will certainly bring 
JER.6.19	The fruit of their thoughts,
JER.6.19	Because they have not heeded My words
JER.6.19	Nor My law, but rejected it.
JER.6.20	For what purpose to Me
JER.6.20	Comes frankincense 
JER.6.20	And 
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings 
JER.6.20	Nor your sacrifices sweet to Me.”
JER.6.21	Therefore thus says the 
JER.6.21	“Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people,
JER.6.21	And the fathers and the sons together shall fall on them.
JER.6.21	The neighbor and his friend shall perish.”
JER.6.22	Thus says the 
JER.6.22	“Behold, a people comes from the 
JER.6.22	And a great nation will be raised from the farthest parts of the earth.
JER.6.23	They will lay hold on bow and spear;
JER.6.23	They 
JER.6.23	Their voice 
JER.6.23	And they ride on horses,
JER.6.23	As men of war set in array against you, O daughter of Zion.”
JER.6.24	We have heard the report of it;
JER.6.24	Our hands grow feeble.
JER.6.24	Anguish has taken hold of us,
JER.6.24	Pain as of a woman in labor.
JER.6.25	Do not go out into the field,
JER.6.25	Nor walk by the way.
JER.6.25	Because of the sword of the enemy,
JER.6.25	Fear 
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people,
JER.6.26	Dress in sackcloth
JER.6.26	And roll about in ashes!
JER.6.26	Make mourning 
JER.6.26	For the plunderer will suddenly come upon us.
JER.6.27	“I have set you 
JER.6.27	That you may know and test their way.
JER.6.28	They 
JER.6.28	They 
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely,
JER.6.29	The lead is consumed by the fire;
JER.6.29	The smelter refines in vain,
JER.6.29	For the wicked are not drawn off.
JER.6.30	 will call them 
JER.6.30	Because the 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	“Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus says the 
JER.7.4	Do not trust in these lying words, saying, ‘The temple of the 
JER.7.5	“For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly 
JER.7.6	 you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, 
JER.7.7	then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in 
JER.7.8	“Behold, you trust in 
JER.7.9	Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and 
JER.7.10	and 
JER.7.11	Has 
JER.7.12	“But go now to 
JER.7.13	And now, because you have done all these works,” says the 
JER.7.14	therefore I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to this place which I gave to you and your fathers, as I have done to 
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of My sight, 
JER.7.16	“Therefore 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and 
JER.7.19	Do they provoke Me to anger?” says the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus says the Lord 
JER.7.21	Thus says the 
JER.7.22	For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. 
JER.7.23	But this is what I commanded them, saying, 
JER.7.24	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have even 
JER.7.26	Yet they did not obey Me or incline their ear, but 
JER.7.27	“Therefore 
JER.7.28	“So you shall say to them, ‘This 
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair and cast 
JER.7.30	For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight,” says the 
JER.7.31	And they have built the 
JER.7.32	“Therefore behold, 
JER.7.33	The 
JER.7.34	Then I will cause to 
JER.8.1	“At that time,” says the 
JER.8.2	They shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked, which they have sought and 
JER.8.3	Then 
JER.8.4	“Moreover you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.8.4	“Will they fall and not rise?
JER.8.4	Will one turn away and not return?
JER.8.5	Why has this people 
JER.8.5	Jerusalem, in a perpetual backsliding?
JER.8.5	They hold fast to deceit,
JER.8.5	They refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I listened and heard,
JER.8.6	 they do not speak aright.
JER.8.6	No man repented of his wickedness,
JER.8.6	Saying, ‘What have I done?’
JER.8.6	Everyone turned to his own course,
JER.8.6	As the horse rushes into the battle.
JER.8.7	“Even 
JER.8.7	Knows her appointed times;
JER.8.7	And the turtledove, the swift, and the swallow
JER.8.7	Observe the time of their coming.
JER.8.7	But 
JER.8.8	“How can you say, ‘We 
JER.8.8	And the law of the 
JER.8.8	Look, the false pen of the scribe certainly works falsehood.
JER.8.9	The wise men are ashamed,
JER.8.9	They are dismayed and taken.
JER.8.9	Behold, they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.9	So 
JER.8.10	Therefore 
JER.8.10	 their fields to those who will inherit 
JER.8.10	Because from the least even to the greatest
JER.8.10	Everyone is given to 
JER.8.10	From the prophet even to the priest
JER.8.10	Everyone deals falsely.
JER.8.11	For they have 
JER.8.11	Saying, 
JER.8.11	When 
JER.8.12	Were they 
JER.8.12	No! They were not at all ashamed,
JER.8.12	Nor did they know how to blush.
JER.8.12	Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;
JER.8.12	In the time of their punishment
JER.8.12	They shall be cast down,” says the 
JER.8.13	“I will surely consume them,” says the 
JER.8.13	“No grapes 
JER.8.13	Nor figs on the 
JER.8.13	And the leaf shall fade;
JER.8.13	And 
JER.8.14	“Why do we sit still?
JER.8.14	Assemble yourselves,
JER.8.14	And let us enter the fortified cities,
JER.8.14	And let us be silent there.
JER.8.14	For the 
JER.8.14	And given us 
JER.8.14	Because we have sinned against the 
JER.8.15	“
JER.8.15	And for a time of health, and there was trouble!
JER.8.16	The snorting of His horses was heard from 
JER.8.16	The whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of His 
JER.8.16	For they have come and devoured the land and all that is in it,
JER.8.16	The city and those who dwell in it.”
JER.8.17	“For behold, I will send serpents among you,
JER.8.17	Vipers which cannot be 
JER.8.17	And they shall bite you,” says the 
JER.8.18	I would comfort myself in sorrow;
JER.8.18	My heart 
JER.8.19	Listen! The voice,
JER.8.19	The cry of the daughter of my people
JER.8.19	From 
JER.8.19	“
JER.8.19	 not her King in her?”
JER.8.19	“Why have they provoked Me to anger
JER.8.19	With their carved images—
JER.8.19	With foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	“The harvest is past,
JER.8.20	The summer is ended,
JER.8.20	And we are not saved!”
JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am hurt.
JER.8.21	I am 
JER.8.21	Astonishment has taken hold of me.
JER.8.22	Why then is there no recovery
JER.8.22	For the health of the daughter of my people?
JER.9.1	Oh, 
JER.9.1	And my eyes a fountain of tears,
JER.9.1	That I might weep day and night
JER.9.1	For the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	Oh, that I had in the wilderness
JER.9.2	A lodging place for travelers;
JER.9.2	That I might leave my people,
JER.9.2	And go from them!
JER.9.2	For 
JER.9.2	An assembly of treacherous men.
JER.9.3	“And 
JER.9.3	They are not valiant for the truth on the earth.
JER.9.3	For they proceed from 
JER.9.3	And they

JER.9.4	For every brother will utterly supplant,
JER.9.4	And every neighbor will 
JER.9.5	Everyone will 
JER.9.5	And will not speak the truth;
JER.9.5	They have taught their tongue to speak lies;
JER.9.5	They weary themselves to commit iniquity.
JER.9.6	Your dwelling place 
JER.9.6	Through deceit they refuse to know Me,” says the 
JER.9.7	Therefore thus says the 
JER.9.7	“Behold, 
JER.9.7	For how shall I deal with the daughter of My people?
JER.9.8	Their tongue 
JER.9.8	It speaks

JER.9.8	But in his heart he lies in wait.
JER.9.9	Shall I not punish them for these 
JER.9.9	“Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?”
JER.9.10	I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains,
JER.9.10	And 
JER.9.10	Because they are burned up,
JER.9.10	So that no one can pass through;
JER.9.10	Nor can

JER.9.13	And the

JER.9.15	therefore thus says the 
JER.9.16	I will

JER.9.17	“Consider and call for 
JER.9.17	That they may come;
JER.9.17	And send for skillful 
JER.9.17	That they may come.
JER.9.18	Let them make haste
JER.9.18	And take up a wailing for us,
JER.9.18	That

JER.9.22	‘Even the carcasses of men shall fall 
JER.9.22	Like cuttings after the harvester,
JER.9.22	And no one shall gather

JER.10.2	Thus says the 
JER.10.2	“Do not learn the way of the Gentiles;
JER.10.2	Do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven,
JER.10.2	For the Gentiles are dismayed at them.
JER.10.3	For the customs of the peoples 
JER.10.3	For 
JER.10.3	The work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.
JER.10.4	They decorate it with silver and gold;
JER.10.4	They 
JER.10.4	So that it will not topple.
JER.10.5	They 
JER.10.5	And 
JER.10.5	They must be 
JER.10.5	Because they cannot go

JER.10.6	Inasmuch as

JER.10.10	He 
JER.10.10	At His wrath the earth will tremble,

JER.10.11	Thus you shall say to them:

JER.10.19	Woe is me for my hurt!
JER.10.19	My wound is severe.
JER.10.19	But I say, 
JER.10.19	And 
JER.10.20	My tent is plundered,
JER.10.20	And all my cords are broken;
JER.10.20	My children have gone from me,

JER.10.24	O 
JER.10.24	Not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.
JER.10.25	Pour out Your fury on the Gentiles, 
JER.10.25	And on the families who do not call on Your name;

JER.10.25	And made his dwelling place desolate.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
JER.11.3	and say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, 
JER.11.5	that I may establish the 
JER.11.5	And I answered and said, “So be it, 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly exhorted your fathers in the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, 
JER.11.8	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but 
JER.11.9	And the 
JER.11.10	They have turned back to

JER.11.16	Green Olive Tree, Lovely 
JER.11.16	With the noise of a great tumult

JER.11.20	You who judge righteously,
JER.11.20	Testing the mind and the heart,

JER.11.23	and there shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring catastrophe on the men of Anathoth, 
JER.12.1	Righteous 
JER.12.1	Yet let me talk with You about 
JER.12.1	Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
JER.12.1	 are those happy who deal so treacherously?
JER.12.2	You have planted them, yes, they have taken root;
JER.12.2	They grow, yes, they bear fruit.
JER.12.2	You 
JER.12.2	But far from their mind.
JER.12.3	But You, O 
JER.12.3	You have seen me,
JER.12.3	And You have 
JER.12.3	Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
JER.12.3	And prepare them for 
JER.12.4	How long will 
JER.12.4	And the herbs of every field wither?
JER.12.4	The beasts and birds are consumed,
JER.12.4	For the wickedness of those who dwell there,
JER.12.4	Because they said, “He will not see our final end.”
JER.12.5	“If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you,
JER.12.5	Then how can you contend with horses?
JER.12.5	And 
JER.12.5	Then how will you do in 
JER.12.6	For even 
JER.12.6	Even they have dealt treacherously with you;
JER.12.6	Yes, they have called a multitude after you.
JER.12.6	Do not believe them,
JER.12.6	Even though they speak smooth words to you.
JER.12.7	“I have forsaken My house, I have left My heritage;
JER.12.7	I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.
JER.12.8	My heritage is to Me like a lion in the forest;

JER.12.9	My heritage

JER.12.11	They have made it 
JER.12.11	Desolate, it mourns to Me;
JER.12.11	The whole land is made desolate,
JER.12.11	Because 
JER.12.12	The plunderers have come
JER.12.12	On all the desolate heights in the wilderness,
JER.12.12	For the sword of the 
JER.12.12	From 
JER.12.12	No flesh shall have peace.
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat but reaped thorns;
JER.12.13	They have put themselves to pain 
JER.12.13	But be ashamed of your harvest
JER.12.13	Because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.12.14	Thus says the 
JER.12.15	Then it shall be, after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them 
JER.12.16	And it shall be, if they will learn carefully the ways of My people,

JER.13.1	Thus the 
JER.13.2	So I got a sash according to the word of the

JER.13.4	“Take the sash that you acquired, which 
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	Now it came to pass after many days that the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the sash from the place where I had hidden it; and there was the sash, ruined. It was profitable for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	“Thus says the 
JER.13.10	This evil people, who

JER.13.20	Where

JER.13.21	For you have taught them
JER.13.21	Will not 
JER.13.21	Like a woman in labor?
JER.13.22	And if you say in your heart,
JER.13.22	“Why have these things come upon me?”
JER.13.22	For the greatness of your iniquity
JER.13.22	Your skirts have been uncovered,
JER.13.22	Your heels made bare.
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots?
JER.13.23	 may you also do good who are accustomed to do evil.
JER.13.24	“Therefore I will

JER.13.25	“Because you have forgotten Me

JER.13.26	Therefore 
JER.13.26	That your shame may appear.
JER.13.27	I have seen your adulteries
JER.13.27	And your 
JER.13.27	The lewdness of your harlotry,
JER.13.27	Your abominations 
JER.13.27	Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	Will you still not be made clean?”
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	“Judah mourns,
JER.14.2	And 
JER.14.2	They 
JER.14.2	And 
JER.14.3	Their nobles have sent their lads for water;
JER.14.3	They went to the cisterns 
JER.14.3	They returned with their vessels empty;
JER.14.3	They were 
JER.14.3	And covered their heads.
JER.14.4	Because the ground is parched,
JER.14.4	For there was 
JER.14.4	The plowmen were ashamed;
JER.14.4	They covered their heads.
JER.14.5	Yes, the deer also gave birth in the field,
JER.14.5	But left because there was no grass.
JER.14.6	And 
JER.14.6	They sniffed at the wind like jackals;
JER.14.6	Their eyes failed because 
JER.14.7	O 
JER.14.7	Do it 
JER.14.7	For our backslidings are many,
JER.14.7	We have sinned against You.
JER.14.8	O the Hope of Israel, his Savior in time of trouble,
JER.14.8	Why should You be like a stranger in the land,
JER.14.8	And like a traveler 
JER.14.9	Why should You be like a man astonished,
JER.14.9	Like a mighty one 
JER.14.9	Yet You, O 
JER.14.9	And we are called by Your name;

JER.14.10	And punish their sins.”
JER.14.11	Then the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and 
JER.14.13	Then I said, “Ah, Lord 
JER.14.14	And the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword;

JER.18.21	Let their wives 
JER.18.21	And 
JER.18.21	Let their men be put to death,
JER.18.21	Their young men 
JER.18.21	By the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses,
JER.18.22	When You bring a troop suddenly upon them;
JER.18.22	For they have dug a pit to take me,
JER.18.22	And hidden snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.18.23	Which is against me, to slay 
JER.18.23	Provide no atonement for their iniquity,
JER.18.23	Nor blot out their sin from Your sight;
JER.18.23	But let them be overthrown before You.
JER.18.23	Deal 
JER.18.23	In the time of Your

JER.19.2	And go out to 
JER.19.3	and say, ‘Hear the word of the

JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place,

JER.20.5	Moreover I

JER.20.7	You are stronger than I, and have prevailed.
JER.20.7	I am in derision daily;
JER.20.7	Everyone mocks me.
JER.20.8	For when I spoke, I cried out;
JER.20.8	I shouted, “Violence and plunder!”
JER.20.8	Because the word of the 
JER.20.8	A reproach and a derision daily.
JER.20.9	Then I said, “I will not make mention of Him,
JER.20.9	Nor speak anymore in His name.”
JER.20.9	But 
JER.20.9	Shut up in my bones;
JER.20.9	I was weary of holding 
JER.20.9	And 
JER.20.10	For I heard many mocking:
JER.20.10	“Fear on every side!”
JER.20.10	“Report,” 
JER.20.10	All my acquaintances watched for my stumbling, 
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he can be induced;
JER.20.10	Then we will prevail against him,
JER.20.10	And we will take our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	Therefore my persecutors will stumble, and will not 
JER.20.11	They will be greatly ashamed, for they will not prosper.
JER.20.12	But, O 
JER.20.12	You who 
JER.20.12	 see the mind and heart,
JER.20.12	Let me see Your vengeance on them;

JER.20.18	That my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	“Please inquire of the

JER.21.13	“Who say,

JER.22.2	and say, 
JER.22.3	Thus says the 
JER.22.4	For if you indeed do this thing, 
JER.22.5	But if you will not hear these words,

JER.23.20	In the latter days you will understand it perfectly.
JER.23.21	“I

JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till they are consumed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’ ”
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, 
JER.25.2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: 
JER.25.3	“From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, this 
JER.25.4	And the 
JER.25.5	They said, 
JER.25.6	Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not harm you.’ 
JER.25.7	Yet you have not listened to Me,” says the 
JER.25.8	“Therefore thus says the 
JER.25.9	behold, I will send and take 
JER.25.10	Moreover I will take from them the 
JER.25.11	And this whole land shall be a desolation 
JER.25.12	‘Then it will come to pass, 
JER.25.13	So I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied concerning all the nations. 
JER.25.14	(For many nations 
JER.25.15	For thus says the 
JER.25.16	And 
JER.25.17	Then I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its princes, to make them

JER.25.38	And because of His fierce anger.”
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the 
JER.26.2	“Thus says the 
JER.26.3	Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way, that I may

JER.26.5	to heed the words of My servants the prophets 
JER.26.6	then I will make this house like 
JER.26.7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	Now it happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why have you prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the 
JER.26.11	And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people, saying, “This man deserves to

JER.26.13	Now therefore, 
JER.26.14	As for me, here 
JER.26.15	But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the 
JER.26.16	So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying: 
JER.26.18	“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus says the 
JER.26.18	“Zion shall be plowed 
JER.26.18	Jerusalem shall become 
JER.26.18	And the mountain of the temple
JER.26.18	Like the bare hills of the forest.” ’
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death? 
JER.26.20	Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Urijah heard 
JER.26.22	Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and 
JER.26.23	And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
JER.26.24	Nevertheless 
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, 
JER.27.2	“Thus says the 
JER.27.3	and send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
JER.27.4	And command them to say to their masters, “Thus says the 
JER.27.5	‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that

JER.27.8	And it shall be, 
JER.27.9	Therefore do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon.” 
JER.27.10	For they prophesy a 
JER.27.11	But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land,’ says the 
JER.27.12	I also spoke to 
JER.27.13	Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	Therefore 
JER.27.15	for I have 
JER.27.16	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the 
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city be laid waste?

JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away

JER.28.4	And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon,’ says the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the 
JER.28.6	and the prophet Jeremiah said, 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 
JER.28.8	The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms—of war and disaster and pestilence. 
JER.28.9	As for 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the 
JER.28.11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the 
JER.28.12	Now the word of the 
JER.28.13	“Go and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the 
JER.28.14	For thus says the

JER.36.11	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the 
JER.36.12	he then went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and there all the princes were sitting—
JER.36.13	Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people. 
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. 
JER.36.15	And they said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read 
JER.36.16	Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, that they looked in fear from one to another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” 
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words—at his instruction?”
JER.36.18	So Baruch answered them, “He proclaimed with his mouth all these words to me, and I wrote 
JER.36.19	Then the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no one know where you are.”
JER.36.20	And they went to the king, into the court; but they stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the hearing of the king. 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll, and he took it from Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	Now the king was sitting in 
JER.36.23	And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four columns,

JER.36.25	Nevertheless Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah implored the king not to burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the 
JER.36.27	Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch had written at the instruction of Jeremiah, the word of the 
JER.36.28	“Take yet another scroll, and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.

JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the instruction of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And besides, there were added to them many similar words.
JER.37.1	Now King

JER.37.9	Thus says the 
JER.37.10	For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained 
JER.37.11	And it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans left 
JER.37.12	that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people. 
JER.37.13	And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard 
JER.37.14	Then Jeremiah said, “False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But he did not listen to him.
JER.37.14	So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. 
JER.37.15	Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him 
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah entered 
JER.37.17	then Zedekiah the king sent and took him 
JER.37.17	And Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What offense have I committed against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where now 
JER.37.20	Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king. Please, let my petition be accepted before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”
JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah 
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, 
JER.38.2	“Thus says the 
JER.38.3	Thus says the 
JER.38.4	Therefore the princes said to the king, “Please, 
JER.38.5	Then Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he 
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the king’s son, which 
JER.38.7	Now Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon. When the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin, 
JER.38.8	Ebed-Melech went out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying: 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon, and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is. For 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.” 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
JER.38.12	Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Please put these old clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained 
JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance of the house of the 
JER.38.15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare 
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the 
JER.38.18	But if you do not surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; they shall burn it with fire, and 
JER.38.19	And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have 
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, “They shall not deliver 
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to surrender, this 
JER.38.22	‘Now behold, all the 
JER.38.22	“Your close friends have set upon you
JER.38.22	And prevailed against you;
JER.38.22	Your feet have sunk in the mire,
JER.38.22	 they have turned away again.”
JER.38.23	‘So they shall surrender all your wives and 
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. 
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and also what the king said to you; do not hide 
JER.38.26	then you shall say to them, 
JER.38.27	Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been heard. 
JER.38.28	Now 
JER.39.1	In the 
JER.39.2	In the 
JER.39.3	Then all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer, Rabmag, with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
JER.39.4	So it was, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled and went out of the city by night, by way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out by way of the plain. 
JER.39.5	But the Chaldean army pursued them and 
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his 
JER.39.7	Moreover 
JER.39.8	And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people with 
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the 
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, 
JER.39.12	“Take him and look after him, and do him no 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s chief officers; 
JER.39.14	then they sent 
JER.39.15	Meanwhile the word of the 
JER.39.16	“Go and speak to 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver you in that day,” says the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but 
JER.40.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and 
JER.40.3	Now the 
JER.40.4	And now look, I free you this day from the chains that 
JER.40.5	Now while Jeremiah had not yet gone back, 
JER.40.6	Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to 
JER.40.7	And when all the captains of the armies who 
JER.40.8	then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—
JER.40.9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath before them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be 
JER.40.10	As for me, I will indeed dwell at Mizpah and serve the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, put 
JER.40.11	Likewise, when all the Jews who 
JER.40.12	then all the Jews 
JER.40.13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Do you certainly know that 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go, please, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely concerning Ishmael.”
JER.41.1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month 
JER.41.2	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, 
JER.41.4	And it happened, on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when as yet no one knew 
JER.41.5	that certain men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men 
JER.41.6	Now Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went along; and it happened as he met them that he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” 
JER.41.7	So it was, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah 
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.” So he desisted and did not kill them among their brethren. 
JER.41.9	Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, because of Gedaliah, 
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the 
JER.41.11	But when 
JER.41.12	they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah; and they found him by 
JER.41.13	So it was, when all the people who 
JER.41.14	Then all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took from Mizpah all the 
JER.41.17	And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of 
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, 
JER.42.1	Now all the captains of the forces, 
JER.42.2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, 
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Indeed, I will pray to the 
JER.42.5	So they said to Jeremiah, 
JER.42.6	Whether 
JER.42.7	And it happened after ten days that the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces which 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “Thus says the 
JER.42.10	‘If you will still remain in this land, then 
JER.42.11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him,’ says the 
JER.42.12	And 
JER.42.13	“But if

JER.42.16	then it shall be 
JER.42.17	So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And 
JER.42.18	“For thus says the 
JER.42.19	“The 
JER.42.20	For you were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the 
JER.42.21	And I have this day declared 
JER.42.22	Now therefore, know certainly that you 
JER.43.1	Now it happened, when Jeremiah had stopped speaking to all the people all the 
JER.43.2	that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely! The 
JER.43.3	But 
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people would 
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took 
JER.43.6	men, women, children, 
JER.43.7	So they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the

JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger, in that they went 
JER.44.4	However 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods. 
JER.44.6	So My fury and My anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted 
JER.44.7	“Now therefore, thus says the 
JER.44.8	in that you 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They have not been

JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there, and

JER.44.14	so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall escape or survive, lest they return to the land of Judah, to which they 
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, with all the women who stood by, a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: 
JER.44.16	“
JER.44.17	But we will certainly do 
JER.44.18	But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people—the men, the women, and all the people who had given him 
JER.44.21	“The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the 
JER.44.22	So the 
JER.44.23	Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the

JER.48.30	“I know his wrath,” says the 
JER.48.30	“But it 
JER.48.30	His lies have made nothing right.
JER.48.31	Therefore 
JER.48.31	And I will cry out for all Moab;
JER.48.31	I will mourn for the men of Kir Heres.
JER.48.32	O vine of Sibmah! I will weep for you with the weeping of 
JER.48.32	Your plants have gone over the sea,
JER.48.32	They reach to the sea of Jazer.
JER.48.32	The plunderer has fallen on your summer fruit and your vintage.
JER.48.33	Joy and gladness are taken
JER.48.33	From the plentiful field
JER.48.33	And from the land of Moab;
JER.48.33	I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses;
JER.48.33	No one will tread with joyous shouting—
JER.48.33	Not joyous shouting!
JER.48.34	“From
JER.48.34	They have uttered their voice,
JER.48.34	From Zoar to Horonaim,
JER.48.34	 a three-year-old heifer;
JER.48.34	For the waters of Nimrim also shall be desolate.
JER.48.35	“Moreover,” says the 
JER.48.35	“I will cause to cease in Moab
JER.48.35	The one who offers 
JER.48.35	And burns incense to his gods.
JER.48.36	Therefore 
JER.48.36	And like flutes My heart shall wail
JER.48.36	For the men of Kir Heres.
JER.48.36	Therefore 
JER.48.37	“For 
JER.48.37	On all the hands 
JER.48.38	A general lamentation
JER.48.38	On all the 
JER.48.38	And in its streets;
JER.48.38	For I have 
JER.48.39	“They shall wail:
JER.48.39	‘How she is broken down!
JER.48.39	How Moab has turned her back with shame!’
JER.48.39	So Moab shall be a derision
JER.48.39	And a dismay to all those about her.”
JER.48.40	For thus says the 
JER.48.40	“Behold, 
JER.48.40	And 
JER.48.41	Kerioth is taken,
JER.48.41	And the strongholds are surprised;
JER.48.41	The mighty men’s hearts in Moab on that day shall be
JER.48.41	Like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.
JER.48.42	And Moab shall be destroyed 
JER.48.42	Because he exalted 
JER.48.43	Fear and the pit and the snare 
JER.48.43	O inhabitant of Moab,” says the 
JER.48.44	“He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit,
JER.48.44	And he who gets out of the pit shall be caught in the 
JER.48.44	For upon Moab, upon it 
JER.48.44	The year of their punishment,” says the 
JER.48.45	“Those who fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon
JER.48.45	Because of exhaustion.
JER.48.45	But 
JER.48.45	A flame from the midst of 
JER.48.45	And 
JER.48.45	The crown of the head of the sons of tumult.
JER.48.46	Woe to you, O Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh perish;
JER.48.46	For your sons have been taken captive,
JER.48.46	And your daughters captive.
JER.48.47	“Yet I will bring back the captives of Moab
JER.48.47	In the latter days,” says the 
JER.48.47	Thus far 
JER.49.1	Against the 
JER.49.1	Thus says the 
JER.49.1	“Has Israel no sons?
JER.49.1	Has he no heir?
JER.49.1	Why 
JER.49.1	And his people dwell in its cities?
JER.49.2	Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the 
JER.49.2	“That I will cause to be heard an alarm of war
JER.49.2	In 
JER.49.2	It shall be a desolate mound,
JER.49.2	And her villages shall be burned with fire.
JER.49.2	Then Israel shall take possession of his inheritance,” says the 
JER.49.3	“Wail, O 
JER.49.3	Cry, you daughters of Rabbah,
JER.49.3	Gird yourselves with sackcloth!
JER.49.3	Lament and run to and fro by the walls;
JER.49.3	For Milcom shall go into captivity
JER.49.3	With his 
JER.49.4	Why 
JER.49.4	Your flowing valley, O 
JER.49.4	Who trusted in her 
JER.49.4	‘Who will come against me?’
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring fear upon you,”
JER.49.5	Says the Lord 
JER.49.5	“From all those who are around you;
JER.49.5	You shall be driven out, everyone headlong,
JER.49.5	And no one will gather those who wander off.
JER.49.6	But 
JER.49.6	The captives of the people of Ammon,” says the 
JER.49.7	Against Edom.
JER.49.7	Thus says the 
JER.49.7	“
JER.49.7	Has counsel perished from the prudent?
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom 
JER.49.8	Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of 
JER.49.8	For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him,
JER.49.8	The time 
JER.49.9	If grape-gatherers came to you,
JER.49.9	Would they not leave 
JER.49.9	If thieves by night,
JER.49.9	Would they not destroy until they have enough?
JER.49.10	But I have made Esau bare;
JER.49.10	I have uncovered his secret places,
JER.49.10	And he shall not be able to hide himself.
JER.49.10	His descendants are plundered,
JER.49.10	His brethren and his neighbors,
JER.49.10	And 
JER.49.11	Leave your fatherless children,
JER.49.11	I will preserve 
JER.49.11	And let your widows trust in Me.”
JER.49.12	For thus says the 
JER.49.13	For 
JER.49.14	I have heard a message from the 
JER.49.14	And an ambassador has been sent to the nations:
JER.49.14	“Gather together, come against her,
JER.49.14	And rise up to battle!
JER.49.15	“For indeed, I will make you small among nations,
JER.49.15	Despised among men.
JER.49.16	Your fierceness has deceived you,
JER.49.16	The 
JER.49.16	O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
JER.49.16	Who hold the height of the hill!
JER.49.16	Though you make your 
JER.49.16	I will bring you down from there,” says the 
JER.49.17	“Edom also shall be an astonishment;
JER.49.17	Everyone who goes by it will be astonished
JER.49.17	And will hiss at all its plagues.
JER.49.18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.49.18	And their neighbors,” says the 
JER.49.18	“No one shall remain there,
JER.49.18	Nor shall a son of man dwell in it.
JER.49.19	“Behold,
JER.49.19	Against the dwelling place of the strong;
JER.49.19	But I will suddenly make him run away from her.
JER.49.19	And who 
JER.49.19	For 
JER.49.19	Who will arraign Me?
JER.49.19	And 
JER.49.19	Who will withstand Me?”
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.49.20	And His purposes that He has proposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
JER.49.20	Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out;
JER.49.20	Surely He shall make their dwelling places desolate with them.
JER.49.21	The earth shakes at the noise of their fall;
JER.49.21	At the cry its noise is heard at the Red Sea.
JER.49.22	Behold, 
JER.49.22	And spread His wings over Bozrah;
JER.49.22	The heart of the mighty men of Edom in that day shall be
JER.49.22	Like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.
JER.49.23	Against Damascus.
JER.49.23	“Hamath and Arpad are shamed,
JER.49.23	For they have heard bad news.
JER.49.23	They are fainthearted;
JER.49.23	It cannot be quiet.
JER.49.24	Damascus has grown feeble;
JER.49.24	She turns to flee,
JER.49.24	And fear has seized 
JER.49.24	Anguish and sorrows have taken her like a woman in labor.
JER.49.25	Why is 
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets,
JER.49.26	And all the men of war shall be cut off in that day,” says the 
JER.49.27	“I
JER.49.27	And it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad.”
JER.49.28	Against Kedar and against the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall strike.
JER.49.28	Thus says the 
JER.49.28	“Arise, go up to Kedar,
JER.49.28	And devastate 
JER.49.29	Their 
JER.49.29	They shall take for themselves their curtains,
JER.49.29	All their vessels and their camels;
JER.49.29	And they shall cry out to them,
JER.49.29	‘Fear 
JER.49.30	“Flee, get far away! Dwell in the depths,
JER.49.30	O inhabitants of Hazor!” says the 
JER.49.30	“For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you,
JER.49.30	And has conceived a plan against you.

JER.49.33	“Hazor 
JER.49.33	No one shall reside there,

JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	“Thus says the 
JER.49.35	‘Behold, I will break 
JER.49.35	The foremost of their might.

JER.49.36	There shall be no nations where the outcasts of Elam will not go.
JER.49.37	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies
JER.49.37	And before those who seek their life.

JER.51.27	Prepare the nations against her,

JER.51.27	Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.
JER.51.27	Appoint a general against her;
JER.51.27	Cause the horses to come up like the bristling locusts.
JER.51.28	Prepare against her the nations,
JER.51.28	With the kings of the Medes,
JER.51.28	Its governors and all its rulers,
JER.51.28	All the land of his dominion.
JER.51.29	And the land will tremble and sorrow;
JER.51.29	For every 
JER.51.29	To make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting,
JER.51.30	They have remained in their strongholds;
JER.51.30	Their might has failed,
JER.51.30	They became 
JER.51.30	They have burned her dwelling places,

JER.51.32	The passages are blocked,
JER.51.32	The reeds they have burned with fire,
JER.51.32	And the men of war are terrified.
JER.51.33	For thus says the 
JER.51.33	“The daughter of Babylon

JER.51.34	“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon

JER.51.37	Without an inhabitant.
JER.51.38	They shall roar together like lions,
JER.51.38	They shall growl like lions’ whelps.
JER.51.39	In their excitement I will prepare their feasts;
JER.51.39	I will make them drunk,
JER.51.39	That they may rejoice,
JER.51.39	And sleep a perpetual sleep
JER.51.39	And not awake,” says the 
JER.51.40	“I will bring them down

JER.51.41	Oh, how 
JER.51.41	How Babylon has become desolate among the nations!
JER.51.42	The sea has come up over Babylon;
JER.51.42	She is covered with the multitude of its waves.
JER.51.43	Her cities are a desolation,
JER.51.43	A dry land and a wilderness,
JER.51.43	A land where 
JER.51.43	Through which no son of man passes.
JER.51.44	I will punish 
JER.51.44	And I will bring out of his mouth what he has swallowed;

JER.51.47	That I will bring judgment on the carved images of Babylon;
JER.51.47	Her whole land shall be ashamed,
JER.51.47	And all her slain shall fall in her midst.

JER.51.51	We are ashamed because we have heard reproach.
JER.51.51	Shame has covered our faces,

JER.51.52	“That I will bring judgment on her carved images,

JER.51.53	Though Babylon were to mount up to heaven,
JER.51.53	And though she were to fortify the height of her strength,
JER.51.53	 from Me plunderers would come to her,” says the

JER.51.55	Though her waves roar like great waters,
JER.51.55	And the noise of their voice is uttered,
JER.51.56	Because the plunderer comes against her, against Babylon,
JER.51.56	And her mighty men are taken.
JER.51.56	Every one of their bows is broken;
JER.51.56	For the 
JER.51.56	He will surely repay.
JER.51.57	“And I will make drunk
JER.51.57	Her princes and 
JER.51.57	Her governors, her deputies, and her mighty men.
JER.51.57	And they shall sleep a perpetual sleep

JER.51.57	Whose name 
JER.51.58	Thus says the 
JER.51.58	“The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly 
JER.51.58	And her high gates shall be burned with fire;

JER.51.58	And the nations, because of the fire;
JER.51.58	And they shall be weary.”
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of 
JER.51.60	So Jeremiah 
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you arrive in Babylon and see it, and read all these words, 
JER.51.62	then you shall say, ‘O 
JER.51.63	Now it shall be, when you have finished reading this book, 
JER.51.64	Then you shall say, ‘Thus Babylon shall sink and not rise from the catastrophe that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary.’ ”
JER.51.64	Thus far 
JER.52.1	Zedekiah 
JER.52.2	He also did evil in the sight of the 
JER.52.3	For because of the anger of the 
JER.52.4	Now it came to pass in the 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
JER.52.6	By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then the city 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him. 
JER.52.10	Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
JER.52.11	He also 
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, on the tenth 
JER.52.13	He burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Chaldeans who 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left 
JER.52.17	The 
JER.52.18	They also took away 
JER.52.19	The basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the cups, whatever 
JER.52.20	The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which 
JER.52.21	Now 
JER.52.22	A capital of bronze 
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; 
JER.52.24	The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, 
JER.52.25	He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, seven men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the principal scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. 
JER.52.26	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.
JER.52.28	These 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; 
JER.52.30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons. All the persons 
JER.52.31	Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth 
JER.52.32	And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, 
JER.52.34	And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

LAM.3.42	You have not pardoned.
LAM.3.43	You have covered 
LAM.3.43	And pursued us;
LAM.3.43	You have slain 
LAM.3.44	You have covered Yourself with a cloud,
LAM.3.44	That prayer should not pass through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us an 
LAM.3.45	In the midst of the peoples.
LAM.3.46	All our enemies
LAM.3.46	Have opened their mouths against us.
LAM.3.47	Fear and a snare have come upon us,
LAM.3.47	Desolation and destruction.
LAM.3.48	My eyes overflow with rivers of water
LAM.3.48	For the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	My eyes flow and do not cease,
LAM.3.49	Without interruption,
LAM.3.50	Till the 
LAM.3.50	Looks down and sees.
LAM.3.51	My eyes bring suffering to my soul
LAM.3.51	Because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	My enemies 
LAM.3.52	Hunted me down like a bird.
LAM.3.53	They silenced my life 
LAM.3.53	And 
LAM.3.54	The waters flowed over my head;
LAM.3.54	I said, “I am cut off!”
LAM.3.55	I called on Your name, O 
LAM.3.55	From the lowest 
LAM.3.56	You have heard my voice:
LAM.3.56	“Do not hide Your ear
LAM.3.56	From my sighing, from my cry for help.”
LAM.3.57	You 
LAM.3.57	And said, 
LAM.3.58	O Lord, You have 
LAM.3.58	You have redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	O 
LAM.3.59	Judge my case.
LAM.3.60	You have seen all their vengeance,
LAM.3.60	All their 
LAM.3.61	You have heard their reproach, O 
LAM.3.61	All their schemes against me,
LAM.3.62	The lips of my enemies
LAM.3.62	And their whispering against me all the day.
LAM.3.63	Look at their 
LAM.3.63	I 
LAM.3.64	Repay them, O 
LAM.3.64	According to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	Give them a veiled heart;
LAM.3.65	Your curse 
LAM.3.66	In Your anger,
LAM.3.66	Pursue and destroy them
LAM.3.66	From under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How the gold has become dim!
LAM.4.1	 changed the fine gold!
LAM.4.1	The stones of the sanctuary are scattered
LAM.4.1	At the head of every street.
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion,
LAM.4.2	Valuable as fine gold,
LAM.4.2	How they are regarded 
LAM.4.2	The work of the hands of the potter!
LAM.4.3	Even the jackals present their breasts
LAM.4.3	To nurse their young;
LAM.4.3	 the daughter of my people 
LAM.4.3	Like ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the infant clings
LAM.4.4	To the roof of its mouth for thirst;
LAM.4.4	The young children ask for bread,
LAM.4.4	 no one breaks 
LAM.4.5	Those who ate delicacies
LAM.4.5	Are desolate in the streets;
LAM.4.5	Those who were brought up in scarlet
LAM.4.5	Embrace ash heaps.
LAM.4.6	The punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people
LAM.4.6	Is greater than the punishment of the 
LAM.4.6	Which was 
LAM.4.6	With no hand to help her!
LAM.4.7	Her Nazirites were brighter than snow
LAM.4.7	And whiter than milk;
LAM.4.7	They were more ruddy in body than rubies,
LAM.4.7	 sapphire in their appearance.
LAM.4.8	 their appearance is blacker than soot;
LAM.4.8	They go unrecognized in the streets;
LAM.4.8	Their skin clings to their bones,
LAM.4.8	It has become as dry as wood.
LAM.4.9	 slain by the sword are better off
LAM.4.9	Than 
LAM.4.9	For these 
LAM.4.9	Stricken 
LAM.4.10	The hands of the 
LAM.4.10	Have cooked their 
LAM.4.10	They became 
LAM.4.10	In the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	He has poured out His fierce anger.
LAM.4.11	He kindled a fire in Zion,
LAM.4.11	And it has devoured its foundations.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth,
LAM.4.12	And all inhabitants of the world,
LAM.4.12	Would not have believed
LAM.4.12	That the adversary and the enemy
LAM.4.12	Could 
LAM.4.13	Because of the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	 the iniquities of her priests,
LAM.4.13	Who shed in her midst
LAM.4.13	The blood of the just.
LAM.4.14	They wandered blind in the streets;
LAM.4.14	They have defiled themselves with blood,
LAM.4.14	So that no one would touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	They cried out to them,
LAM.4.15	“Go away, 
LAM.4.15	Go away, go away,
LAM.4.15	Do not touch us!”
LAM.4.15	When they fled and wandered,
LAM.4.15	 among the nations said,
LAM.4.15	“They shall no longer dwell 
LAM.4.16	The face of the 
LAM.4.16	He no longer regards them.
LAM.4.16	Nor show favor to the elders.
LAM.4.17	Still 
LAM.4.17	 vainly for our help;
LAM.4.17	In our watching we watched
LAM.4.17	For a nation 
LAM.4.18	They tracked our steps
LAM.4.18	So that we could not walk in our streets.
LAM.4.18	Our end was near;
LAM.4.18	Our days were over,
LAM.4.18	For our end had come.
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were 
LAM.4.19	Than the eagles of the heavens.
LAM.4.19	They pursued us on the mountains
LAM.4.19	And lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The 
LAM.4.20	Was caught in their pits,
LAM.4.20	Of whom we said, “Under his shadow
LAM.4.20	We shall live among the nations.”
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of 
LAM.4.21	 who dwell in the land of Uz!
LAM.4.21	The cup shall also pass over to you
LAM.4.21	And you shall become drunk and make yourself naked.
LAM.4.22	O daughter of Zion;
LAM.4.22	He will no longer send you into captivity.
LAM.4.22	He will punish your iniquity,
LAM.4.22	O daughter of Edom;
LAM.4.22	He will uncover your sins!
LAM.5.1	Remember, 
LAM.5.1	Look, and behold 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens,
LAM.5.2	And our houses to foreigners.
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans and waifs,
LAM.5.3	Our mothers 
LAM.5.4	We pay for the water we drink,
LAM.5.4	And our wood comes at a price.
LAM.5.5	 pursue at our heels;
LAM.5.5	We labor 
LAM.5.6	We have given our hand 
LAM.5.6	 the 
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned 
LAM.5.7	But we bear their iniquities.
LAM.5.8	Servants rule over us;
LAM.5.9	We get our bread 
LAM.5.9	Because of the sword in the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is hot as an oven,
LAM.5.10	Because of the fever of famine.
LAM.5.11	They 
LAM.5.11	The maidens in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes were hung up by their hands,
LAM.5.12	And elders were not respected.
LAM.5.13	Young men 
LAM.5.13	Boys staggered under 
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased 
LAM.5.14	And the young men from their 
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart has ceased;
LAM.5.15	Our dance has turned into 
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen 
LAM.5.16	Woe to us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	Because of this our heart is faint;
LAM.5.17	Because of these 
LAM.5.18	Because of Mount Zion which is 
LAM.5.18	With foxes walking about on it.
LAM.5.19	You, O 
LAM.5.19	Your throne from generation to generation.
LAM.5.20	Why do You forget us forever,
LAM.5.20	 forsake us for so long a time?
LAM.5.21	Turn us back to You, O 
LAM.5.21	Renew our days as of old,
LAM.5.22	Unless You have utterly rejected us,
LAM.5.22	 are very angry with us!
EZK.1.1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth 
EZK.1.2	On the fifth 
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	Then I looked, and behold, 
EZK.1.5	Also from within it 
EZK.1.6	Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs 
EZK.1.8	The hands of a man 
EZK.1.9	Their wings touched one another. 
EZK.1.10	As for 
EZK.1.11	Thus 
EZK.1.12	And 
EZK.1.13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance 
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures ran back and forth, 
EZK.1.15	Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, 
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their workings 
EZK.1.17	When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went. 
EZK.1.18	As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims 
EZK.1.19	When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, 
EZK.1.21	When those went, 
EZK.1.22	The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures 
EZK.1.23	And under the firmament their wings 
EZK.1.24	When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, 
EZK.1.25	A voice came from above the firmament that 
EZK.1.26	And above the firmament over their heads 
EZK.1.27	Also from the appearance of His waist and upward 
EZK.1.28	Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so 
EZK.1.28	So when I saw 
EZK.2.1	And He said to me, “Son of man, 
EZK.2.2	Then 
EZK.2.3	And He said to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has 
EZK.2.4	For 
EZK.2.5	As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse—for they 
EZK.2.6	“And you, son of man, 
EZK.2.7	You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they 
EZK.2.8	But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and 
EZK.2.9	Now when I looked, there was 
EZK.2.10	Then He spread it before me; and 
EZK.3.1	Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll.
EZK.3.3	And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you.” So I 
EZK.3.4	Then He said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you 
EZK.3.6	not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, 
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not listen to you, 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; 
EZK.3.10	Moreover He said to me: “Son of man, receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears. 
EZK.3.11	And go, get to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, 
EZK.3.12	Then 
EZK.3.13	 also 
EZK.3.14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and 
EZK.3.16	Now it 
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have made you 
EZK.3.18	When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked 
EZK.3.19	Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; 
EZK.3.20	“Again, when a 
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if you warn the righteous 
EZK.3.22	Then the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, 
EZK.3.24	Then 
EZK.3.25	And you, O son of man, surely 
EZK.3.26	I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 
EZK.4.1	“You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Lay siege against it, build a 
EZK.4.3	Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it 
EZK.4.4	“Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. 
EZK.4.5	For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; 
EZK.4.6	And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.
EZK.4.7	“Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm 
EZK.4.8	And surely I will restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. 
EZK.4.10	And your food which you eat 
EZK.4.11	You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink. 
EZK.4.12	And you shall eat it 
EZK.4.13	Then the 
EZK.4.14	So I said, 
EZK.4.15	Then He said to me, “See, I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste, and you shall prepare your bread over it.”
EZK.4.16	Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, surely I will cut off the 
EZK.4.17	that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed with one another, and 
EZK.5.1	“And you, son of man, take a sharp sword, take it as a barber’s razor, 
EZK.5.2	You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of 
EZK.5.3	You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your

EZK.5.5	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.5.6	She has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that 
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.5.8	therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.5.9	And I will do among you what I have never done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations. 
EZK.5.10	Therefore fathers 
EZK.5.11	‘Therefore, 
EZK.5.12	One-third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and one-third shall fall by the sword all around you; and 
EZK.5.13	‘Thus shall My anger

EZK.6.3	and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.6.4	Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and 
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars. 
EZK.6.6	In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
EZK.6.7	The slain shall fall in your midst, and

EZK.8.3	He 
EZK.8.4	And behold, the 
EZK.8.5	Then He said to me, “Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was this image of jealousy in the entrance.
EZK.8.6	Furthermore He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great 
EZK.8.7	So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	Then He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall”; and when I dug into the wall, there was a door.
EZK.8.9	And He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there.” 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw, and there—every

EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the 
EZK.10.6	Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheels. 
EZK.10.7	And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that 
EZK.10.8	The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
EZK.10.9	And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went toward 
EZK.10.12	And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, 
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “Wheel.”
EZK.10.14	Each one had four faces: the first face 
EZK.10.15	And the cherubim were lifted up. This 
EZK.10.16	When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When 
EZK.10.18	Then 
EZK.10.19	And 
EZK.10.20	This 
EZK.10.21	Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man 
EZK.10.22	And 
EZK.11.1	Then 
EZK.11.2	And He said to me: “Son of man, these 
EZK.11.3	who say, ‘
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!”
EZK.11.5	Then 
EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.” 
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.11.8	You have 
EZK.11.9	“And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and 
EZK.11.10	You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at 
EZK.11.11	This 
EZK.11.12	And you shall know that I 
EZK.11.13	Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that

EZK.11.15	“Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety,

EZK.11.22	So the cherubim 
EZK.11.23	And 
EZK.11.24	Then 
EZK.11.25	So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the

EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you dwell in the midst of

EZK.12.4	By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity. 
EZK.12.5	Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry 
EZK.12.6	In their sight you shall bear 
EZK.12.7	So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought

EZK.40.20	On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width. 
EZK.40.21	Its gate chambers, three on this side and three on that side, its gateposts and its archways, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length 
EZK.40.22	Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, 
EZK.40.23	A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the eastern

DAN.1.3	Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring 
DAN.1.4	young men 
DAN.1.5	And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of 
DAN.1.6	Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: 
DAN.1.8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself 
DAN.1.9	Now 
DAN.1.10	And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who 
DAN.1.11	So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king’s delicacies; and as you see fit, 
DAN.1.14	So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days.
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king’s delicacies. 
DAN.1.16	Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	As for these four young men, 
DAN.1.18	Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore 
DAN.1.20	And in all matters of wisdom 
DAN.1.21	Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; 
DAN.2.2	Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 
DAN.2.3	And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, 
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be 
DAN.2.6	However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”
DAN.2.7	They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: 
DAN.2.9	if you do not make known the dream to me, 
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has 
DAN.2.12	For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise 
DAN.2.14	Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise 
DAN.2.15	he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation. 
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, 
DAN.2.18	that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise 
DAN.2.19	Then the secret was revealed to Daniel 
DAN.2.20	Daniel answered and said:
DAN.2.20	“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,
DAN.2.20	For wisdom and might are His.
DAN.2.21	And He changes 
DAN.2.21	He removes kings and raises up kings;
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise
DAN.2.21	And knowledge to those who have understanding.
DAN.2.22	He reveals deep and secret things;
DAN.2.22	He knows what 
DAN.2.22	And 
DAN.2.23	“I thank You and praise You,
DAN.2.23	O God of my fathers;
DAN.2.23	You have given me wisdom and might,
DAN.2.23	And have now made known to me what we 
DAN.2.23	For You have made known to us the king’s demand.”
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise 
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.”
DAN.2.26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded, the wise 
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar 
DAN.2.29	As for you, O king, thoughts came 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for 
DAN.2.31	“You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor 
DAN.2.32	This image’s head 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 
DAN.2.34	You watched while a stone was cut out 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became 
DAN.2.36	“This 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, 
DAN.2.38	and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given 
DAN.2.39	But after you shall arise 
DAN.2.40	And 
DAN.2.41	Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. 
DAN.2.42	And 
DAN.2.43	As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. 
DAN.2.44	And in the days of these kings 
DAN.2.45	Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering 
DAN.2.47	The king answered Daniel, and said, “Truly 
DAN.2.48	Then the king promoted Daniel 
DAN.2.49	Also Daniel petitioned the king, 
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height 
DAN.3.2	And King Nebuchadnezzar sent 
DAN.3.3	So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	Then a herald cried aloud: “To you it is commanded, 
DAN.3.5	 at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, 
DAN.3.6	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall 
DAN.3.7	So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, 
DAN.3.8	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans 
DAN.3.9	They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, 
DAN.3.10	You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, 
DAN.3.11	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have 
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar, in 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, “
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, 
DAN.3.17	If that 
DAN.3.18	But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we 
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. 
DAN.3.20	And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans, and their 
DAN.3.22	Therefore, because the king’s command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. 
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste 
DAN.3.24	They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”
DAN.3.25	“Look!” he answered, “I see four men loose, 
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace 
DAN.3.27	And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together, and they saw these men 
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language which speaks anything amiss against the

DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king,
DAN.4.1	To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth:
DAN.4.1	Peace be multiplied to you.
DAN.4.2	I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders 
DAN.4.3	How great 
DAN.4.3	And how mighty His wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom 
DAN.4.3	And His dominion 
DAN.4.4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid, 
DAN.4.6	Therefore I issued a decree to bring in all the wise 
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told them the dream; but they did not make known to me its interpretation. 
DAN.4.8	But at last Daniel came before me 
DAN.4.9	“Belteshazzar, 
DAN.4.10	“These 
DAN.4.10	I was looking, and behold,
DAN.4.10	A tree in the midst of the earth,
DAN.4.10	And its height was great.
DAN.4.11	The tree grew and became strong;
DAN.4.11	Its height reached to the heavens,
DAN.4.11	And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth.
DAN.4.12	Its leaves 
DAN.4.12	Its fruit abundant,
DAN.4.12	And in it 
DAN.4.12	The beasts of the field found shade under it,
DAN.4.12	The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches,
DAN.4.12	And all flesh was fed from it.
DAN.4.13	“I saw in the visions of my head 
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud and said thus:
DAN.4.14	‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches,
DAN.4.14	Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.
DAN.4.14	Let the beasts get out from under it,
DAN.4.14	And the birds from its branches.

DAN.4.31	While the word 
DAN.4.32	And 
DAN.4.33	That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar; he was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair had grown like eagles’

DAN.5.4	They drank wine, 
DAN.5.5	In the same hour the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his hips were loosened and his

DAN.5.8	Now all the king’s wise 
DAN.5.9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly 
DAN.5.10	The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came to the banquet hall. The queen spoke, saying, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance change. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom in whom 
DAN.5.12	Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel, 
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke, and said to Daniel, “
DAN.5.14	I have heard of you, that 
DAN.5.15	Now 
DAN.5.16	And I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and explain enigmas. 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered, and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 
DAN.5.18	O king, 
DAN.5.19	And because of the majesty that He gave him, 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.

DAN.5.31	And Darius the Mede received the kingdom,

DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open 
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 
DAN.6.12	And they went before the king, and spoke concerning the king’s decree: “Have you not signed a decree that every man who petitions any god or man within thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”
DAN.6.12	The king answered and said, “The thing 
DAN.6.13	So they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, 
DAN.6.14	And the king, when he heard 
DAN.6.15	Then these men approached the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that 
DAN.6.16	So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast 
DAN.6.17	Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, 
DAN.6.18	Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians were brought before him. 
DAN.6.19	Then the 
DAN.6.20	And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, 
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel said to the king, 
DAN.6.22	My God sent His angel and 
DAN.6.23	Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, 
DAN.6.24	And the king gave the command, 
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius wrote:
DAN.6.25	To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth:
DAN.6.25	Peace be multiplied to you.
DAN.6.26	I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom 
DAN.6.26	For He 
DAN.6.26	And steadfast forever;
DAN.6.26	His kingdom 
DAN.6.26	And His dominion 
DAN.6.27	He delivers and rescues,
DAN.6.27	And He works signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	In heaven and on earth,
DAN.6.27	Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius 
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, 
DAN.7.2	Daniel spoke, saying, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea. 
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts 
DAN.7.4	The first 
DAN.7.5	“And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and 
DAN.7.6	“After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had 
DAN.7.7	“After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, 
DAN.7.8	I was considering the horns, and 
DAN.7.9	“I
DAN.7.9	And 
DAN.7.9	His garment 
DAN.7.9	And the hair of His head 
DAN.7.9	His throne 
DAN.7.9	Its wheels a burning fire;
DAN.7.10	A fiery stream issued
DAN.7.10	And came forth from before Him.
DAN.7.10	A thousand thousands ministered to Him;
DAN.7.10	Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.
DAN.7.10	The court was seated,
DAN.7.10	And the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	“I watched then because of the sound of the pompous words which the horn was speaking; 
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
DAN.7.13	“I was watching in the night visions,
DAN.7.13	And behold, 
DAN.7.13	Coming with the clouds of heaven!
DAN.7.13	He came to the Ancient of Days,
DAN.7.13	And they brought Him near before Him.
DAN.7.14	Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,
DAN.7.14	That all 
DAN.7.14	His dominion 
DAN.7.14	Which shall not pass away,
DAN.7.14	And His kingdom 
DAN.7.14	Which shall not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within 
DAN.7.16	I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: 
DAN.7.17	‘Those great beasts, which are four, 
DAN.7.18	But 
DAN.7.19	“Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, 
DAN.7.20	and the ten horns that 
DAN.7.21	“I was watching; 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came, 
DAN.7.23	“Thus he said:
DAN.7.23	‘The fourth beast shall be
DAN.7.23	A fourth kingdom on earth,
DAN.7.23	Which shall be different from all 
DAN.7.23	And shall devour the whole earth,
DAN.7.23	Trample it and break it in pieces.
DAN.7.24	The ten horns 
DAN.7.24	 shall arise from this kingdom.
DAN.7.24	And another shall rise after them;
DAN.7.24	He shall be different from the first 
DAN.7.24	And shall subdue three kings.
DAN.7.25	He shall speak 
DAN.7.25	Shall 
DAN.7.25	And shall 
DAN.7.25	Then 
DAN.7.25	For a time and times and half a time.
DAN.7.26	‘But
DAN.7.26	And they shall 
DAN.7.26	To consume and destroy 
DAN.7.27	Then the 
DAN.7.27	And the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven,
DAN.7.27	Shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.
DAN.7.27	His kingdom 
DAN.7.27	And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.’
DAN.7.28	“This 
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared 
DAN.8.2	I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I 
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was a ram which had two horns, and the two horns 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could withstand him; nor 
DAN.8.5	And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat 
DAN.8.6	Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power. 
DAN.8.7	And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.
DAN.8.8	Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it 
DAN.8.9	And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, 
DAN.8.10	And it grew up to 
DAN.8.11	He even exalted 
DAN.8.12	Because of transgression, 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard 
DAN.8.14	And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.”
DAN.8.15	Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man’s voice 
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and 
DAN.8.18	Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; 
DAN.8.19	And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; 
DAN.8.20	The ram which you saw, having the two horns—
DAN.8.21	And the male goat 
DAN.8.22	As for the broken 
DAN.8.23	“And in the latter time of their kingdom,
DAN.8.23	When the transgressors have reached their fullness,
DAN.8.23	A king shall arise,
DAN.8.23	Having fierce features,
DAN.8.23	Who understands sinister schemes.
DAN.8.24	His power shall be mighty, 
DAN.8.24	He shall destroy fearfully,
DAN.8.24	And shall prosper and thrive;
DAN.8.24	He shall destroy the mighty, and 
DAN.8.25	“Through
DAN.8.25	He shall cause deceit to prosper under his rule;
DAN.8.25	And he shall exalt 
DAN.8.25	He shall destroy many in 
DAN.8.25	He shall even rise against the Prince of princes;
DAN.8.25	But he shall be 
DAN.8.26	“And the vision of the evenings and mornings
DAN.8.26	Which was told is true;
DAN.8.26	Therefore seal up the vision,
DAN.8.26	For 
DAN.8.27	And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days; afterward I arose and went about the king’s business. I was astonished by the vision, but no one understood it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years 
DAN.9.3	Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. 
DAN.9.4	And I prayed to the 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments. 
DAN.9.6	Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes, to our fathers and all the people of the land. 
DAN.9.7	O Lord, 
DAN.9.8	“O Lord, to us 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God 
DAN.9.10	We have not obeyed the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	Yes, 
DAN.9.12	And He has 
DAN.9.13	“As 
DAN.9.14	Therefore the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord our God, 
DAN.9.16	“O Lord, 
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, 
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes 
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my God, for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”
DAN.9.20	Now while I 
DAN.9.21	yes, while I 
DAN.9.22	And he informed 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell 
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks are determined
DAN.9.24	For your people and for your holy city,
DAN.9.24	To finish the transgression,
DAN.9.24	To make an end of sins,
DAN.9.24	To make reconciliation for iniquity,
DAN.9.24	To bring in everlasting righteousness,
DAN.9.24	To seal up vision and prophecy,
DAN.9.24	And to anoint the Most Holy.
DAN.9.25	“Know therefore and understand,
DAN.9.25	 from the going forth of the command
DAN.9.25	To restore and build Jerusalem
DAN.9.25	Until 
DAN.9.25	The street shall be built again, and the wall,
DAN.9.25	Even in troublesome times.
DAN.9.26	“And after the sixty-two weeks
DAN.9.26	Messiah shall be cut off, 
DAN.9.26	And 
DAN.9.26	Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.
DAN.9.26	The end of it 
DAN.9.26	And till the end of the war desolations are determined.
DAN.9.27	Then he shall confirm 
DAN.9.27	But in the middle of the week
DAN.9.27	He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering.
DAN.9.27	And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate,
DAN.9.27	Even until the consummation, which is determined,
DAN.9.27	Is poured out on the desolate.”
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose 
DAN.10.2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
DAN.10.4	Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, that 
DAN.10.5	I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in 
DAN.10.6	His body 
DAN.10.7	And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me; for my vigor was turned to frailty in me, and I retained no strength. 
DAN.10.9	Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.
DAN.10.10	Suddenly, a hand touched me, which made me tremble on my knees and 
DAN.10.11	And he said to me, “O Daniel, 
DAN.10.12	Then he said to me, 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people 
DAN.10.15	When he had spoken such words to me, 
DAN.10.16	And suddenly, 
DAN.10.17	For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me, no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.”
DAN.10.18	Then again, 
DAN.10.19	And he said, “O man greatly beloved, 
DAN.10.19	So when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”
DAN.10.20	Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I must return to fight 
DAN.10.21	But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds me against these, 
DAN.11.1	“Also 
DAN.11.2	And now I will tell you the truth: Behold, three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than 
DAN.11.3	Then 
DAN.11.4	And when he has arisen, 
DAN.11.5	“Also the king of the South shall become strong, as well as 
DAN.11.6	And at the end of 
DAN.11.7	But from a branch of her roots 
DAN.11.8	And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt, with their princes 
DAN.11.9	“Also 
DAN.11.10	However his sons shall stir up strife, and assemble a multitude of great forces; and 
DAN.11.11	“And the king of the South shall be 
DAN.11.12	When he has taken away the multitude, his heart will be lifted up; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail. 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the North will return and muster a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come at the end of some years with a great army and much equipment.
DAN.11.14	“Now in those times many shall rise up against the king of the South. Also, violent men of your people shall exalt themselves in fulfillment of the vision, but they shall 
DAN.11.15	So the king of the North shall come and 
DAN.11.16	But he who comes against him 
DAN.11.17	“He shall also 
DAN.11.18	After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many. But a ruler shall bring the reproach against them to an end; and with the reproach removed, he shall turn back on him. 
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land; but he shall 
DAN.11.20	“There shall arise in his place one who imposes taxes 
DAN.11.21	And in his place 
DAN.11.22	With the force of a 
DAN.11.23	And after the league 
DAN.11.24	He shall enter peaceably, even into the richest places of the province; and he shall do 
DAN.11.25	“He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army. And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him. 
DAN.11.26	Yes, those who eat of the portion of his delicacies shall destroy him; his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain. 
DAN.11.27	Both these kings’ hearts 
DAN.11.28	While returning to his land with great riches, his heart shall be 
DAN.11.29	“At the appointed time he shall return and go toward the south; but it shall not be like the former or the latter. 
DAN.11.30	For ships from Cyprus shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and return in rage against the holy covenant, and do 
DAN.11.30	“So he shall return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. 
DAN.11.31	And forces shall be mustered by him, 
DAN.11.32	Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery; but the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out 
DAN.11.33	And those of the people who understand shall instruct many; yet 
DAN.11.34	Now when they fall, they shall be aided with a little help; but many shall join with them by intrigue. 
DAN.11.35	And 
DAN.11.36	“Then the king shall do according to his own will: he shall 
DAN.11.37	He shall regard neither the God of his fathers nor the desire of women, 
DAN.11.38	But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses; and a god which his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and pleasant things. 
DAN.11.39	Thus he shall act against the strongest fortresses with a foreign god, which he shall acknowledge, 
DAN.11.40	“At the 
DAN.11.41	He shall also enter the Glorious Land, and many 
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of 
DAN.11.43	He shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; also the Libyans and Ethiopians 
DAN.11.44	But news from the east and the north shall trouble him; therefore he shall go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many. 
DAN.11.45	And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and 
DAN.12.1	“At that time Michael shall stand up,
DAN.12.1	The great prince who stands 
DAN.12.1	And there shall be a time of trouble,
DAN.12.1	Such as never was since there was a nation,
DAN.12.1	 to that time.
DAN.12.1	And at that time your people 
DAN.12.1	Every one who is found 
DAN.12.2	And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
DAN.12.2	Some to everlasting life,
DAN.12.2	Some to shame 
DAN.12.3	Those who are wise shall 
DAN.12.3	Like the brightness of the firmament,
DAN.12.3	And those who turn many to righteousness
DAN.12.3	Like the stars forever and ever.
DAN.12.4	“But you, Daniel, 
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked; and there stood two others, one on this riverbank and the other on that 
DAN.12.6	And 
DAN.12.7	Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who 
DAN.12.8	Although I heard, I did not understand. Then I said, “My lord, what 
DAN.12.9	And he said, “Go 
DAN.12.10	Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, 
DAN.12.11	“And from the time

DAN.12.13	“But you, go

HOS.1.4	Then the 
HOS.1.4	“Call his name Jezreel,
HOS.1.4	For in a little 
HOS.1.4	I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu,
HOS.1.4	And bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
HOS.1.5	It shall come to pass in that day
HOS.1.5	That I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again and bore a daughter. Then 
HOS.1.6	“Call her name Lo-Ruhamah,
HOS.1.6	For I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel,
HOS.1.6	But I will utterly take them away.
HOS.1.7	Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah,

HOS.1.8	Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. 
HOS.1.9	Then 
HOS.1.9	“Call his name Lo-Ammi,

HOS.1.9	And I will not be your

HOS.1.10	Shall be as the sand of the sea,
HOS.1.10	Which cannot be measured or numbered.
HOS.1.10	And it shall come to pass
HOS.1.10	In the place where it was said to them,
HOS.1.10	‘You 
HOS.1.10	 it shall be said to them,

HOS.1.11	Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel
HOS.1.11	Shall be gathered together,

JOL.1.4	And what the crawling locust left, the consuming locust has eaten.
JOL.1.5	Awake, you 
JOL.1.5	And wail, all you drinkers of wine,
JOL.1.5	Because of the new wine,

JOL.1.7	He has stripped it bare and thrown 
JOL.1.7	Its branches are made white.
JOL.1.8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth
JOL.1.8	For 
JOL.1.9	The grain offering and the drink offering

JOL.1.10	The land mourns;
JOL.1.10	For the grain is ruined,
JOL.1.10	The new wine is dried up,
JOL.1.10	The oil fails.
JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, you farmers,
JOL.1.11	Wail, you vinedressers,
JOL.1.11	For the wheat and the barley;
JOL.1.11	Because the harvest of the field has perished.
JOL.1.12	The vine has dried up,
JOL.1.12	And the fig tree has withered;
JOL.1.12	The pomegranate tree,
JOL.1.12	The palm tree also,
JOL.1.12	And the apple tree—
JOL.1.12	All the trees of the field are withered;
JOL.1.12	Surely 
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves and lament, you priests;

JOL.1.13	Come, lie all night in sackcloth,
JOL.1.13	You who minister to my God;
JOL.1.13	For the grain offering and the drink offering
JOL.1.13	Are withheld from the house of your God.

JOL.1.16	Is not the food 
JOL.1.16	Joy and gladness from the house of our God?
JOL.1.17	The seed shrivels under the clods,
JOL.1.17	Storehouses are in shambles;
JOL.1.17	Barns are broken down,
JOL.1.17	For the grain has withered.
JOL.1.18	How 
JOL.1.18	The herds of cattle are restless,
JOL.1.18	Because they have no pasture;
JOL.1.18	Even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.
JOL.1.19	O

JOL.2.2	A people 
JOL.2.2	The like of whom has never been;
JOL.2.2	Nor will there ever be any 
JOL.2.2	Even for many successive generations.
JOL.2.3	A fire devours before them,
JOL.2.3	And behind them a flame burns;
JOL.2.3	The land 
JOL.2.3	And behind them a desolate wilderness;
JOL.2.3	Surely nothing shall escape them.
JOL.2.4	Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;
JOL.2.4	And like swift steeds, so they run.
JOL.2.5	With a noise like chariots
JOL.2.5	Over mountaintops they leap,
JOL.2.5	Like the noise of a flaming fire that devours the stubble,
JOL.2.5	Like a strong people set in battle array.
JOL.2.6	Before them the people writhe in pain;
JOL.2.6	All faces are drained of color.
JOL.2.7	They run like mighty men,
JOL.2.7	They climb the wall like men of war;
JOL.2.7	Every one marches in formation,
JOL.2.7	And they do not break 
JOL.2.8	They do not push one another;
JOL.2.8	Every one marches in his own column.
JOL.2.8	Though they lunge between the weapons,
JOL.2.8	They are not cut down.
JOL.2.9	They run to and fro in the city,
JOL.2.9	They run on the wall;
JOL.2.9	They climb into the houses,

JOL.2.10	The earth quakes before them,

AMO.4.11	Yet you have not returned to Me,”
AMO.4.11	Says the 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore thus will I do to you, O Israel;
AMO.4.12	Because I will do this to you,
AMO.4.12	Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!”
AMO.4.13	For behold,
AMO.4.13	He who forms mountains,
AMO.4.13	And creates the wind,
AMO.4.13	Who declares to man what his thought 
AMO.4.13	And makes the morning darkness,
AMO.4.13	Who treads the high places of the earth—
AMO.4.13	The 
AMO.5.1	Hear this word which I 
AMO.5.2	The virgin of Israel has fallen;
AMO.5.2	She will rise no more.
AMO.5.2	She lies forsaken on her land;
AMO.5.3	For thus says the Lord 
AMO.5.3	“The city that goes out by a thousand
AMO.5.3	Shall have a hundred left,
AMO.5.3	And that which goes out by a hundred
AMO.5.3	Shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”
AMO.5.4	For thus says the 
AMO.5.4	“Seek Me 
AMO.5.5	But do not seek 
AMO.5.5	Nor enter Gilgal,
AMO.5.5	Nor pass over to 
AMO.5.5	For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,
AMO.5.5	And 
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.6	Lest He break out like fire 
AMO.5.6	And devour 
AMO.5.6	With no one to quench 
AMO.5.7	You who 
AMO.5.7	And lay righteousness to rest in the earth!”
AMO.5.8	He made the 
AMO.5.8	He turns the shadow of death into morning
AMO.5.8	And makes the day dark as night;
AMO.5.8	He 
AMO.5.8	And pours them out on the face of the earth;
AMO.5.8	The 
AMO.5.9	He rains ruin upon the strong,
AMO.5.9	So that fury comes upon the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate the one who rebukes in the gate,
AMO.5.10	And they 
AMO.5.11	Therefore, because you tread down the poor
AMO.5.11	And take grain taxes from him,
AMO.5.11	Though 
AMO.5.11	Yet you shall not dwell in them;
AMO.5.11	You have planted pleasant vineyards,
AMO.5.11	But you shall not drink wine from them.
AMO.5.12	For I 
AMO.5.12	And your mighty sins:
AMO.5.12	Afflicting the just 
AMO.5.12	Diverting the poor 
AMO.5.13	Therefore 
AMO.5.13	For it 
AMO.5.14	Seek good and not evil,
AMO.5.14	That you may live;
AMO.5.14	So the 
AMO.5.14	As you have spoken.
AMO.5.15	Hate evil, love good;
AMO.5.15	Establish justice in the gate.
AMO.5.15	It may be that the 
AMO.5.15	Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.16	“
AMO.5.16	And they shall say in all the highways,
AMO.5.16	‘Alas! Alas!’
AMO.5.16	They shall call the farmer to mourning,
AMO.5.16	And skillful lamenters to wailing.
AMO.5.17	In all vineyards 
AMO.5.17	For 
AMO.5.17	Says the 
AMO.5.18	Woe to you who desire the day of the 
AMO.5.18	For what good 
AMO.5.18	It 
AMO.5.19	It 
AMO.5.19	And a bear met him!
AMO.5.19	Or 
AMO.5.19	Leaned his hand on the wall,
AMO.5.19	And a serpent bit him!
AMO.5.20	 not the day of the 
AMO.5.21	“I
AMO.5.21	And 
AMO.5.22	Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept 
AMO.5.22	Nor will I regard your fattened peace offerings.
AMO.5.23	Take away from Me the noise of your songs,
AMO.5.23	For I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments.
AMO.5.24	But let justice run down like water,
AMO.5.24	And righteousness like a mighty stream.
AMO.5.25	“Did
AMO.5.25	In the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
AMO.5.26	You also carried Sikkuth 
AMO.5.26	And Chiun, your idols,
AMO.5.26	The star of your gods,
AMO.5.26	Which you made for yourselves.
AMO.5.27	Therefore I will send you into captivity 
AMO.5.27	Says the 
AMO.6.1	Woe 
AMO.6.1	And 
AMO.6.1	Notable persons in the 
AMO.6.1	To whom the house of Israel comes!
AMO.6.2	Go over to 
AMO.6.2	And from there go to 
AMO.6.2	Then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
AMO.6.2	Or is their territory greater than your territory?
AMO.6.3	Who cause 
AMO.6.4	Who lie on beds of ivory,
AMO.6.4	Stretch out on your couches,
AMO.6.4	Eat lambs from the flock
AMO.6.4	And calves from the midst of the stall;
AMO.6.5	Who sing idly to the sound of stringed instruments,
AMO.6.5	 invent for yourselves 
AMO.6.6	Who 
AMO.6.6	And anoint yourselves with the best ointments,
AMO.6.6	But are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore they shall now go 
AMO.6.7	And those who recline at banquets shall be removed.
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.8	The 
AMO.6.8	“I abhor 
AMO.6.8	And hate his palaces;
AMO.6.8	Therefore I will deliver up 
AMO.6.8	And all that is in it.”
AMO.6.9	Then it shall come to pass, that if ten men remain in one house, they shall die. 
AMO.6.10	And when a relative 
AMO.6.10	Then someone will say, “None.”
AMO.6.10	And he will say, 
AMO.6.11	For behold, 
AMO.6.11	He will break the great house into bits,
AMO.6.11	And the little house into pieces.
AMO.6.12	Do horses run on rocks?
AMO.6.12	Does 
AMO.6.12	Yet 
AMO.6.12	And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,
AMO.6.13	You who rejoice over Lo Debar,
AMO.6.13	Who say, “Have we not taken Karnaim for ourselves
AMO.6.13	By our own strength?”
AMO.6.14	“But, behold, 
AMO.6.14	O house of Israel,”
AMO.6.14	Says the 
AMO.6.14	“And they will afflict you from the 
AMO.6.14	To the Valley of the Arabah.”
AMO.7.1	Thus the Lord 
AMO.7.2	And so it was, when they had finished eating the grass of the land, that I said:
AMO.7.2	“O Lord 
AMO.7.2	Oh, that Jacob may stand,
AMO.7.2	For he 
AMO.7.3	“It shall not be,” said the 
AMO.7.4	Thus the Lord 
AMO.7.5	Then I said:
AMO.7.5	“O Lord 
AMO.7.5	Oh, that Jacob may stand,
AMO.7.5	For he 
AMO.7.6	 the 
AMO.7.6	“This also shall not be,” said the Lord 
AMO.7.7	Thus He showed me: Behold, the Lord stood on a wall 
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.8	And I said, “A plumb line.”
AMO.7.8	Then the Lord said:
AMO.7.8	“Behold, 
AMO.7.8	In the midst of My people Israel;
AMO.7.8	I will not pass by them anymore.
AMO.7.9	The high places of Isaac shall be desolate,
AMO.7.9	And the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste.
AMO.7.9	I will rise with the sword against the house of Jeroboam.”
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the 
AMO.7.11	For thus Amos has said:
AMO.7.11	‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
AMO.7.11	And Israel shall surely be led away 
AMO.7.11	From their own land.’ ”
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos:
AMO.7.12	“Go, you seer!
AMO.7.12	Flee to the land of Judah.
AMO.7.12	There eat bread,
AMO.7.12	And there prophesy.
AMO.7.13	But 
AMO.7.13	For it 
AMO.7.13	And it 
AMO.7.14	Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah:
AMO.7.14	“I 
AMO.7.14	Nor 
AMO.7.14	But I 
AMO.7.14	And a tender of sycamore fruit.
AMO.7.15	Then the 
AMO.7.15	And the 
AMO.7.15	‘Go, 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore, hear the word of the 
AMO.7.16	You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,
AMO.7.16	And 
AMO.7.17	“Therefore
AMO.7.17	‘Your wife shall be a harlot in the city;
AMO.7.17	Your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword;
AMO.7.17	Your land shall be divided by 
AMO.7.17	You shall die in a 
AMO.7.17	And Israel shall surely be led away captive
AMO.7.17	From his own land.’ ”
AMO.8.1	Thus the Lord 
AMO.8.2	And He said, “Amos, what do you see?”
AMO.8.2	So I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
AMO.8.2	Then the 
AMO.8.2	“The end has come upon My people Israel;
AMO.8.2	I will not pass by them anymore.
AMO.8.3	And 
AMO.8.3	Shall be wailing in that day,”
AMO.8.3	Says the Lord 
AMO.8.3	“Many dead bodies everywhere,
AMO.8.3	They shall be thrown out in silence.”
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who swallow up the needy,
AMO.8.4	And make the poor of the land fail,
AMO.8.5	Saying:
AMO.8.5	“When will the New Moon be past,
AMO.8.5	That we may sell grain?
AMO.8.5	And 
AMO.8.5	That we may trade wheat?
AMO.8.5	Making the ephah small and the shekel large,
AMO.8.5	Falsifying the scales by 
AMO.8.6	That we may buy the poor for 
AMO.8.6	And the needy for a pair of sandals—
AMO.8.6	Even sell the bad wheat?”
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.7	“Surely 
AMO.8.8	Shall the land not tremble for this,
AMO.8.8	And everyone mourn who dwells in it?
AMO.8.8	All of it shall swell like the River,
AMO.8.8	Heave and subside
AMO.8.8	Like the River of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	“And it shall come to pass in that day,” says the Lord 
AMO.8.9	“That I will make the sun go down at noon,
AMO.8.9	And I will darken the earth in broad daylight;
AMO.8.10	I will turn your feasts into 
AMO.8.10	And all your songs into lamentation;
AMO.8.10	I will bring sackcloth on every waist,
AMO.8.10	And baldness on every head;
AMO.8.10	I will make it like mourning for an only 
AMO.8.10	And its end like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord 
AMO.8.11	“That I will send a famine on the land,
AMO.8.11	Not a famine of bread,
AMO.8.11	Nor a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	But 
AMO.8.12	They shall wander from sea to sea,
AMO.8.12	And from north to east;
AMO.8.12	They shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the 
AMO.8.12	But shall 
AMO.8.13	“In that day the fair virgins
AMO.8.13	And strong young men
AMO.8.13	Shall faint from thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those who 
AMO.8.14	Who say,
AMO.8.14	‘As your god lives, O Dan!’
AMO.8.14	And, ‘As the way of 
AMO.8.14	They shall fall and never rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and He said:
AMO.9.1	“Strike the doorposts, that the thresholds may shake,
AMO.9.1	And 
AMO.9.1	I will slay the last of them with the sword.
AMO.9.1	He who flees from them shall not get away,
AMO.9.1	And he who escapes from them shall not be delivered.
AMO.9.2	“Though
AMO.9.2	From there My hand shall take them;
AMO.9.2	Though they climb up to heaven,
AMO.9.2	From there I will bring them down;
AMO.9.3	And though they 
AMO.9.3	From there I will search and take them;
AMO.9.3	Though they hide from My sight at the bottom of the sea,
AMO.9.3	From there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them;
AMO.9.4	Though they go into captivity before their enemies,
AMO.9.4	From there 
AMO.9.4	And it shall slay them.
AMO.9.4	I will set My eyes on them for harm and not for good.”
AMO.9.5	The Lord 
AMO.9.5	He who touches the earth and it 
AMO.9.5	And all who dwell there mourn;
AMO.9.5	All of it shall swell like the River,
AMO.9.5	And subside like the River of Egypt.
AMO.9.6	He who builds His 
AMO.9.6	And has founded His strata in the earth;
AMO.9.6	Who 
AMO.9.6	And pours them out on the face of the earth—
AMO.9.6	The 
AMO.9.7	“
AMO.9.7	O children of Israel?” says the 
AMO.9.7	“Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt,
AMO.9.7	The 
AMO.9.7	And the Syrians from 
AMO.9.8	“Behold, 
AMO.9.8	And I 
AMO.9.8	Yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,”
AMO.9.8	Says the 
AMO.9.9	“For surely I will command,
AMO.9.9	And will sift the house of Israel among all nations,
AMO.9.9	As 
AMO.9.9	Yet not the smallest grain shall fall to the ground.
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword,
AMO.9.10	Who say, ‘The calamity shall not overtake nor confront us.’
AMO.9.11	“On
AMO.9.11	The tabernacle of David, which has fallen down,
AMO.9.11	And repair its damages;
AMO.9.11	I will raise up its ruins,
AMO.9.11	And rebuild it as in the days of old;
AMO.9.12	That they may possess the remnant of 
AMO.9.12	And all the Gentiles who are called by My name,”
AMO.9.12	Says the 
AMO.9.13	“Behold, 
AMO.9.13	“When the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
AMO.9.13	And the treader of grapes him who sows seed;
AMO.9.13	The mountains shall drip with sweet wine,
AMO.9.13	And all the hills shall flow 
AMO.9.14	I will bring back the captives of My people Israel;
AMO.9.14	They shall build the waste cities and inhabit 
AMO.9.14	They shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them;
AMO.9.14	They shall also make gardens and eat fruit from them.
AMO.9.15	I will plant them in their land,
AMO.9.15	And no longer shall they be pulled up
AMO.9.15	From the land I have given them,”
AMO.9.15	Says the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah.
OBA.1.1	Thus says the Lord 
OBA.1.1	(We have heard a report from the 
OBA.1.1	And a messenger has been sent among the nations, 
OBA.1.1	“Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle”):
OBA.1.2	“Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
OBA.1.2	You shall be greatly despised.
OBA.1.3	The 
OBA.1.3	 who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
OBA.1.3	Whose habitation is high;
OBA.1.3	 who say in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’
OBA.1.4	Though you ascend 
OBA.1.4	And though you 
OBA.1.4	From there I will bring you down,” says the 
OBA.1.5	“If 
OBA.1.5	If robbers by night—
OBA.1.5	Oh, how you will be cut off!—
OBA.1.5	Would they not have stolen till they had enough?
OBA.1.5	If grape-gatherers had come to you,
OBA.1.5	Would they not have left 
OBA.1.6	“Oh, how Esau shall be searched out!
OBA.1.6	 his hidden treasures shall be sought after!
OBA.1.7	All the men in your confederacy
OBA.1.7	Shall force you to the border;
OBA.1.7	The men at peace with you

OBA.1.9	May be cut off by slaughter.
OBA.1.10	“For 
OBA.1.10	Shame shall cover you,
OBA.1.10	And 
OBA.1.11	In the day that you 
OBA.1.11	In the day that strangers carried captive his forces,
OBA.1.11	When foreigners entered his gates
OBA.1.11	And 
OBA.1.11	Even you 
OBA.1.12	“But you should not have 
OBA.1.12	In the day of his captivity;
OBA.1.12	Nor should you have 
OBA.1.12	In the day of their destruction;
OBA.1.12	Nor should you have spoken proudly
OBA.1.12	In the day of distress.
OBA.1.13	You should not have entered the gate of My people
OBA.1.13	In the day of their calamity.
OBA.1.13	Indeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction
OBA.1.13	In the day of their calamity,
OBA.1.13	Nor laid 
OBA.1.13	In the day of their calamity.
OBA.1.14	You should not have stood at the crossroads
OBA.1.14	To cut off those among them who escaped;
OBA.1.14	Nor should you have delivered up those among them who remained
OBA.1.14	In the day of distress.
OBA.1.15	“For
OBA.1.15	As you have done, it shall be done to you;
OBA.1.15	Your reprisal shall return upon your own head.
OBA.1.16	For as you drank on My holy mountain,
OBA.1.16	 shall all the nations drink continually;
OBA.1.16	Yes, they shall drink, and swallow,
OBA.1.16	And they shall be as though they had never been.
OBA.1.17	“But on Mount Zion there 
OBA.1.17	And there shall be holiness;
OBA.1.17	The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
OBA.1.18	The house of Jacob shall be a fire,
OBA.1.18	And the house of Joseph 
OBA.1.18	But the house of Esau 
OBA.1.18	They shall kindle them and devour them,
OBA.1.18	And no survivor shall

OBA.1.19	The South 
OBA.1.19	And the Lowland shall possess Philistia.
OBA.1.19	They shall possess the fields of Ephraim
OBA.1.19	And the fields of Samaria.
OBA.1.19	Benjamin 
OBA.1.20	And the captives of this host of the children of Israel
OBA.1.20	As 
OBA.1.20	The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
OBA.1.20	Shall possess the cities of the South.
OBA.1.21	Then 
OBA.1.21	To judge the mountains of Esau,
OBA.1.21	And the 
JON.1.1	Now the word of the 
JON.1.2	“Arise, go to 
JON.1.3	But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that 
JON.1.6	So the captain came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, 
JON.1.7	And they said to one another, “Come, let us

JON.1.9	So he said to them, “I 
JON.1.10	Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “Why have you done this?” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?”—for the sea was growing more tempestuous.
JON.1.12	And he said to them, 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, 
JON.1.14	Therefore they cried out to the 
JON.1.15	So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, 
JON.1.16	Then the men 
JON.1.17	Now the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	And he said:
JON.2.2	“I 
JON.2.2	And He answered me.
JON.2.2	“Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,
JON.2.2	 You heard my voice.
JON.2.3	For You cast me into the deep,
JON.2.3	Into the heart of the seas,
JON.2.3	And the floods surrounded me;
JON.2.3	All Your billows and Your waves passed over me.
JON.2.4	Then I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight;
JON.2.4	Yet I will look again 
JON.2.5	The 
JON.2.5	The deep closed around me;
JON.2.5	Weeds were wrapped around my head.
JON.2.6	I went down to the moorings of the mountains;

JON.2.10	So the 
JON.3.1	Now the word of the 
JON.3.2	“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you.” 
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the 
JON.3.4	And Jonah began to enter the city on the first day’s walk. Then 
JON.3.5	So the 
JON.3.6	Then word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe, covered 
JON.3.7	And he caused 
JON.3.7	Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; do not let them eat, or drink water. 
JON.3.8	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God; yes, 
JON.3.9	Who can tell 
JON.3.10	Then God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not do it.
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry. 
JON.4.2	So he prayed to the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O 
JON.4.4	Then the 
JON.4.5	So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. 
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it 
JON.4.8	And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, 
JON.4.9	Then God said to Jonah, “

MIC.1.7	All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,
MIC.1.7	And all her 
MIC.1.7	All her idols I will lay desolate,
MIC.1.7	For she gathered 
MIC.1.7	And they shall return to the 
MIC.1.8	Therefore I will wail and howl,
MIC.1.8	I will go stripped and naked;
MIC.1.8	I will make a wailing like the jackals
MIC.1.8	And a mourning like the ostriches,
MIC.1.9	For her wounds 
MIC.1.9	For 
MIC.1.9	It has come to the gate of My people—
MIC.1.9	To Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Tell 
MIC.1.10	Weep not at all;
MIC.1.10	In Beth Aphrah
MIC.1.10	Roll yourself in the dust.
MIC.1.11	Pass by in naked shame, you inhabitant of Shaphir;
MIC.1.11	The inhabitant of Zaanan does not go out.
MIC.1.11	Beth Ezel mourns;
MIC.1.11	Its place to stand is taken away from you.
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth pined for good,
MIC.1.12	But 
MIC.1.12	To the gate of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	O inhabitant of 
MIC.1.13	Harness the chariot to the swift steeds
MIC.1.13	(She 
MIC.1.13	For the transgressions of Israel were 
MIC.1.14	Therefore you shall 
MIC.1.14	The houses of 
MIC.1.15	I will yet bring an heir to you, O inhabitant of 
MIC.1.15	The glory of Israel shall come to 
MIC.1.16	Make yourself 
MIC.1.16	Because of your 
MIC.1.16	Enlarge your baldness like an eagle,
MIC.1.16	For they shall go from you into 
MIC.2.1	Woe to those who devise iniquity,
MIC.2.1	And work out evil on their beds!
MIC.2.1	At 
MIC.2.1	Because it is in the power of their hand.
MIC.2.2	They 
MIC.2.2	Also houses, and seize 
MIC.2.2	So they oppress a man and his house,
MIC.2.2	A man and his inheritance.
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus says the 
MIC.2.3	“Behold, against this 
MIC.2.3	From which you cannot remove your necks;
MIC.2.3	Nor shall you walk haughtily,
MIC.2.3	For this 
MIC.2.4	In that day 
MIC.2.4	And 
MIC.2.4	‘We are utterly destroyed!
MIC.2.4	He has changed the heritage of my people;
MIC.2.4	How He has removed 
MIC.2.4	To a turncoat He has divided our fields.’ ”
MIC.2.5	Therefore you will have no one to determine boundaries by lot
MIC.2.5	In the assembly of the 
MIC.2.6	“Do not prattle,” 
MIC.2.6	So they shall not prophesy to you;
MIC.2.6	They shall not return insult for insult.
MIC.2.7	“Is the Spirit of the 
MIC.2.7	 these His doings?
MIC.2.7	Do not My words do good
MIC.2.7	To him who walks uprightly?
MIC.2.8	“Lately My people have risen up as an enemy—
MIC.2.8	You pull off the robe with the garment
MIC.2.8	From those who trust 
MIC.2.8	Like men returned from war.
MIC.2.9	The women of My people you cast out
MIC.2.9	From their pleasant houses;
MIC.2.9	From their children
MIC.2.9	You have taken away My glory forever.
MIC.2.10	“Arise and depart,
MIC.2.10	For this 
MIC.2.10	Because it is 
MIC.2.10	Yes, with utter destruction.
MIC.2.11	If a man should walk in a false spirit
MIC.2.11	And speak a lie, 
MIC.2.11	‘I will prophesy to you of wine and drink,’
MIC.2.11	Even he would be the 
MIC.2.12	“I
MIC.2.12	I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;
MIC.2.12	I will put them together 
MIC.2.12	Like a flock in the midst of their pasture;
MIC.2.12	They shall make a loud noise because of 
MIC.2.13	The one who breaks open will come up before them;
MIC.2.13	They will break out,
MIC.2.13	Pass through the gate,
MIC.2.13	And go out by it;
MIC.2.13	Their king will pass before them,
MIC.2.13	With the 
MIC.3.1	And I said:
MIC.3.1	“Hear now, O heads of Jacob,
MIC.3.1	And you 
MIC.3.2	You who hate good and love evil;
MIC.3.2	Who strip the skin from My people,
MIC.3.2	And the flesh from their bones;
MIC.3.3	Who also 
MIC.3.3	Flay their skin from them,
MIC.3.3	Break their bones,
MIC.3.3	And chop 
MIC.3.3	Like 
MIC.3.3	Like flesh in the caldron.”
MIC.3.4	Then 
MIC.3.4	But He will not hear them;
MIC.3.4	He will even hide His face from them at that time,
MIC.3.4	Because they have been evil in their deeds.
MIC.3.5	Thus says the 
MIC.3.5	Who make my people stray;
MIC.3.5	Who chant “Peace”
MIC.3.5	While they 
MIC.3.5	But who prepare war against him
MIC.3.5	Who puts nothing into their mouths:
MIC.3.6	“Therefore
MIC.3.6	And you shall have darkness without divination;
MIC.3.6	The sun shall go down on the prophets,
MIC.3.6	And the day shall be dark for 
MIC.3.7	So the seers shall be ashamed,
MIC.3.7	And the diviners abashed;
MIC.3.7	Indeed they shall all cover their lips;
MIC.3.7	For 
MIC.3.8	But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.8	And of justice and might,
MIC.3.8	To declare to Jacob his transgression
MIC.3.8	And to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Now hear this,
MIC.3.9	You heads of the house of Jacob
MIC.3.9	And rulers of the house of Israel,
MIC.3.9	Who abhor justice
MIC.3.9	And pervert all equity,
MIC.3.10	Who build up Zion with 
MIC.3.10	And Jerusalem with iniquity:
MIC.3.11	Her heads judge for a bribe,
MIC.3.11	Her priests teach for pay,
MIC.3.11	And her prophets divine for money.
MIC.3.11	Yet they lean on the 
MIC.3.11	“Is not the 
MIC.3.11	No harm can come upon us.”
MIC.3.12	Therefore because of you
MIC.3.12	Zion shall be 
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins,
MIC.3.12	And 
MIC.3.12	Like the bare hills of the forest.
MIC.4.1	Now 
MIC.4.1	 the mountain of the 
MIC.4.1	Shall be established on the top of the mountains,
MIC.4.1	And shall be exalted above the hills;
MIC.4.1	And peoples shall flow to it.
MIC.4.2	Many nations shall come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	To the house of the God of Jacob;
MIC.4.2	He will teach us His ways,
MIC.4.2	And we shall walk in His paths.”
MIC.4.2	For out of Zion the law shall go forth,
MIC.4.2	And the word of the 
MIC.4.3	He shall judge between many peoples,
MIC.4.3	And rebuke strong nations afar off;
MIC.4.3	They shall beat their swords into 
MIC.4.3	And their spears into pruning hooks;
MIC.4.3	Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	Neither shall they learn war anymore.
MIC.4.4	But everyone shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree,
MIC.4.4	And no one shall make 
MIC.4.4	For the mouth of the 
MIC.4.5	For all people walk each in the name of his god,
MIC.4.5	But 
MIC.4.5	Forever and ever.
MIC.4.6	“In that day,” says the 
MIC.4.6	“I will assemble the lame,
MIC.4.6	I will gather the outcast
MIC.4.6	And those whom I have afflicted;
MIC.4.7	I will make the lame 
MIC.4.7	And the outcast a strong nation;
MIC.4.7	So the 
MIC.4.7	From now on, even forever.
MIC.4.8	And you, O tower of the flock,
MIC.4.8	The stronghold of the daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.8	To you shall it come,
MIC.4.8	Even the former dominion shall come,
MIC.4.8	The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.”
MIC.4.9	Now why do you cry aloud?
MIC.4.9	Has your counselor perished?
MIC.4.9	For 
MIC.4.10	Be in pain, and labor to bring forth,
MIC.4.10	O daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.10	Like a woman in birth pangs.
MIC.4.10	For now you shall go forth from the city,
MIC.4.10	You shall dwell in the field,
MIC.4.10	And to 
MIC.4.10	There you shall be delivered;
MIC.4.10	There the 
MIC.4.10	From the hand of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	Now also many nations have gathered against you,
MIC.4.11	Who say, “Let her be defiled,
MIC.4.11	And let our eye 
MIC.4.12	But they do not know 
MIC.4.12	Nor do they understand His counsel;
MIC.4.12	For He will gather them 
MIC.4.13	“Arise
MIC.4.13	For I will make your horn iron,
MIC.4.13	And I will make your hooves bronze;
MIC.4.13	You shall 
MIC.4.13	I will consecrate their gain to the 
MIC.4.13	And their substance to 
MIC.5.1	Now gather yourself in troops,
MIC.5.1	O daughter of troops;

MIC.5.2	 you are little 
MIC.5.2	 out of you shall come forth to Me
MIC.5.2	The One to be 
MIC.5.2	Whose goings forth 
MIC.5.2	From everlasting.”
MIC.5.3	Therefore He shall give them up,
MIC.5.3	Until the time 
MIC.5.3	Then 
MIC.5.3	Shall return to the children of Israel.
MIC.5.4	And He shall stand and 
MIC.5.4	In the strength of the 
MIC.5.4	In the majesty of the name of the

MIC.5.5	And this 
MIC.5.5	When the Assyrian comes into our land,
MIC.5.5	And when he treads in our palaces,
MIC.5.5	Then we will raise against him
MIC.5.5	Seven shepherds and eight princely men.
MIC.5.6	They shall waste with the sword the land of Assyria,
MIC.5.6	And the land of 
MIC.5.6	Thus He shall 
MIC.5.6	When he comes into our land
MIC.5.6	And when he treads within our borders.
MIC.5.7	Then 
MIC.5.7	Shall be in the midst of many peoples,
MIC.5.7	Like dew from the 
MIC.5.7	Like showers on the grass,
MIC.5.7	That tarry for no man
MIC.5.7	Nor wait for the sons of men.
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob
MIC.5.8	Shall be among the Gentiles,
MIC.5.8	In the midst of many peoples,
MIC.5.8	Like a 
MIC.5.8	Like a young lion among flocks of sheep,
MIC.5.8	Who, if he passes through,
MIC.5.8	Both treads down and tears in pieces,
MIC.5.8	And none can deliver.
MIC.5.9	Your hand shall be lifted against your adversaries,
MIC.5.9	And all your enemies shall be cut off.
MIC.5.10	“And it shall be in that day,” says the 
MIC.5.10	“That I will 
MIC.5.10	And destroy your 
MIC.5.11	I will cut off the cities of your land
MIC.5.11	And throw down all your strongholds.
MIC.5.12	I will cut off sorceries from your hand,

MIC.6.3	Testify against Me.
MIC.6.4	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
MIC.6.4	I redeemed you from the house of bondage;
MIC.6.4	And I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	O My people, remember now
MIC.6.5	What

HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	In the midst of the years make 
HAB.3.2	In wrath remember mercy.
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman,
HAB.3.3	The Holy One from Mount Paran.
HAB.3.3	His glory covered the heavens,
HAB.3.3	And the earth was full of His praise.
HAB.3.4	 brightness was like the light;
HAB.3.4	He had rays 
HAB.3.4	And there His power 
HAB.3.5	Before Him went pestilence,
HAB.3.5	And fever followed at His feet.
HAB.3.6	He stood and measured the earth;
HAB.3.6	He looked and startled the nations.
HAB.3.6	And the everlasting mountains were scattered,
HAB.3.6	The perpetual hills bowed.
HAB.3.6	His ways 
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;
HAB.3.7	The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
HAB.3.8	O 
HAB.3.8	 Your anger against the rivers,
HAB.3.8	 Your wrath against the sea,
HAB.3.8	That You rode on Your horses,
HAB.3.8	Your chariots of salvation?
HAB.3.9	Your bow was made quite ready;
HAB.3.9	Oaths were sworn over 
HAB.3.9	You divided the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw You 
HAB.3.10	The overflowing of the water passed by.
HAB.3.10	The deep uttered its voice,
HAB.3.11	The 
HAB.3.11	At the light of Your arrows they went,
HAB.3.11	At the shining of Your glittering spear.
HAB.3.12	You marched through the land in indignation;
HAB.3.12	You trampled the nations in anger.
HAB.3.13	You went forth for the salvation of Your people,
HAB.3.13	For salvation with Your Anointed.
HAB.3.13	You struck the head from the house of the wicked,
HAB.3.13	By laying bare from foundation to neck.
HAB.3.14	You thrust through with his own arrows
HAB.3.14	The head of his villages.
HAB.3.14	They came out like a whirlwind to scatter me;
HAB.3.14	Their rejoicing was like feasting on the poor in secret.
HAB.3.15	You walked through the sea with Your horses,
HAB.3.15	Through the heap of great waters.
HAB.3.16	When I heard, 
HAB.3.16	My lips quivered at 
HAB.3.16	Rottenness entered my bones;
HAB.3.16	And I trembled in myself,
HAB.3.16	That I might rest in the day of trouble.

MAT.1.5	Salmon begot 
MAT.1.6	and 
MAT.1.6	David the king begot Solomon by her

MAT.1.14	Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud. 
MAT.1.15	Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob. 
MAT.1.16	And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of 
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David 
MAT.1.18	Now the 
MAT.1.19	Then Joseph her husband, being a just 
MAT.1.20	But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, 
MAT.1.21	And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name 
MAT.1.22	So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: 
MAT.1.23	“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”
MAT.1.24	Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, 
MAT.1.25	and did not know her till she had brought forth 
MAT.2.1	Now after 
MAT.2.2	saying, 
MAT.2.3	When Herod the king heard 
MAT.2.4	And when he had gathered all 
MAT.2.5	So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:
MAT.2.6	‘But
MAT.2.6	Are not the least among the rulers of Judah;
MAT.2.6	For out of you shall come a Ruler
MAT.2.6	Who will shepherd My people Israel.’ ”
MAT.2.7	Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the 
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found 
MAT.2.9	When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. 
MAT.2.11	And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, 
MAT.2.12	Then, being divinely warned 
MAT.2.13	Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.”
MAT.2.14	When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, 
MAT.2.15	and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
MAT.2.18	“A 
MAT.2.18	Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
MAT.2.18	Rachel weeping 
MAT.2.18	Refusing to be comforted,
MAT.2.18	Because they are no more.”
MAT.2.19	Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
MAT.2.20	saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who 
MAT.2.21	Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a 
MAT.2.23	And he came and dwelt in a city called 
MAT.3.1	In those days 
MAT.3.2	and saying, “Repent, for 
MAT.3.3	For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:
MAT.3.3	“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
MAT.3.3	‘Prepare the way of the 
MAT.3.3	Make His paths straight.’ ”
MAT.3.4	Now 
MAT.3.5	Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him 
MAT.3.6	and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, 
MAT.3.8	Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, 
MAT.3.9	and do not think to say to yourselves, 
MAT.3.10	And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. 
MAT.3.11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. 
MAT.3.12	His winnowing fan 
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus came 
MAT.3.14	And John 
MAT.3.15	But Jesus answered and said to him, 
MAT.3.16	When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw 
MAT.3.17	And suddenly a voice 
MAT.4.1	Then 
MAT.4.2	And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. 
MAT.4.3	Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”
MAT.4.4	But He answered and said, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took Him up 
MAT.4.6	and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written:
MAT.4.6	‘He shall give His angels charge over you,’
MAT.4.6	and,
MAT.4.6	‘In 
MAT.4.6	Lest you dash your foot against a stone.’ ”
MAT.4.7	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and 
MAT.4.9	And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”
MAT.4.10	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil 
MAT.4.12	Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee. 
MAT.4.13	And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali, 
MAT.4.14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
MAT.4.15	“The
MAT.4.15	By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
MAT.4.15	Galilee of the Gentiles:
MAT.4.16	The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light,
MAT.4.16	And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death
MAT.4.16	Light has dawned.”
MAT.4.17	From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, 
MAT.4.18	And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon 
MAT.4.19	Then He said to them, 
MAT.4.20	They immediately left 
MAT.4.21	Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James 
MAT.4.22	and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
MAT.4.23	And Jesus went about all Galilee, 
MAT.4.24	Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they 
MAT.4.25	Great multitudes followed Him—from Galilee, and 
MAT.5.1	And seeing the multitudes, 
MAT.5.2	Then He opened His mouth and 
MAT.7.28	And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that 
MAT.7.29	for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
MAT.8.1	When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. 
MAT.8.2	And behold, a leper came and 
MAT.8.3	Then Jesus put out 
MAT.8.4	And Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.5	Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a 
MAT.8.6	saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”
MAT.8.7	And Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.8	The centurion answered and said, “Lord, 
MAT.8.9	For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this 
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus said to the centurion, 
MAT.8.14	Now when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, He saw 
MAT.8.15	So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.
MAT.8.16	When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, 
MAT.8.17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
MAT.8.17	“He Himself took our infirmities
MAT.8.17	And bore our sicknesses.”
MAT.8.18	And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side. 
MAT.8.19	Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”
MAT.8.20	And Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.21	Then another of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, 
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.23	Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. 
MAT.8.24	And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	Then His disciples came to 
MAT.8.26	But He said to them, 
MAT.8.27	So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”
MAT.8.28	When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed 
MAT.8.29	And suddenly they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”
MAT.8.30	Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding. 
MAT.8.31	So the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.”
MAT.8.32	And He said to them, “Go.” So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.
MAT.8.33	Then those who kept 
MAT.8.34	And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, 
MAT.9.1	So He got into a boat, crossed over, 
MAT.9.2	Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. 
MAT.9.3	And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, “This Man blasphemes!”
MAT.9.4	But Jesus, 
MAT.9.6	—then He said to the paralytic, 
MAT.9.7	And he arose and departed to his house.
MAT.9.8	Now when the multitudes saw 
MAT.9.9	As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, 
MAT.9.10	Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, 
MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw 
MAT.9.12	When Jesus heard 
MAT.9.14	Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, 
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.9.18	While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.” 
MAT.9.19	So Jesus arose and followed him, and so 
MAT.9.20	And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and 
MAT.9.21	For she said to herself, “If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.” 
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw 
MAT.9.24	He said to them, 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and 
MAT.9.26	And the 
MAT.9.27	When Jesus departed from there, 
MAT.9.28	And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.9.28	They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”
MAT.9.29	Then He touched their eyes, saying, 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, 
MAT.9.31	But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.
MAT.9.32	As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed. 
MAT.9.33	And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, “It was never seen like this in Israel!”
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, 
MAT.9.35	Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, 
MAT.9.36	But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, 
MAT.9.37	Then He said to His disciples, 
MAT.10.1	And 
MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Cananite, and Judas 
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: 
MAT.11.1	Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to 
MAT.11.2	And when John had heard 
MAT.11.3	and said to Him, “Are You 
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.11.7	As they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: 
MAT.11.17	and saying:
MAT.11.20	Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent: 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.12.1	At that time 
MAT.12.2	And when the Pharisees saw 
MAT.12.3	But He said to them, 
MAT.12.9	Now when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue. 
MAT.12.10	And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, 
MAT.12.11	Then He said to them, 
MAT.12.13	Then He said to the man, 
MAT.12.14	Then 
MAT.12.15	But when Jesus knew 
MAT.12.16	Yet He 
MAT.12.17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
MAT.12.18	“Behold! 
MAT.12.18	My Beloved 
MAT.12.18	I will put My Spirit upon Him,
MAT.12.18	And He will declare justice to the Gentiles.
MAT.12.19	He will not quarrel nor cry out,
MAT.12.19	Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	A bruised reed He will not break,
MAT.12.20	And smoking flax He will not quench,
MAT.12.20	Till He sends forth justice to victory;
MAT.12.21	And in His name Gentiles will trust.”
MAT.12.22	Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw. 
MAT.12.23	And all the multitudes were amazed and said, “Could this be the 
MAT.12.24	Now when the Pharisees heard 
MAT.12.25	But Jesus 
MAT.12.38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”
MAT.12.39	But He answered and said to them, 
MAT.12.44	Then he says, 
MAT.12.46	While He was still talking to the multitudes, 
MAT.12.47	Then one said to Him, “Look, 
MAT.12.48	But He answered and said to the one who told Him, 
MAT.12.49	And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, 
MAT.13.1	On the same day Jesus went out of the house 
MAT.13.2	And great multitudes were gathered together to Him, so that 
MAT.13.3	Then He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: 
MAT.13.10	And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”
MAT.13.11	He answered and said to them, 
MAT.13.24	Another parable He put forth to them, saying: 
MAT.13.31	Another parable He put forth to them, saying: 
MAT.13.33	Another parable He spoke to them: 
MAT.13.34	All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them, 
MAT.13.35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
MAT.13.35	“I will open My mouth in parables;
MAT.13.35	I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.”
MAT.13.36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.”
MAT.13.37	He answered and said to them: 
MAT.13.51	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.51	They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”
MAT.13.52	Then He said to them, 
MAT.13.53	Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there. 
MAT.13.54	When He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this 
MAT.13.55	Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And 
MAT.13.56	And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this 
MAT.13.57	So they 
MAT.13.57	But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.58	Now 
MAT.14.1	At that time 
MAT.14.2	and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” 
MAT.14.3	For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put 
MAT.14.4	Because John had said to him, 
MAT.14.5	And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, 
MAT.14.6	But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod. 
MAT.14.7	Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
MAT.14.8	So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, “Give me John the Baptist’s head here on a platter.”
MAT.14.9	And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded 
MAT.14.10	So he sent and had John beheaded in prison. 
MAT.14.11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought 
MAT.14.12	Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard 
MAT.14.14	And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He 
MAT.14.15	When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.14.17	And they said to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”
MAT.14.18	He said, 
MAT.14.19	Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, 
MAT.14.20	So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained. 
MAT.14.21	Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. 
MAT.14.23	And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. 
MAT.14.24	But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
MAT.14.25	Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. 
MAT.14.26	And when the disciples saw Him 
MAT.14.27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, 
MAT.14.28	And Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”
MAT.14.29	So He said, 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw that the wind 
MAT.14.31	And immediately Jesus stretched out 
MAT.14.32	And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
MAT.14.33	Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, “Truly 
MAT.14.34	When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick, 
MAT.14.36	and begged Him that they might only 
MAT.15.1	Then 
MAT.15.2	“Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”
MAT.15.3	He answered and said to them, 
MAT.15.8	 people 
MAT.15.10	When He had called the multitude to 
MAT.15.12	Then His disciples came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
MAT.15.13	But He answered and said, 
MAT.15.15	Then Peter answered and said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”
MAT.15.16	So Jesus said, 
MAT.15.21	Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, 
MAT.15.23	But He answered her not a word.
MAT.15.23	And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.”
MAT.15.24	But He answered and said, 
MAT.15.25	Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
MAT.15.26	But He answered and said, 
MAT.15.27	And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered and said to her, 
MAT.15.29	Jesus departed from there, 
MAT.15.30	Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them 
MAT.15.31	So the multitude marveled when they saw 
MAT.15.32	Now Jesus called His disciples to 
MAT.15.33	Then His disciples said to Him, “Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?”
MAT.15.34	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.15.34	And they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.”
MAT.15.35	So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	And 
MAT.15.37	So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left. 
MAT.15.38	Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 
MAT.15.39	And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.
MAT.16.1	Then the 
MAT.16.2	He answered and said to them, 
MAT.16.4	 And He left them and departed.
MAT.16.5	Now 
MAT.16.6	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.16.7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “
MAT.16.8	But Jesus, being aware of 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that He did not tell 
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, 
MAT.16.14	So they said, 
MAT.16.15	He said to them, 
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered and said, 
MAT.16.17	Jesus answered and said to him, 
MAT.16.20	Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time Jesus began 
MAT.16.22	Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!”
MAT.16.23	But He turned and said to Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to His disciples, 
MAT.17.1	Now 
MAT.17.2	and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. 
MAT.17.4	Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
MAT.17.5	While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, 
MAT.17.6	And when the disciples heard 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus came and 
MAT.17.8	When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
MAT.17.9	Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, 
MAT.17.10	And His disciples asked Him, saying, 
MAT.17.11	Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying, 
MAT.17.15	“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 
MAT.17.16	So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.”
MAT.17.17	Then Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.17.18	And Jesus 
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”
MAT.17.20	So Jesus said to them, 
MAT.17.22	Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.17.23	 And they were exceedingly 
MAT.17.24	When they had come to Capernaum, those who received the 
MAT.17.25	He said, “Yes.”
MAT.17.25	And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, 
MAT.17.26	Peter said to Him, “From strangers.”
MAT.17.26	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.18.1	At 
MAT.18.2	Then Jesus called a little 
MAT.18.3	and said, 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? 
MAT.18.22	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.19.1	Now it came to pass, 
MAT.19.2	And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.
MAT.19.3	The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for 
MAT.19.4	And He answered and said to them, 
MAT.19.7	They said to Him, 
MAT.19.8	He said to them, 
MAT.19.10	His disciples said to Him, 
MAT.19.11	But He said to them, 
MAT.19.13	Then little children were brought to Him that He might put 
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	And He laid 
MAT.19.16	Now behold, one came and said to Him, 
MAT.19.17	So He said to him, 
MAT.19.18	He said to Him, “Which ones?”
MAT.19.18	Jesus said, 
MAT.19.20	The young man said to Him, “All these things I have 
MAT.19.21	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
MAT.19.23	Then Jesus said to His disciples, 
MAT.19.25	When His disciples heard 
MAT.19.26	But Jesus looked at 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter answered and said to Him, “See, 
MAT.19.28	So Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.17	Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them, 
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of 
MAT.20.21	And He said to her, 
MAT.20.21	She said to Him, “Grant that these two sons of mine 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.20.22	They said to Him, “We are able.”
MAT.20.23	So He said to them, 
MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard 
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them to 
MAT.20.29	Now as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him. 
MAT.20.30	And behold, 
MAT.20.31	Then the multitude 
MAT.20.32	So Jesus stood still and called them, and said, 
MAT.20.33	They said to Him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” 
MAT.20.34	So Jesus had 
MAT.21.1	Now 
MAT.21.2	saying to them, 
MAT.21.4	All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
MAT.21.5	“Tell
MAT.21.5	‘Behold, your King is coming to you,
MAT.21.5	Lowly, and sitting on a donkey,
MAT.21.5	A colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ”
MAT.21.6	So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and the colt, 
MAT.21.8	And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; 
MAT.21.9	Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:
MAT.21.9	“Hosanna to the Son of David!
MAT.21.9	‘Blessed 
MAT.21.9	Hosanna in the highest!”
MAT.21.10	And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?”
MAT.21.11	So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, 
MAT.21.12	Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the 
MAT.21.13	And He said to them, 
MAT.21.14	Then 
MAT.21.15	But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the 
MAT.21.16	and said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?”
MAT.21.16	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.17	Then He left them and 
MAT.21.18	Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry. 
MAT.21.19	And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, 
MAT.21.20	And when the disciples saw 
MAT.21.21	So Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.21.23	Now when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him as He was teaching, and 
MAT.21.24	But Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.21.25	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘From men,’ we 
MAT.21.27	So they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.”
MAT.21.27	And He said to them, 
MAT.21.31	They said to Him, “The first.”
MAT.21.31	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.41	They said to Him, 
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.45	Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them. 
MAT.21.46	But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they 
MAT.22.1	And Jesus answered 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in 
MAT.22.16	And they sent to Him their disciples with the 
MAT.22.17	Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
MAT.22.18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, 
MAT.22.19	So they brought Him a denarius.
MAT.22.20	And He said to them, 
MAT.22.21	They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”
MAT.22.21	And He said to them, 
MAT.22.22	When they had heard 
MAT.22.23	The same day the Sadducees, 
MAT.22.24	saying: “Teacher, 
MAT.22.25	Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	Last of all the woman died also. 
MAT.22.28	Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.”
MAT.22.29	Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.22.33	And when the multitudes heard 
MAT.22.34	But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. 
MAT.22.35	Then one of them, 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which 
MAT.22.37	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
MAT.22.42	saying, 
MAT.22.42	They said to Him, “
MAT.22.43	He said to them, 
MAT.22.46	And no one was able to answer Him a word, 
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples, 
MAT.23.2	saying: 
MAT.23.13	“
MAT.24.1	Then 
MAT.24.2	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.24.3	Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, 
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and said to them: 
MAT.26.1	Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, 
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 
MAT.26.4	and 
MAT.26.5	But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the 
MAT.26.6	And when Jesus was in 
MAT.26.7	a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil, and she poured 
MAT.26.8	But when His disciples saw 
MAT.26.9	For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to 
MAT.26.10	But when Jesus was aware of 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, called 
MAT.26.15	and said, 
MAT.26.16	So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
MAT.26.17	Now on the first 
MAT.26.18	And He said, 
MAT.26.19	So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
MAT.26.20	When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve. 
MAT.26.21	Now as they were eating, He said, 
MAT.26.22	And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, “Lord, is it I?”
MAT.26.23	He answered and said, 
MAT.26.25	Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, “Rabbi, is it I?”
MAT.26.25	He said to him, 
MAT.26.26	And as they were eating, 
MAT.26.27	Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave 
MAT.26.30	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.26.33	Peter answered and said to Him, “Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.”
MAT.26.34	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.35	Peter said to Him, “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!”
MAT.26.35	And so said all the disciples.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, 
MAT.26.37	And He took with Him Peter and 
MAT.26.38	Then He said to them, 
MAT.26.39	He went a little farther and fell on His face, and 
MAT.26.40	Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, 
MAT.26.42	Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, 
MAT.26.43	And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
MAT.26.44	So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
MAT.26.45	Then He came to His disciples and said to them, 
MAT.26.47	And 
MAT.26.48	Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.” 
MAT.26.49	Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” 
MAT.26.50	But Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.50	Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. 
MAT.26.51	And suddenly, 
MAT.26.52	But Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.55	In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, 
MAT.26.56	Then 
MAT.26.57	And those who had laid hold of Jesus led 
MAT.26.58	But 
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought 
MAT.26.60	but found none. Even though 
MAT.26.61	and said, “This 
MAT.26.62	And the high priest arose and said to Him, “Do You answer nothing? What 
MAT.26.63	But 
MAT.26.64	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His 
MAT.26.66	What do you think?”
MAT.26.66	They answered and said, 
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in His face and beat Him; and 
MAT.26.68	saying, 
MAT.26.69	Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”
MAT.26.70	But he denied it before 
MAT.26.71	And when he had gone out to the gateway, another 
MAT.26.72	But again he denied with an oath, “I do not know the Man!”
MAT.26.73	And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, “Surely you also are 
MAT.26.74	Then 
MAT.26.74	Immediately a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, 
MAT.27.1	When morning came, 
MAT.27.2	And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and 
MAT.27.3	Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty 
MAT.27.4	saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”
MAT.27.4	And they said, “What 
MAT.27.5	Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and 
MAT.27.6	But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.” 
MAT.27.7	And they consulted together and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in. 
MAT.27.8	Therefore that field has been called 
MAT.27.9	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 
MAT.27.10	and 
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus stood before the governor. 
MAT.27.11	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.27.12	And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, 
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said to Him, 
MAT.27.14	But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
MAT.27.15	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished. 
MAT.27.16	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 
MAT.27.17	Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” 
MAT.27.18	For he knew that they had handed Him over because of 
MAT.27.19	While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.”
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. 
MAT.27.21	The governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”
MAT.27.21	They said, 
MAT.27.22	Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?”
MAT.27.22	 all said to him, “Let Him be crucified!”
MAT.27.23	Then the governor said, 
MAT.27.23	But they cried out all the more, saying, “Let Him be crucified!”
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather 
MAT.27.25	And all the people answered and said, 
MAT.27.26	Then he released Barabbas to them; and when 
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him. 
MAT.27.28	And they 
MAT.27.29	When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put 
MAT.27.30	Then 
MAT.27.31	And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His 
MAT.27.32	Now as they came out, 
MAT.27.33	And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull, 
MAT.27.34	they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But when He had tasted 
MAT.27.35	Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet:
MAT.27.35	“They divided My garments among them,
MAT.27.35	And for My clothing they cast lots.”
MAT.27.36	Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there. 
MAT.27.37	And they 
MAT.27.37	THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MAT.27.38	Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.
MAT.27.39	And 
MAT.27.40	and saying, 
MAT.27.41	Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said, 
MAT.27.42	“He 
MAT.27.43	He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”
MAT.27.44	Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land. 
MAT.27.46	And about the ninth hour 
MAT.27.47	Some of those who stood there, when they heard 
MAT.27.48	Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, 
MAT.27.49	The rest said, “Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.”
MAT.27.50	And Jesus 
MAT.27.51	Then, behold, 
MAT.27.52	and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 
MAT.27.53	and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
MAT.27.54	So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, 
MAT.27.55	And many women 
MAT.27.56	among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
MAT.27.57	Now 
MAT.27.58	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him. 
MAT.27.59	When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
MAT.27.60	and 
MAT.27.61	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
MAT.27.62	On the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, 
MAT.27.63	saying, “Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, 
MAT.27.64	Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go your way, make 
MAT.27.66	So they went and made the tomb secure, 
MAT.28.1	Now 
MAT.28.2	And behold, there was a great earthquake; for 
MAT.28.3	His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like 
MAT.28.5	But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here; for He is risen, 
MAT.28.7	And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed 
MAT.28.8	So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.
MAT.28.9	And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.28.11	Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. 
MAT.28.12	When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 
MAT.28.13	saying, “Tell them, ‘His disciples came at night and stole Him 
MAT.28.14	And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will appease him and make you secure.” 
MAT.28.15	So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
MAT.28.16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain 
MAT.28.17	When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some 
MAT.28.18	And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, 
MRK.1.1	The 
MRK.1.2	As it is written in the Prophets:
MRK.1.2	“Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,
MRK.1.2	Who will prepare Your way before You.”
MRK.1.3	“The
MRK.1.3	‘Prepare the way of the 
MRK.1.3	Make His paths straight.’ ”
MRK.1.4	John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
MRK.1.5	Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
MRK.1.6	Now John was 
MRK.1.7	And he preached, saying, 
MRK.1.8	I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you 
MRK.1.9	It came to pass in those days 
MRK.1.10	And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens parting and the Spirit 
MRK.1.11	Then a voice came from heaven, 
MRK.1.12	Immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness. 
MRK.1.13	And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; 
MRK.1.14	Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, 
MRK.1.15	and saying, 
MRK.1.16	And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 
MRK.1.17	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.1.18	They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
MRK.1.19	When He had gone a little farther from there, He saw James the 
MRK.1.20	And immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him.
MRK.1.21	Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the 
MRK.1.22	And they were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
MRK.1.23	Now there was a man in their synagogue with an 
MRK.1.24	saying, “Let 
MRK.1.25	But Jesus 
MRK.1.26	And when the unclean spirit 
MRK.1.27	Then they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? What new doctrine 
MRK.1.28	And immediately His 
MRK.1.29	Now as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
MRK.1.30	But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and they told Him about her at once. 
MRK.1.31	So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.
MRK.1.32	At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed. 
MRK.1.33	And the whole city was gathered together at the door. 
MRK.1.34	Then He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and 
MRK.1.35	Now 
MRK.1.36	And Simon and those 
MRK.1.37	When they found Him, they said to Him, 
MRK.1.38	But He said to them, 
MRK.1.39	And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and 
MRK.1.40	Now a leper came to Him, imploring Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”
MRK.1.41	Then Jesus, moved with 
MRK.1.42	As soon as He had spoken, 
MRK.1.43	And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once, 
MRK.1.44	and said to him, 
MRK.1.45	However, he went out and began to proclaim 
MRK.2.1	And again 
MRK.2.2	Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive 
MRK.2.3	Then they came to Him, bringing a 
MRK.2.4	And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, 
MRK.2.6	And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this 
MRK.2.8	But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, 
MRK.2.10	—He said to the paralytic, 
MRK.2.12	Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and 
MRK.2.13	Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them. 
MRK.2.14	As He passed by, He saw Levi the 
MRK.2.15	Now it happened, as He was dining in 
MRK.2.16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, “How 
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard 
MRK.2.18	The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, “Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.23	Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began 
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why do they do what is 
MRK.2.25	But He said to them, 
MRK.2.27	And He said to them, 
MRK.3.1	And 
MRK.3.2	So they 
MRK.3.3	And He said to the man who had the withered hand, 
MRK.3.4	Then He said to them, 
MRK.3.5	And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the 
MRK.3.6	Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with 
MRK.3.7	But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, 
MRK.3.8	and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how 
MRK.3.9	So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him. 
MRK.3.10	For He healed 
MRK.3.11	And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, 
MRK.3.12	But 
MRK.3.13	And He went up on the mountain and called to 
MRK.3.14	Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach, 
MRK.3.15	and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: 
MRK.3.16	Simon, 
MRK.3.17	James the 
MRK.3.18	Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house.
MRK.3.20	Then the multitude came together again, 
MRK.3.21	But when His 
MRK.3.22	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, 
MRK.3.23	So He called them to 
MRK.3.29	— 
MRK.3.30	because they 
MRK.3.31	Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. 
MRK.3.32	And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You.”
MRK.3.33	But He answered them, saying, 
MRK.3.34	And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, 
MRK.4.1	And 
MRK.4.2	Then He taught them many things by parables, 
MRK.4.9	And He said to them, 
MRK.4.10	But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable. 
MRK.4.11	And He said to them, 
MRK.4.13	And He said to them, 
MRK.4.21	Also He said to them, 
MRK.4.24	Then He said to them, 
MRK.4.26	And He said, 
MRK.4.30	Then He said, 
MRK.4.33	And with many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear 
MRK.4.34	But without a parable He did not speak to them. And when they were alone, 
MRK.4.35	On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, 
MRK.4.36	Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him. 
MRK.4.37	And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 
MRK.4.38	But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, 
MRK.4.39	Then He arose and 
MRK.4.40	But He said to them, 
MRK.4.41	And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!”
MRK.5.1	Then 
MRK.5.2	And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an 
MRK.5.3	who had 
MRK.5.4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him. 
MRK.5.5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.
MRK.5.6	When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him. 
MRK.5.7	And he cried out with a loud voice and said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I 
MRK.5.8	For He said to him, 
MRK.5.9	Then He asked him, 
MRK.5.9	And he answered, saying, “My name 
MRK.5.10	Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.
MRK.5.11	Now a large herd of 
MRK.5.12	So all the demons begged Him, saying, “Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.” 
MRK.5.13	And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.
MRK.5.14	So those who fed the swine fled, and they told 
MRK.5.15	Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one 
MRK.5.16	And those who saw it told them how it happened to him 
MRK.5.17	Then 
MRK.5.18	And when He got into the boat, 
MRK.5.19	However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, 
MRK.5.20	And he departed and began to 
MRK.5.21	Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea. 
MRK.5.22	And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet 
MRK.5.23	and begged Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and 
MRK.5.24	So 
MRK.5.25	Now a certain woman 
MRK.5.26	and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. 
MRK.5.27	When she heard about Jesus, she came behind 
MRK.5.28	For she said, “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.”
MRK.5.29	Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in 
MRK.5.30	And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that 
MRK.5.31	But His disciples said to Him, “You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, 
MRK.5.32	And He looked around to see her who had done this thing. 
MRK.5.33	But the woman, 
MRK.5.34	And He said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While He was still speaking, 
MRK.5.36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, 
MRK.5.37	And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who 
MRK.5.39	When He came in, He said to them, 
MRK.5.40	And they ridiculed Him. 
MRK.5.41	Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, 
MRK.5.42	Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years 
MRK.5.43	But 
MRK.6.1	Then 
MRK.6.2	And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing 
MRK.6.3	Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and 
MRK.6.4	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	Now He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed 
MRK.6.6	And 
MRK.6.7	And He called the twelve to 
MRK.6.8	He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bag, no bread, no copper in 
MRK.6.9	but 
MRK.6.10	Also He said to them, 
MRK.6.12	So they went out and preached that 
MRK.6.13	And they cast out many demons, 
MRK.6.14	Now King Herod heard 
MRK.6.15	Others said, “It is Elijah.”
MRK.6.15	And others said, “It is the Prophet, 
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard, he said, “This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!” 
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her. 
MRK.6.18	Because John had said to Herod, 
MRK.6.19	Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not; 
MRK.6.20	for Herod 
MRK.6.21	Then an opportune day came when Herod 
MRK.6.22	And when Herodias’ daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give 
MRK.6.23	He also swore to her, 
MRK.6.24	So she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?”
MRK.6.24	And she said, “The head of John the Baptist!”
MRK.6.25	Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceedingly sorry; 
MRK.6.27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison, 
MRK.6.28	brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When his disciples heard 
MRK.6.30	Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. 
MRK.6.31	And He said to them, 
MRK.6.32	So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.
MRK.6.33	But the multitudes saw them departing, and many 
MRK.6.34	And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like 
MRK.6.35	When the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, “This is a deserted place, and already the hour 
MRK.6.36	Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.”
MRK.6.37	But He answered and said to them, 
MRK.6.37	And they said to Him, 
MRK.6.38	But He said to them, 
MRK.6.38	And when they found out they said, 
MRK.6.39	Then He 
MRK.6.40	So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties. 
MRK.6.41	And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He 
MRK.6.42	So they all ate and were filled. 
MRK.6.43	And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish. 
MRK.6.44	Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away. 
MRK.6.46	And when He had sent them away, He 
MRK.6.47	Now when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He 
MRK.6.48	Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and 
MRK.6.49	And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a 
MRK.6.50	for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, 
MRK.6.51	Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind 
MRK.6.52	For 
MRK.6.53	When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there. 
MRK.6.54	And when they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him, 
MRK.6.55	ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was. 
MRK.6.56	Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that 
MRK.7.1	Then 
MRK.7.2	Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, with 
MRK.7.3	For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash 
MRK.7.5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?”
MRK.7.6	He answered and said to them, 
MRK.7.9	He said to them, 
MRK.7.14	When He had called all the multitude to 
MRK.7.17	When He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable. 
MRK.7.18	So He said to them, 
MRK.7.20	And He said, 
MRK.7.24	From there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered a house and wanted no one to know 
MRK.7.25	For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and 
MRK.7.26	The woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 
MRK.7.27	But Jesus said to her, 
MRK.7.28	And she answered and said to Him, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.”
MRK.7.29	Then He said to her, 
MRK.7.30	And when she had come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.
MRK.7.31	Again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He came through the midst of the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee. 
MRK.7.32	Then 
MRK.7.33	And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in his ears, and 
MRK.7.34	Then, 
MRK.7.35	Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly. 
MRK.7.36	Then 
MRK.7.37	And they were 
MRK.8.1	In those days, 
MRK.8.4	Then His disciples answered Him, “How can one satisfy these people with bread here in the wilderness?”
MRK.8.5	He asked them, 
MRK.8.5	And they said, “Seven.”
MRK.8.6	So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke 
MRK.8.7	They also had a few small fish; and 
MRK.8.8	So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets of leftover fragments. 
MRK.8.9	Now those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away, 
MRK.8.10	immediately got into the boat with His disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	Then the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him. 
MRK.8.12	But He 
MRK.8.13	And He left them, and getting into the boat again, departed to the other side. 
MRK.8.14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	Then He charged them, saying, 
MRK.8.16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “
MRK.8.17	But Jesus, being aware of 
MRK.8.19	They said to Him, “Twelve.”
MRK.8.20	And they said, “Seven.”
MRK.8.21	So He said to them, 
MRK.8.22	Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a 
MRK.8.23	So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when 
MRK.8.24	And he looked up and said, “I see men like trees, walking.”
MRK.8.25	Then He put 
MRK.8.26	Then He sent him away to his house, saying, 
MRK.8.27	Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, 
MRK.8.28	So they answered, 
MRK.8.29	He said to them, 
MRK.8.29	Peter answered and said to Him, 
MRK.8.30	Then He strictly warned them that they should tell no one about Him.
MRK.8.31	And 
MRK.8.32	He spoke this word openly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. 
MRK.8.33	But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He 
MRK.8.34	When He had called the people to 
MRK.9.1	And He said to them, 
MRK.9.2	Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them. 
MRK.9.3	His clothes became shining, exceedingly 
MRK.9.4	And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”— 
MRK.9.6	because he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.
MRK.9.7	And a 
MRK.9.8	Suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.
MRK.9.9	Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	So they kept this word to themselves, questioning 
MRK.9.11	And they asked Him, saying, “Why do the scribes say 
MRK.9.12	Then He answered and told them, 
MRK.9.14	And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them, and scribes disputing with them. 
MRK.9.15	Immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to 
MRK.9.16	And He asked the scribes, 
MRK.9.17	Then 
MRK.9.18	And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not.”
MRK.9.19	He answered him and said, 
MRK.9.20	Then they brought him to Him. And 
MRK.9.21	So He asked his father, 
MRK.9.21	And he said, “From childhood. 
MRK.9.22	And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”
MRK.9.23	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, “Lord, I believe; 
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He 
MRK.9.26	Then 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
MRK.9.28	And when He had come into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”
MRK.9.29	So He said to them, 
MRK.9.30	Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know 
MRK.9.31	For He taught His disciples and said to them, 
MRK.9.32	But they did not understand this saying, and were afraid to ask Him.
MRK.9.33	Then He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them, 
MRK.9.34	But they kept silent, for on the road they had 
MRK.9.35	And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, 
MRK.9.36	Then 
MRK.9.38	Now John answered Him, saying, “Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.”
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, 
MRK.10.1	Then 
MRK.10.2	The Pharisees came and asked Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce 
MRK.10.3	And He answered and said to them, 
MRK.10.4	They said, 
MRK.10.5	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.10.10	In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same 
MRK.10.11	So He said to them, 
MRK.10.13	Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought 
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw 
MRK.10.16	And He took them up in His arms, laid 
MRK.10.17	Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I 
MRK.10.18	So Jesus said to him, 
MRK.10.20	And he answered and said to Him, “Teacher, all these things I have 
MRK.10.21	Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, 
MRK.10.22	But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
MRK.10.23	Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, 
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, 
MRK.10.26	And they were greatly astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then can be saved?”
MRK.10.27	But Jesus looked at them and said, 
MRK.10.28	Then Peter began to say to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You.”
MRK.10.29	So Jesus answered and said, 
MRK.10.32	Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed. And as they followed they were afraid. 
MRK.10.35	Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.”
MRK.10.36	And He said to them, 
MRK.10.37	They said to Him, “Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.”
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.39	They said to Him, “We are able.”
MRK.10.39	So Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard 
MRK.10.42	But Jesus called them to 
MRK.10.46	Now they came to Jericho. As He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the road begging. 
MRK.10.47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, 
MRK.10.48	Then many warned him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.49	So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called.
MRK.10.49	Then they called the blind man, saying to him, “Be of good cheer. Rise, He is calling you.”
MRK.10.50	And throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	So Jesus answered and said to him, 
MRK.10.51	The blind man said to Him, “Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.”
MRK.10.52	Then Jesus said to him, 
MRK.11.1	Now 
MRK.11.2	and He said to them, 
MRK.11.4	So they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it. 
MRK.11.5	But some of those who stood there said to them, “What are you doing, loosing the colt?”
MRK.11.6	And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go. 
MRK.11.7	Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	And many spread their clothes on the road, and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread 
MRK.11.9	Then those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:
MRK.11.9	“Hosanna!
MRK.11.9	‘Blessed 
MRK.11.10	Blessed 
MRK.11.10	That comes in the name of the Lord!
MRK.11.10	Hosanna in the highest!”
MRK.11.11	And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
MRK.11.12	Now the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry. 
MRK.11.13	And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	In response Jesus said to it, 
MRK.11.14	And His disciples heard 
MRK.11.15	So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold 
MRK.11.16	And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple. 
MRK.11.17	Then He taught, saying to them, 
MRK.11.18	And 
MRK.11.19	When evening had come, He went out of the city.
MRK.11.20	Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. 
MRK.11.21	And Peter, remembering, said to Him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.”
MRK.11.22	So Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.11.27	Then they came again to Jerusalem. 
MRK.11.28	And they said to Him, “By what 
MRK.11.29	But Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.11.31	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they feared the people, for 
MRK.11.33	So they answered and said to Jesus, “We do not know.”
MRK.11.33	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.12.1	Then 
MRK.12.10	Have you not even read this Scripture:
MRK.12.12	And they sought to lay hands on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away.
MRK.12.13	Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in 
MRK.12.14	When they had come, they said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and care about no one; for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the 
MRK.12.15	Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?”
MRK.12.15	But He, knowing their 
MRK.12.16	So they brought 
MRK.12.16	And He said to them, 
MRK.12.17	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.12.17	And they marveled at Him.
MRK.12.18	Then 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, 
MRK.12.20	Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no offspring. 
MRK.12.21	And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise. 
MRK.12.22	So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also. 
MRK.12.23	Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.”
MRK.12.24	Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.12.28	Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?”
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered him, 
MRK.12.32	So the scribe said to Him, “Well 
MRK.12.33	And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, 
MRK.12.34	Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, 
MRK.12.34	But after that no one dared question Him.
MRK.12.35	Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, 
MRK.12.37	And the common people heard Him gladly.
MRK.12.38	Then 
MRK.12.41	Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money 
MRK.12.42	Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans. 
MRK.12.43	So He called His disciples to 
MRK.13.1	Then 
MRK.13.2	And Jesus answered and said to him, 
MRK.13.3	Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things be? And what 
MRK.13.5	And Jesus, answering them, began to say: 
MRK.14.1	After 
MRK.14.2	But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.”
MRK.14.3	And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured 
MRK.14.4	But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, “Why was this fragrant oil wasted? 
MRK.14.5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred 
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, 
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Him to them. 
MRK.14.11	And when they heard 
MRK.14.12	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover 
MRK.14.13	And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, 
MRK.14.16	So His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it just as He had said to them; and they prepared the Passover.
MRK.14.17	In the evening He came with the twelve. 
MRK.14.18	Now as they sat and ate, Jesus said, 
MRK.14.19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to Him one by one, “
MRK.14.20	He answered and said to them, 
MRK.14.22	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke 
MRK.14.23	Then He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave 
MRK.14.24	And He said to them, 
MRK.14.26	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.29	Peter said to Him, “Even if all are made to stumble, yet I 
MRK.14.30	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.14.31	But he spoke more vehemently, “If I have to die with You, I will not deny You!”
MRK.14.31	And they all said likewise.
MRK.14.32	Then they came to a place which was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, 
MRK.14.33	And He 
MRK.14.34	Then He said to them, 
MRK.14.35	He went a little farther, and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him. 
MRK.14.36	And He said, 
MRK.14.37	Then He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, 
MRK.14.39	Again He went away and prayed, and spoke the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And when He returned, He found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.
MRK.14.41	Then He came the third time and said to them, 
MRK.14.43	And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
MRK.14.44	Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I 
MRK.14.45	As soon as he had come, immediately he went up to Him and said to Him, “Rabbi, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.
MRK.14.46	Then they laid their hands on Him and took Him. 
MRK.14.47	And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
MRK.14.48	Then Jesus answered and said to them, 
MRK.14.50	Then they all forsook Him and fled.
MRK.14.51	Now a certain young man followed Him, having a linen cloth thrown around 
MRK.14.52	and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.
MRK.14.53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were 
MRK.14.54	But 
MRK.14.55	Now the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none. 
MRK.14.56	For many bore 
MRK.14.57	Then some rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying, 
MRK.14.58	“We heard Him say, 
MRK.14.59	But not even then did their testimony agree.
MRK.14.60	And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, “Do You answer nothing? What 
MRK.14.61	But 
MRK.14.61	Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”
MRK.14.62	Jesus said, 
MRK.14.63	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “What further need do we have of witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	You have heard the 
MRK.14.64	And they all condemned Him to be deserving of 
MRK.14.65	Then some began to 
MRK.14.66	Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came. 
MRK.14.67	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with 
MRK.14.68	But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are saying.” And he went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed.
MRK.14.69	And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, “This is 
MRK.14.70	But he denied it again.
MRK.14.70	And a little later those who stood by said to Peter again, “Surely you are 
MRK.14.71	Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this Man of whom you speak!”
MRK.14.72	A second time 
MRK.15.1	Immediately, 
MRK.15.2	Then Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”
MRK.15.2	He answered and said to him, 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He 
MRK.15.4	Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, “Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!” 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.
MRK.15.6	Now 
MRK.15.7	And there was one named Barabbas, 
MRK.15.8	Then the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask 
MRK.15.9	But Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.
MRK.15.11	But 
MRK.15.12	Pilate answered and said to them again, “What then do you want me to do 
MRK.15.13	So they cried out again, “Crucify Him!”
MRK.15.14	Then Pilate said to them, “Why, 
MRK.15.14	But they cried out all the more, “Crucify Him!”
MRK.15.15	So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged 
MRK.15.16	Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison. 
MRK.15.17	And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His 
MRK.15.18	and began to salute Him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	Then they 
MRK.15.20	And when they had 
MRK.15.21	Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross. 
MRK.15.22	And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. 
MRK.15.23	Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take 
MRK.15.24	And when they crucified Him, 
MRK.15.25	Now 
MRK.15.26	And 
MRK.15.26	THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MRK.15.27	With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. 
MRK.15.28	So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 
MRK.15.29	And 
MRK.15.30	save Yourself, and come down from the cross!”
MRK.15.31	Likewise the chief priests also, 
MRK.15.32	Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.”
MRK.15.32	Even 
MRK.15.33	Now 
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 
MRK.15.35	Some of those who stood by, when they heard 
MRK.15.36	Then 
MRK.15.37	And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.
MRK.15.38	Then 
MRK.15.39	So 
MRK.15.40	There were also women looking on 
MRK.15.41	who also 
MRK.15.42	Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who 
MRK.15.44	Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. 
MRK.15.45	So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary 
MRK.16.1	Now 
MRK.16.2	Very early in the morning, on the first 
MRK.16.3	And they said among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?” 
MRK.16.4	But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away—for it was very large. 
MRK.16.5	And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
MRK.16.6	But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell His disciples—and Peter—that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, 
MRK.16.8	So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. 
MRK.16.9	Now when 
MRK.16.10	She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept. 
MRK.16.11	And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
MRK.16.12	After that, He appeared in another form 
MRK.16.13	And they went and told 
MRK.16.14	Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. 
MRK.16.15	And He said to them, 
MRK.16.19	So then, 
MRK.16.20	And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with 
LUK.1.1	Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those 
LUK.1.2	just as those who 
LUK.1.3	it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, 
LUK.1.4	that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.
LUK.1.5	There was 
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
LUK.1.7	But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.
LUK.1.8	So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division, 
LUK.1.9	according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell 
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense. 
LUK.1.11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of 
LUK.1.12	And when Zacharias saw 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and 
LUK.1.14	And you will have joy and gladness, and 
LUK.1.15	For he will be 
LUK.1.16	And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
LUK.1.18	And Zacharias said to the angel, 
LUK.1.19	And the angel answered and said to him, “I am 
LUK.1.20	But behold, 
LUK.1.21	And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple. 
LUK.1.22	But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he beckoned to them and remained speechless.
LUK.1.23	So it was, as soon as 
LUK.1.24	Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, 
LUK.1.25	“Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on 
LUK.1.26	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin 
LUK.1.28	And having come in, the angel said to her, 
LUK.1.29	But when she saw 
LUK.1.30	Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found 
LUK.1.31	And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and 
LUK.1.32	He will be great, 
LUK.1.33	And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.”
LUK.1.34	Then Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I do not know a man?”
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and said to her, 
LUK.1.36	Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren. 
LUK.1.37	For 
LUK.1.38	Then Mary said, “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.
LUK.1.39	Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, 
LUK.1.40	and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was 
LUK.1.42	Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, 
LUK.1.43	But why 
LUK.1.44	For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
LUK.1.45	Blessed 
LUK.1.46	And Mary said:
LUK.1.46	“My soul magnifies the Lord,
LUK.1.47	And my spirit has 
LUK.1.48	For 
LUK.1.48	For behold, henceforth 
LUK.1.49	For He who is mighty 
LUK.1.49	And 
LUK.1.50	And 
LUK.1.50	From generation to generation.
LUK.1.51	He has shown strength with His arm;
LUK.1.51	He has scattered 
LUK.1.52	He has put down the mighty from 
LUK.1.52	And exalted 
LUK.1.53	He has 
LUK.1.53	And 
LUK.1.54	He has helped His 
LUK.1.54	In remembrance of 
LUK.1.55	As He spoke to our 
LUK.1.55	To Abraham and to his 
LUK.1.56	And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.
LUK.1.57	Now Elizabeth’s full time came for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son. 
LUK.1.58	When her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they 
LUK.1.59	So it was, 
LUK.1.60	His mother answered and said, 
LUK.1.61	But they said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.” 
LUK.1.62	So they made signs to his father—what he would have him called.
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, “His name is John.” So they all marveled. 
LUK.1.64	Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue 
LUK.1.65	Then fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea. 
LUK.1.66	And all those who heard 
LUK.1.67	Now his father Zacharias 
LUK.1.68	“Blessed
LUK.1.68	For 
LUK.1.69	And has raised up a horn of salvation for us
LUK.1.69	In the house of His servant David,
LUK.1.70	As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets,
LUK.1.70	Who 
LUK.1.71	That we should be saved from our enemies
LUK.1.71	And from the hand of all who hate us,
LUK.1.72	To perform the mercy 
LUK.1.72	And to remember His holy covenant,
LUK.1.73	The oath which He swore to our father Abraham:
LUK.1.74	To grant us that we,
LUK.1.74	Being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	Might 
LUK.1.75	In holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
LUK.1.76	“And you, child, will be called the 
LUK.1.76	For 
LUK.1.77	To give 
LUK.1.77	By the remission of their sins,
LUK.1.78	Through the tender mercy of our God,
LUK.1.78	With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;
LUK.1.79	To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,
LUK.1.79	To 
LUK.1.80	So 
LUK.2.1	And it came to pass in those days 
LUK.2.2	This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. 
LUK.2.3	So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.
LUK.2.4	Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to 
LUK.2.5	to be registered with Mary, 
LUK.2.6	So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. 
LUK.2.7	And 
LUK.2.8	Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
LUK.2.9	And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, 
LUK.2.10	Then the angel said to them, 
LUK.2.11	For there is born to you this day in the city of David 
LUK.2.12	And this 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
LUK.2.14	“Glory
LUK.2.14	And on earth 
LUK.2.15	So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, “Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.” 
LUK.2.16	And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger. 
LUK.2.17	Now when they had seen 
LUK.2.18	And all those who heard 
LUK.2.19	But Mary kept all these things and pondered 
LUK.2.20	Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and 
LUK.2.21	And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called 
LUK.2.22	Now when 
LUK.2.23	(as it is written in the law of the Lord, 
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, 
LUK.2.25	And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name 
LUK.2.26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not 
LUK.2.27	So he came 
LUK.2.28	he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:
LUK.2.29	“Lord, 
LUK.2.29	According to Your word;
LUK.2.30	For my eyes 
LUK.2.31	Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,
LUK.2.32	A light to 
LUK.2.32	And the glory of Your people Israel.”
LUK.2.33	And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him. 
LUK.2.34	Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this 
LUK.2.35	(yes, 
LUK.2.36	Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of 
LUK.2.37	and this woman 
LUK.2.38	And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all those who 
LUK.2.39	So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their 
LUK.2.40	And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
LUK.2.41	His parents went to 
LUK.2.42	And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the 
LUK.2.43	When they had finished the 
LUK.2.44	but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought Him among 
LUK.2.45	So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. 
LUK.2.46	Now so it was 
LUK.2.47	And 
LUK.2.48	So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.”
LUK.2.49	And He said to them, 
LUK.2.50	But 
LUK.2.51	Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, but His mother 
LUK.2.52	And Jesus 
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, 
LUK.3.2	while 
LUK.3.3	And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance 
LUK.3.4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying:
LUK.3.4	“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
LUK.3.4	‘Prepare the way of the 
LUK.3.4	Make His paths straight.
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled
LUK.3.5	And every mountain and hill brought low;
LUK.3.5	The crooked places shall be made straight
LUK.3.5	And the rough ways smooth;
LUK.3.6	And 
LUK.3.7	Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, 
LUK.3.8	Therefore bear fruits 
LUK.3.9	And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore 
LUK.3.10	So the people asked him, saying, 
LUK.3.11	He answered and said to them, 
LUK.3.12	Then 
LUK.3.13	And he said to them, 
LUK.3.14	Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying, “And what shall we do?”
LUK.3.14	So he said to them, “Do not intimidate anyone 
LUK.3.15	Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ 
LUK.3.16	John answered, saying to all, 
LUK.3.17	His winnowing fan 
LUK.3.18	And with many other exhortations he preached to the people. 
LUK.3.19	But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, 
LUK.3.20	also added this, above all, that he shut John up in prison.
LUK.3.21	When all the people were baptized, 
LUK.3.22	And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said, “You are My beloved Son; in You I am 
LUK.3.23	Now Jesus Himself began 
LUK.4.1	Then 
LUK.4.2	being tempted for forty days by the devil. And 
LUK.4.3	And the devil said to Him, “If You are 
LUK.4.4	But Jesus answered him, saying, 
LUK.4.5	Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
LUK.4.6	And the devil said to Him, “All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for 
LUK.4.7	Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.”
LUK.4.8	And Jesus answered and said to him, 
LUK.4.9	Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here. 
LUK.4.10	For it is written:
LUK.4.10	‘He shall give His angels charge over you,
LUK.4.10	To keep you,’
LUK.4.11	and,
LUK.4.11	‘In 
LUK.4.11	Lest you dash your foot against a stone.’ ”
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answered and said to him, 
LUK.4.13	Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him 
LUK.4.14	Then Jesus returned 
LUK.4.15	And He 
LUK.4.16	So He came to 
LUK.4.17	And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:
LUK.4.20	Then He closed the book, and gave 
LUK.4.21	And He began to say to them, 
LUK.4.22	So all bore witness to Him, and 
LUK.4.23	He said to them, 
LUK.4.24	Then He said, 
LUK.4.28	So all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were 
LUK.4.29	and rose up and thrust Him out of the city; and they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw Him down over the cliff. 
LUK.4.30	Then 
LUK.4.31	Then 
LUK.4.32	And they were 
LUK.4.33	Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	saying, “Let 
LUK.4.35	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
LUK.4.36	Then they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, “What a word this 
LUK.4.37	And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
LUK.4.38	Now He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. But Simon’s wife’s mother was sick with a high fever, and they 
LUK.4.39	So He stood over her and 
LUK.4.40	When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them. 
LUK.4.41	And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, 
LUK.4.41	And He, 
LUK.4.42	Now when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowd sought Him and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from leaving them; 
LUK.4.43	but He said to them, 
LUK.4.44	And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
LUK.5.1	So 
LUK.5.2	and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing 
LUK.5.3	Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He 
LUK.5.4	When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, 
LUK.5.5	But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught 
LUK.5.6	And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. 
LUK.5.7	So they signaled to 
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw 
LUK.5.9	For he and all who were with him were 
LUK.5.10	and so also 
LUK.5.11	So when they had brought their boats to land, 
LUK.5.12	And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who was full of 
LUK.5.13	Then He put out 
LUK.5.14	And He charged him to tell no one, 
LUK.5.15	However, 
LUK.5.16	So He Himself 
LUK.5.17	Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was 
LUK.5.18	Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him. 
LUK.5.19	And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with 
LUK.5.20	When He saw their faith, He said to him, 
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? 
LUK.5.22	But when Jesus 
LUK.5.24	—He said to the man who was paralyzed, 
LUK.5.25	Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, 
LUK.5.26	And they were all amazed, and they 
LUK.5.27	After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, 
LUK.5.28	So he left all, rose up, and 
LUK.5.29	Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And 
LUK.5.30	And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, 
LUK.5.31	Jesus answered and said to them, 
LUK.5.33	Then they said to Him, 
LUK.5.34	And He said to them, 
LUK.5.36	Then He spoke a parable to them: 
LUK.6.1	Now 
LUK.6.2	And some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why are you doing 
LUK.6.3	But Jesus answering them said, 
LUK.6.5	And He said to them, 
LUK.6.6	Now it happened on another Sabbath, also, that He entered the synagogue and taught. And a man was there whose right hand was withered. 
LUK.6.7	So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely, whether He would 
LUK.6.8	But He 
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.10	And when He had looked around at them all, He said to the man, 
LUK.6.11	But they were filled with rage, and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	Now it came to pass in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all night in 
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, He called His disciples to 
LUK.6.14	Simon, 
LUK.6.15	Matthew and Thomas; James the 
LUK.6.16	Judas 
LUK.6.17	And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples 
LUK.6.18	as well as those who were tormented with unclean spirits. And they were healed. 
LUK.6.19	And the whole multitude 
LUK.6.20	Then He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said:
LUK.6.39	And He spoke a parable to them: 
LUK.7.1	Now when He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He 
LUK.7.2	And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. 
LUK.7.3	So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant. 
LUK.7.4	And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving, 
LUK.7.5	“for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.”
LUK.7.6	Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof. 
LUK.7.7	Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man placed under 
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, 
LUK.7.10	And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.
LUK.7.11	Now it happened, the day after, 
LUK.7.12	And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, He had 
LUK.7.14	Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried 
LUK.7.15	So he who was dead 
LUK.7.16	Then fear came upon all, and they 
LUK.7.17	And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.
LUK.7.18	Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. 
LUK.7.19	And John, calling two of his disciples to 
LUK.7.20	When the men had come to Him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, ‘Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?’ ” 
LUK.7.21	And that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight.
LUK.7.22	Jesus answered and said to them, 
LUK.7.24	When the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: 
LUK.7.29	And when all the people heard 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected 
LUK.7.31	And the Lord said, 
LUK.7.36	Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat. 
LUK.7.37	And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that 
LUK.7.38	and stood at His feet behind 
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw 
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answered and said to him, 
LUK.7.40	So he said, “Teacher, say it.”
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and said, “I suppose the 
LUK.7.43	And He said to him, 
LUK.7.44	Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, 
LUK.7.48	Then He said to her, 
LUK.7.49	And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, 
LUK.7.50	Then He said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	Now it came to pass, afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the twelve 
LUK.8.2	and 
LUK.8.3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for Him from their substance.
LUK.8.4	And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable: 
LUK.8.8	 When He had said these things He cried, 
LUK.8.9	Then His disciples asked Him, saying, “What does this parable mean?”
LUK.8.10	And He said, 
LUK.8.19	Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	And it was told Him 
LUK.8.21	But He answered and said to them, 
LUK.8.22	Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, 
LUK.8.23	But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling 
LUK.8.24	And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!”
LUK.8.24	Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. 
LUK.8.25	But He said to them, 
LUK.8.25	And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, 
LUK.8.26	Then they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs. 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he 
LUK.8.29	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.
LUK.8.30	Jesus asked him, saying, 
LUK.8.30	And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him. 
LUK.8.31	And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out 
LUK.8.32	Now a herd of many 
LUK.8.33	Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned.
LUK.8.34	When those who fed 
LUK.8.35	Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, 
LUK.8.36	They also who had seen 
LUK.8.37	Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes 
LUK.8.38	Now 
LUK.8.39	 And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him. 
LUK.8.41	And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged Him to come to his house, 
LUK.8.42	for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she 
LUK.8.42	But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him. 
LUK.8.43	Now a woman, having a 
LUK.8.44	came from behind and 
LUK.8.45	And Jesus said, 
LUK.8.45	When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, 
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.
LUK.8.48	And He said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s 
LUK.8.50	But when Jesus heard 
LUK.8.51	When He came into the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl. 
LUK.8.52	Now all wept and mourned for her; but He said, 
LUK.8.53	And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead.
LUK.8.54	But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying, 
LUK.8.55	Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given 
LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished, but 
LUK.9.1	Then 
LUK.9.2	He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	And He said to them, 
LUK.9.6	So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, 
LUK.9.8	and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. 
LUK.9.9	Herod said, “John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?” 
LUK.9.10	And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. 
LUK.9.11	But when the multitudes knew 
LUK.9.12	When the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.”
LUK.9.13	But He said to them, 
LUK.9.13	And they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.” 
LUK.9.14	For there were about five thousand men.
LUK.9.14	Then He said to His disciples, 
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit down.
LUK.9.16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He 
LUK.9.17	So they all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.
LUK.9.18	And it happened, as He was alone praying, 
LUK.9.19	So they answered and said, 
LUK.9.20	He said to them, 
LUK.9.20	Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”
LUK.9.21	And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one, 
LUK.9.22	saying, 
LUK.9.23	Then He said to 
LUK.9.28	Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe 
LUK.9.30	And behold, two men talked with Him, who were 
LUK.9.31	who appeared in glory and spoke of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	But Peter and those with him 
LUK.9.33	Then it happened, as they were parting from Him, 
LUK.9.34	While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the 
LUK.9.35	And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, 
LUK.9.36	When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. 
LUK.9.37	Now it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him. 
LUK.9.38	Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying, “Teacher, I implore You, look on my son, for he is my only child. 
LUK.9.39	And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams 
LUK.9.40	So I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”
LUK.9.41	Then Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.9.42	And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed 
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.
LUK.9.43	But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples, 
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.
LUK.9.46	Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest. 
LUK.9.47	And Jesus, 
LUK.9.48	and said to them, 
LUK.9.49	Now John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.”
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.51	Now it came to pass, when the time had come for 
LUK.9.52	and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him. 
LUK.9.53	But 
LUK.9.54	And when His disciples 
LUK.9.55	But He turned and rebuked them, and said, 
LUK.9.56	 And they went to another village.
LUK.9.57	Now it happened as they journeyed on the road, 
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.59	Then He said to another, 
LUK.9.59	But he said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
LUK.9.60	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.61	And another also said, “Lord, 
LUK.9.62	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.1	After these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and 
LUK.10.2	Then He said to them, 
LUK.10.17	Then 
LUK.10.18	And He said to them, 
LUK.10.21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, 
LUK.10.23	Then He turned to 
LUK.10.25	And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, 
LUK.10.26	He said to him, 
LUK.10.27	So he answered and said, “ 
LUK.10.28	And He said to him, 
LUK.10.29	But he, wanting to 
LUK.10.30	Then Jesus answered and said: 
LUK.10.37	And he said, “He who showed mercy on him.”
LUK.10.37	Then Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.38	Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named 
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Mary, 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.”
LUK.10.41	And Jesus answered and said to her, 
LUK.11.1	Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, 
LUK.11.2	So He said to them, 
LUK.11.5	And He said to them, 
LUK.11.14	And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled. 
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, 
LUK.11.16	Others, testing 
LUK.11.17	But 
LUK.11.27	And it happened, as He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, 
LUK.11.28	But He said, 
LUK.11.29	And while the crowds were thickly gathered together, He began to say, 
LUK.11.37	And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. So He went in and sat down to eat. 
LUK.11.38	When the Pharisee saw 
LUK.11.39	Then the Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.45	Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, “Teacher, by saying these things You reproach us also.”
LUK.11.46	And He said, 
LUK.11.53	And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to assail 
LUK.11.54	lying in wait for Him, and 
LUK.12.1	In 
LUK.12.13	Then one from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
LUK.12.14	But He said to him, 
LUK.12.15	And He said to them, 
LUK.12.16	Then He spoke a parable to them, saying: 
LUK.12.22	Then He said to His disciples, 
LUK.12.41	Then Peter said to Him, “Lord, do You speak this parable 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, 
LUK.12.54	Then He also said to the multitudes, 
LUK.13.1	There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
LUK.13.6	He also spoke this parable: 
LUK.13.10	Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 
LUK.13.11	And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise 
LUK.13.12	But when Jesus saw her, He called 
LUK.13.13	And He laid 
LUK.13.14	But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had 
LUK.13.15	The Lord then answered him and said, 
LUK.13.17	And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were 
LUK.13.18	Then He said, 
LUK.13.20	And again He said, 
LUK.13.22	And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	Then one said to Him, “Lord, are there 
LUK.13.23	And He said to them, 
LUK.13.31	On that very day some Pharisees came, saying to Him, “Get out and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You.”
LUK.13.32	And He said to them, 
LUK.13.35	!’ ”
LUK.14.1	Now it happened, as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, that they watched Him closely. 
LUK.14.2	And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy. 
LUK.14.3	And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, 
LUK.14.4	But they kept silent. And He took 
LUK.14.5	Then He answered them, saying, 
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer Him regarding these things.
LUK.14.7	So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them: 
LUK.14.12	Then He also said to him who invited Him, 
LUK.14.15	Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, 
LUK.14.16	Then He said to him, 
LUK.14.25	Now great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them, 
LUK.15.1	Then 
LUK.15.2	And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, “This Man receives sinners 
LUK.15.3	So He spoke this parable to them, saying:
LUK.15.11	Then He said: 
LUK.16.1	He also said to His disciples: 
LUK.16.14	Now the Pharisees, 
LUK.16.15	And He said to them, 
LUK.16.27	“Then he said, 
LUK.17.1	Then He said to the disciples, 
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”
LUK.17.6	So the Lord said, 
LUK.17.11	Now it happened 
LUK.17.12	Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, 
LUK.17.13	And they lifted up 
LUK.17.14	So when He saw 
LUK.17.15	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice 
LUK.17.16	and fell down on 
LUK.17.17	So Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.17.19	And He said to him, 
LUK.17.20	Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, 
LUK.17.22	Then He said to the disciples, 
LUK.17.37	And they answered and said to Him, 
LUK.17.37	So He said to them, 
LUK.18.1	Then He spoke a parable to them, that men 
LUK.18.2	saying: 
LUK.18.6	Then the Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	Also He spoke this parable to some 
LUK.18.15	Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them to 
LUK.18.18	Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.18.19	So Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.21	And he said, “All 
LUK.18.22	So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, 
LUK.18.23	But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.
LUK.18.24	And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, 
LUK.18.26	And those who heard it said, “Who then can be saved?”
LUK.18.27	But He said, 
LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, “See, we have left all and followed You.”
LUK.18.29	So He said to them, 
LUK.18.31	Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, 
LUK.18.34	But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.
LUK.18.35	Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging. 
LUK.18.36	And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. 
LUK.18.37	So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 
LUK.18.38	And he cried out, saying, “Jesus, 
LUK.18.39	Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.40	So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him, 
LUK.18.41	saying, 
LUK.18.41	He said, “Lord, that I may receive my sight.”
LUK.18.42	Then Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, 
LUK.19.1	Then 
LUK.19.2	Now behold, 
LUK.19.3	And he sought to 
LUK.19.4	So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that 
LUK.19.5	And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, 
LUK.19.6	So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	But when they saw 
LUK.19.8	Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the 
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.19.11	Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because 
LUK.19.12	Therefore He said: 
LUK.19.20	“Then another came, saying, 
LUK.19.28	When He had said this, 
LUK.19.29	And it came to pass, when He drew near to Bethphage and 
LUK.19.30	saying, 
LUK.19.32	So those who were sent went their way and found 
LUK.19.33	But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, “Why are you loosing the colt?”
LUK.19.34	And they said, “The Lord has need of him.” 
LUK.19.35	Then they brought him to Jesus. 
LUK.19.36	And as He went, 
LUK.19.37	Then, as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to 
LUK.19.38	saying:
LUK.19.38	“ ‘Blessed 
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.”
LUK.19.40	But He answered and said to them, 
LUK.19.41	Now as He drew near, He saw the city and 
LUK.19.42	saying, 
LUK.19.45	Then He went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, 
LUK.19.46	saying to them, 
LUK.19.47	And He 
LUK.19.48	and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to 
LUK.20.1	Now 
LUK.20.2	and spoke to Him, saying, “Tell us, 
LUK.20.3	But He answered and said to them, 
LUK.20.5	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, 
LUK.20.7	So they answered that they did not know where 
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.9	Then He began to tell the people this parable: 
LUK.20.13	“Then the owner of the vineyard said, 
LUK.20.16	And when they heard 
LUK.20.17	Then He looked at them and said, 
LUK.20.19	And the chief priests and the scribes that very hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they feared the people —for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.
LUK.20.20	So they watched 
LUK.20.21	Then they asked Him, saying, 
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
LUK.20.23	But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, 
LUK.20.24	They answered and said, “Caesar’s.”
LUK.20.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.20.26	But they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.
LUK.20.27	Then some of the Sadducees, 
LUK.20.28	saying: “Teacher, Moses wrote to us 
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children. 
LUK.20.30	And the second took her as wife, and he died childless. 
LUK.20.31	Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died. 
LUK.20.32	Last of all the woman died also. 
LUK.20.33	Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her as wife.”
LUK.20.34	Jesus answered and said to them, 
LUK.20.39	Then some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.” 
LUK.20.40	But after that they dared not question Him anymore.
LUK.20.41	And He said to them, 
LUK.20.45	Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to His disciples, 
LUK.21.1	And He looked up 
LUK.21.2	and He saw also a certain 
LUK.21.3	So He said, 
LUK.21.5	Then, as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said, 
LUK.21.7	So they asked Him, saying, “Teacher, but when will these things be? And what sign 
LUK.21.8	And He said: 
LUK.21.10	Then He said to them, 
LUK.21.29	Then He spoke to them a parable: 
LUK.21.37	And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but 
LUK.21.38	Then early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him.
LUK.22.1	Now 
LUK.22.2	And 
LUK.22.3	Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the 
LUK.22.4	So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them. 
LUK.22.5	And they were glad, and 
LUK.22.6	So he promised and sought opportunity to 
LUK.22.7	Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed. 
LUK.22.8	And He sent Peter and John, saying, 
LUK.22.9	So they said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare?”
LUK.22.10	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.13	So they went and 
LUK.22.14	When the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him. 
LUK.22.15	Then He said to them, 
LUK.22.17	Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, 
LUK.22.19	And He took bread, gave thanks and broke 
LUK.22.20	Likewise He also 
LUK.22.23	Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
LUK.22.24	Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest. 
LUK.22.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.31	And the Lord said, 
LUK.22.33	But he said to Him, “Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.”
LUK.22.34	Then He said, 
LUK.22.35	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.35	So they said, “Nothing.”
LUK.22.36	Then He said to them, 
LUK.22.38	So they said, “Lord, look, here 
LUK.22.38	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.39	Coming out, 
LUK.22.40	When He came to the place, He said to them, 
LUK.22.41	And He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	saying, 
LUK.22.43	Then 
LUK.22.44	And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
LUK.22.45	When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow. 
LUK.22.46	Then He said to them, 
LUK.22.47	And while He was still speaking, 
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.22.49	When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” 
LUK.22.50	And 
LUK.22.51	But Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, 
LUK.22.54	Having arrested Him, they led 
LUK.22.55	Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. 
LUK.22.56	And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, “This man was also with Him.”
LUK.22.57	But he denied Him, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”
LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him and said, “You also are of them.”
LUK.22.58	But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”
LUK.22.59	Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Surely this 
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying!”
LUK.22.60	Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then 
LUK.22.62	So Peter went out and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and 
LUK.22.64	And having blindfolded Him, they 
LUK.22.65	And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.
LUK.22.66	As soon as it was day, 
LUK.22.67	“If You are the Christ, tell us.”
LUK.22.67	But He said to them, 
LUK.22.70	Then they all said, “Are You then the Son of God?”
LUK.22.70	So He said to them, 
LUK.22.71	And they said, “What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.”
LUK.23.1	Then 
LUK.23.2	And they began to 
LUK.23.3	Then Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?”
LUK.23.3	He answered him and said, 
LUK.23.4	So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, 
LUK.23.5	But they were the more fierce, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from 
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	And as soon as he knew that He belonged to 
LUK.23.8	Now when Herod saw Jesus, 
LUK.23.9	Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him 
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him. 
LUK.23.11	Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked 
LUK.23.12	That very day 
LUK.23.13	Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 
LUK.23.14	said to them, 
LUK.23.15	no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him. 
LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise Him and release 
LUK.23.17	(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).
LUK.23.18	And 
LUK.23.19	who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.
LUK.23.20	Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. 
LUK.23.21	But they shouted, saying, “Crucify 
LUK.23.22	Then he said to them the third time, “Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let 
LUK.23.23	But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	So 
LUK.23.25	And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear 
LUK.23.27	And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus, turning to them, said, 
LUK.23.32	There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. 
LUK.23.33	And 
LUK.23.34	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.23.34	And 
LUK.23.35	And 
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him 
LUK.23.37	and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.”
LUK.23.38	And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:
LUK.23.38	THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
LUK.23.39	Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, “If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.”
LUK.23.40	But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? 
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done 
LUK.23.42	Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.”
LUK.23.43	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.23.44	Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 
LUK.23.45	Then the sun was darkened, and 
LUK.23.46	And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, 
LUK.23.47	So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous Man!”
LUK.23.48	And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned. 
LUK.23.49	But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
LUK.23.50	Now behold, 
LUK.23.51	He had not consented to their decision and deed. 
LUK.23.52	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb 
LUK.23.54	That day was 
LUK.23.55	And the women 
LUK.23.56	Then they returned and 
LUK.24.1	Now 
LUK.24.2	But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 
LUK.24.3	Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that 
LUK.24.5	Then, as they were afraid and bowed 
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but is risen! 
LUK.24.7	saying, 
LUK.24.8	And 
LUK.24.9	Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Magdalene, 
LUK.24.11	And their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.
LUK.24.13	Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
LUK.24.15	So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that 
LUK.24.16	But 
LUK.24.17	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.18	Then the one 
LUK.24.19	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.19	So they said to Him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, 
LUK.24.20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him. 
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping 
LUK.24.22	Yes, and 
LUK.24.23	When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive. 
LUK.24.24	And 
LUK.24.25	Then He said to them, 
LUK.24.27	And beginning at 
LUK.24.28	Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and 
LUK.24.29	But 
LUK.24.30	Now it came to pass, as 
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.
LUK.24.32	And they said to one another, “Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?” 
LUK.24.33	So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those 
LUK.24.34	saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and 
LUK.24.35	And they told about the things 
LUK.24.36	Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, 
LUK.24.37	But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they had seen 
LUK.24.38	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.40	When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 
LUK.24.41	But while they still did not believe 
LUK.24.42	So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. 
LUK.24.43	And He took 
LUK.24.44	Then He said to them, 
LUK.24.45	And 
LUK.24.46	Then He said to them, 
LUK.24.50	And He led them out 
LUK.24.51	Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 
LUK.24.53	and were continually 
JHN.1.1	In the beginning 
JHN.1.2	He was in the beginning with God. 
JHN.1.3	All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 
JHN.1.4	In Him was life, and 
JHN.1.5	And 
JHN.1.6	There was a 
JHN.1.7	This man came for a 
JHN.1.8	He was not that Light, but 
JHN.1.9	That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and 
JHN.1.11	He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 
JHN.1.12	But 
JHN.1.13	who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
JHN.1.14	And the Word 
JHN.1.15	John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, 
JHN.1.16	And of His 
JHN.1.17	For 
JHN.1.18	No one has seen God at any time. 
JHN.1.19	Now this is 
JHN.1.20	He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”
JHN.1.21	And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”
JHN.1.21	He said, “I am not.”
JHN.1.21	“Are you 
JHN.1.21	And he answered, “No.”
JHN.1.22	Then they said to him, “Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”
JHN.1.23	He said: 
JHN.1.23	‘The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
JHN.1.23	“Make straight the way of the 
JHN.1.23	as the prophet Isaiah said.”
JHN.1.24	Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	And they asked him, saying, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
JHN.1.26	John answered them, saying, 
JHN.1.27	It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.”
JHN.1.28	These things were done 
JHN.1.29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold! 
JHN.1.30	This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, 
JHN.1.32	And John bore witness, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him. 
JHN.1.33	I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, 
JHN.1.34	And I have seen and testified that this is the 
JHN.1.35	Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. 
JHN.1.36	And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, 
JHN.1.37	The two disciples heard him speak, and they 
JHN.1.38	Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, 
JHN.1.38	They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), “where are You staying?”
JHN.1.39	He said to them, 
JHN.1.40	One of the two who heard John 
JHN.1.41	He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated, the Christ). 
JHN.1.42	And he brought him to Jesus.
JHN.1.42	Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, 
JHN.1.43	The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found 
JHN.1.44	Now 
JHN.1.45	Philip found 
JHN.1.46	And Nathanael said to him, 
JHN.1.46	Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?”
JHN.1.48	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered and said to Him, “Rabbi, 
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.1.51	And He said to him, 
JHN.2.1	On the third day there was a 
JHN.2.2	Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. 
JHN.2.3	And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”
JHN.2.4	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do 
JHN.2.6	Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, 
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.2.8	And He said to them, 
JHN.2.9	When the master of the feast had tasted 
JHN.2.10	And he said to him, “Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the 
JHN.2.11	This 
JHN.2.12	After this He went down to 
JHN.2.13	Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business. 
JHN.2.15	When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables. 
JHN.2.16	And He said to those who sold doves, 
JHN.2.17	Then His disciples remembered that it was written, 
JHN.2.18	So the Jews answered and said to Him, 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.2.20	Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”
JHN.2.21	But He was speaking 
JHN.2.22	Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, 
JHN.2.23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He 
JHN.2.25	and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for 
JHN.3.1	There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 
JHN.3.2	This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for 
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus answered and said to Him, 
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.3.22	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them 
JHN.3.23	Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near 
JHN.3.24	For 
JHN.3.25	Then there arose a dispute between 
JHN.3.26	And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, 
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 
JHN.3.29	He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but 
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I 
JHN.3.31	He who comes from above 
JHN.3.32	And 
JHN.3.33	He who has received His testimony 
JHN.3.34	For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand. 
JHN.3.36	He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the 
JHN.4.1	Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and 
JHN.4.2	(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), 
JHN.4.3	He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	But He needed to go through Samaria.
JHN.4.5	So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that 
JHN.4.6	Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from 
JHN.4.7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.8	For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
JHN.4.9	Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For 
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said to her, 
JHN.4.11	The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? 
JHN.4.12	Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?”
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said to her, 
JHN.4.15	The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”
JHN.4.16	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.”
JHN.4.17	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.19	The woman said to Him, “Sir, 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshiped on 
JHN.4.21	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.25	The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah 
JHN.4.26	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.27	And at this 
JHN.4.28	The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men, 
JHN.4.29	“Come, see a Man 
JHN.4.30	Then they went out of the city and came to Him.
JHN.4.31	In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
JHN.4.32	But He said to them, 
JHN.4.33	Therefore the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him 
JHN.4.34	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.4.39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. 
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of His own 
JHN.4.42	Then they said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of what you said, for 
JHN.4.43	Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	For 
JHN.4.45	So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, 
JHN.4.46	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 
JHN.4.48	Then Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.49	The nobleman said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”
JHN.4.50	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.51	And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told 
JHN.4.52	Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” 
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that 
JHN.4.54	This again 
JHN.5.1	After 
JHN.5.2	Now there is in Jerusalem 
JHN.5.3	In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. 
JHN.5.4	For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. 
JHN.5.5	Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been 
JHN.5.7	The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”
JHN.5.8	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked.
JHN.5.9	And 
JHN.5.10	The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath; 
JHN.5.11	He answered them, “He who made me well said to me, 
JHN.5.12	Then they asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, 
JHN.5.13	But the one who was 
JHN.5.14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, 
JHN.5.15	The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
JHN.5.16	For this reason the Jews 
JHN.5.17	But Jesus answered them, 
JHN.5.18	Therefore the Jews 
JHN.5.19	Then Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.6.1	After 
JHN.6.2	Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were 
JHN.6.3	And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.
JHN.6.4	Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. 
JHN.6.5	Then Jesus lifted up 
JHN.6.6	But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.
JHN.6.7	Philip answered Him, 
JHN.6.8	One of His disciples, 
JHN.6.9	“There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, 
JHN.6.10	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.6.11	And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed 
JHN.6.12	So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, 
JHN.6.13	Therefore they gathered 
JHN.6.14	Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, “This is truly 
JHN.6.15	Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him 
JHN.6.16	Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, 
JHN.6.17	got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. 
JHN.6.18	Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing. 
JHN.6.19	So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were 
JHN.6.20	But He said to them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
JHN.6.22	On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone— 
JHN.6.23	however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks— 
JHN.6.24	when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, 
JHN.6.25	And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them and said, 
JHN.6.28	Then they said to Him, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.6.30	Therefore they said to Him, 
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, 
JHN.6.32	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.34	Then they said to Him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”
JHN.6.35	And Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.41	The Jews then complained about Him, because He said, 
JHN.6.42	And they said, 
JHN.6.43	Jesus therefore answered and said to them, 
JHN.6.52	The Jews therefore 
JHN.6.53	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.59	These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard 
JHN.6.61	When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about this, He said to them, 
JHN.6.64	 For 
JHN.6.65	And He said, 
JHN.6.66	From that 
JHN.6.67	Then Jesus said to the twelve, 
JHN.6.68	But Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have 
JHN.6.69	Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.6.71	He spoke of 
JHN.7.1	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea, 
JHN.7.2	Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was at hand. 
JHN.7.3	His brothers therefore said to Him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing. 
JHN.7.4	For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.” 
JHN.7.5	For 
JHN.7.6	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.7.9	When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
JHN.7.11	Then 
JHN.7.12	And 
JHN.7.13	However, no one spoke openly of Him 
JHN.7.14	Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and 
JHN.7.15	And the Jews marveled, saying, “How does this Man know letters, having never studied?”
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered them and said, 
JHN.7.20	The people answered and said, 
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.7.25	Now some of them from Jerusalem said, “Is this not He whom they seek to 
JHN.7.26	But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. 
JHN.7.27	However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.”
JHN.7.28	Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, 
JHN.7.30	Therefore 
JHN.7.31	And 
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him. 
JHN.7.33	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.7.35	Then the Jews said among themselves, “Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to 
JHN.7.36	What is this thing that He said, 
JHN.7.37	On the last day, that great 
JHN.7.39	But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet 
JHN.7.40	Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, “Truly this is 
JHN.7.41	Others said, “This is 
JHN.7.41	But some said, “Will the Christ come out of Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, 
JHN.7.43	So 
JHN.7.44	Now 
JHN.7.45	Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why have you not brought Him?”
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, 
JHN.7.47	Then the Pharisees answered them, “Are you also deceived? 
JHN.7.48	Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him? 
JHN.7.49	But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.”
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus 
JHN.7.51	“Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?”
JHN.7.52	They answered and said to him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for 
JHN.7.53	And everyone went to his 
JHN.8.1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
JHN.8.2	Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and 
JHN.8.3	Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, 
JHN.8.4	they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in 
JHN.8.5	Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” 
JHN.8.6	This they said, testing Him, that they 
JHN.8.7	So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, 
JHN.8.8	And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	Then those who heard 
JHN.8.10	When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, 
JHN.8.11	She said, “No one, Lord.”
JHN.8.11	And Jesus said to her, 
JHN.8.12	Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees therefore said to Him, 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.8.19	Then they said to Him, “Where is Your Father?”
JHN.8.19	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	These words Jesus spoke in 
JHN.8.21	Then Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.8.22	So the Jews said, “Will He kill Himself, because He says, 
JHN.8.23	And He said to them, 
JHN.8.25	Then they said to Him, “Who are You?”
JHN.8.25	And Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.27	They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.
JHN.8.28	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.30	As He spoke these words, 
JHN.8.31	Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, 
JHN.8.33	They answered Him, 
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.8.39	They answered and said to Him, 
JHN.8.39	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.41	Then they said to Him, “We were not born of fornication; 
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.48	Then the Jews answered and said to Him, “Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and 
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.52	Then the Jews said to Him, “Now we know that You 
JHN.8.53	Are You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. 
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.57	Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?”
JHN.8.58	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.59	Then 
JHN.9.1	Now as 
JHN.9.2	And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, 
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.6	When He had said these things, 
JHN.9.7	And He said to him, 
JHN.9.8	Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was blind said, “Is not this he who sat and begged?”
JHN.9.9	Some said, “This is he.” Others 
JHN.9.9	He said, “I am 
JHN.9.10	Therefore they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?”
JHN.9.11	He answered and said, 
JHN.9.12	Then they said to him, “Where is He?”
JHN.9.12	He said, “I do not know.”
JHN.9.13	They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. 
JHN.9.14	Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. 
JHN.9.15	Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”
JHN.9.16	Therefore some of the Pharisees said, “This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.”
JHN.9.16	Others said, 
JHN.9.17	They said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?”
JHN.9.17	He said, 
JHN.9.18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight. 
JHN.9.19	And they asked them, saying, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
JHN.9.20	His parents answered them and said, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
JHN.9.21	but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said these 
JHN.9.23	Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, 
JHN.9.25	He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner 
JHN.9.26	Then they said to him again, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”
JHN.9.27	He answered them, “I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear 
JHN.9.28	Then they reviled him and said, “You are His disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples. 
JHN.9.29	We know that God 
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said to them, 
JHN.9.31	Now we know that 
JHN.9.32	Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.”
JHN.9.34	They answered and said to him, 
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had 
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?”
JHN.9.37	And Jesus said to him, 
JHN.9.38	Then he said, “Lord, I believe!” And he 
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	Then 
JHN.9.41	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.10.6	Jesus used this illustration, but they did not understand the things which He spoke to them.
JHN.10.7	Then Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.10.19	Therefore 
JHN.10.20	And many of them said, 
JHN.10.21	Others said, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. 
JHN.10.22	Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. 
JHN.10.23	And Jesus walked in the temple, 
JHN.10.24	Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, “How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.31	Then 
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered Him, saying, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for 
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.39	Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand.
JHN.10.40	And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place 
JHN.10.41	Then many came to Him and said, “John performed no sign, 
JHN.10.42	And many believed in Him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a certain 
JHN.11.2	It was 
JHN.11.3	Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.”
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	So, when He heard that he was sick, 
JHN.11.7	Then after this He said to 
JHN.11.8	 disciples said to Him, “Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to 
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.11.11	These things He said, and after that He said to them, 
JHN.11.12	Then His disciples said, “Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.” 
JHN.11.13	However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.
JHN.11.14	Then Jesus said to them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Then 
JHN.11.17	So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. 
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away. 
JHN.11.19	And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
JHN.11.20	Now Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house. 
JHN.11.21	Now Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	But even now I know that 
JHN.11.23	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.24	Martha said to Him, 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.27	She said to Him, “Yes, Lord, 
JHN.11.28	And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, “The Teacher has come and is calling for you.” 
JHN.11.29	As soon as she heard 
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him. 
JHN.11.31	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”
JHN.11.32	Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she 
JHN.11.33	Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. 
JHN.11.34	And He said, 
JHN.11.34	They said to Him, “Lord, come and see.”
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”
JHN.11.37	And some of them said, “Could not this Man, 
JHN.11.38	Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a 
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.11.39	Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been 
JHN.11.40	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.41	Then they took away the stone 
JHN.11.43	Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with 
JHN.11.45	Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went away to the Pharisees and 
JHN.11.47	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, 
JHN.11.48	If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.”
JHN.11.49	And one of them, 
JHN.11.50	nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.” 
JHN.11.51	Now this he did not say on his own 
JHN.11.52	and 
JHN.11.53	Then, from that day on, they plotted to 
JHN.11.54	Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called 
JHN.11.55	And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to 
JHN.11.56	Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, “What do you think—that He will not come to the feast?” 
JHN.11.57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report 
JHN.12.1	Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, 
JHN.12.2	There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. 
JHN.12.3	Then 
JHN.12.4	But one of His disciples, 
JHN.12.5	“Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” 
JHN.12.6	This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and 
JHN.12.7	But Jesus said, 
JHN.12.9	Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, 
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also, 
JHN.12.11	because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
JHN.12.12	The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
JHN.12.13	took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out:
JHN.12.13	“Hosanna!
JHN.12.13	‘Blessed 
JHN.12.13	The King of Israel!”
JHN.12.14	Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:
JHN.12.15	“Fear
JHN.12.15	Behold, your King is coming,
JHN.12.15	Sitting on a donkey’s colt.”
JHN.12.16	His disciples did not understand these things at first; 
JHN.12.17	Therefore the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness. 
JHN.12.18	For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign. 
JHN.12.19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, 
JHN.12.20	Now there 
JHN.12.21	Then they came to Philip, 
JHN.12.22	Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
JHN.12.23	But Jesus answered them, saying, 
JHN.12.28	Then a voice came from heaven, 
JHN.12.29	Therefore the people who stood by and heard 
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, 
JHN.12.33	This He said, signifying by what death He would die.
JHN.12.34	The people answered Him, 
JHN.12.35	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.12.36	 These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and 
JHN.12.37	But although He had done so many 
JHN.12.38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:
JHN.12.38	“Lord, who has believed our report?
JHN.12.38	And to whom has the arm of the 
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
JHN.12.40	“He
JHN.12.40	Lest they should see with 
JHN.12.40	Lest they should understand with 
JHN.12.40	So that I should heal them.”
JHN.12.41	These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
JHN.12.44	Then Jesus cried out and said, 
JHN.13.1	Now 
JHN.13.2	And supper being ended, 
JHN.13.3	Jesus, knowing 
JHN.13.4	rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. 
JHN.13.5	After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe 
JHN.13.6	Then He came to Simon Peter. And 
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.13.8	Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!”
JHN.13.8	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also 
JHN.13.10	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.13.11	For 
JHN.13.12	So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, 
JHN.13.21	When Jesus had said these things, 
JHN.13.22	Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.
JHN.13.23	Now 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.
JHN.13.25	Then, leaning back on Jesus’ breast, he said to Him, “Lord, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.27	Now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, 
JHN.13.28	But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him. 
JHN.13.29	For some thought, because 
JHN.13.30	Having received the piece of bread, he then went out immediately. And it was night.
JHN.13.31	So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?”
JHN.13.36	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.13.37	Peter said to Him, “Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will 
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?”
JHN.14.6	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.14.8	Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”
JHN.14.9	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.14.22	Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, “Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?”
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.16.17	Then 
JHN.16.18	They said therefore, “What is this that He says, 
JHN.16.19	Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, 
JHN.16.29	His disciples said to Him, “See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech! 
JHN.16.30	Now we are sure that 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.17.1	Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: 
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had spoken these words, 
JHN.18.2	And Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place; 
JHN.18.3	Then Judas, having received a detachment 
JHN.18.4	Jesus therefore, 
JHN.18.5	They answered Him, 
JHN.18.5	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.18.6	Now when He said to them, 
JHN.18.7	Then He asked them again, 
JHN.18.7	And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.9	that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
JHN.18.11	So Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.18.12	Then the detachment 
JHN.18.13	And 
JHN.18.14	Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
JHN.18.15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so 
JHN.18.16	But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in. 
JHN.18.17	Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, “You are not also 
JHN.18.17	He said, “I am 
JHN.18.18	Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.
JHN.18.19	The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.22	And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by 
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent Him bound to 
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. 
JHN.18.25	He denied 
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the high priest, a relative 
JHN.18.27	Peter then denied again; and 
JHN.18.28	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. 
JHN.18.29	Pilate then went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?”
JHN.18.30	They answered and said to him, “If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.”
JHN.18.31	Then Pilate said to them, “You take Him and judge Him according to your law.”
JHN.18.31	Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,” 
JHN.18.32	that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, 
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?”
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.37	Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?”
JHN.18.37	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.38	Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, 
JHN.18.39	“But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
JHN.18.40	Then they all cried again, saying, “Not this Man, but Barabbas!” 
JHN.19.1	So then 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put 
JHN.19.3	Then they said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they 
JHN.19.4	Pilate then went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, 
JHN.19.5	Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And 
JHN.19.6	Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify 
JHN.19.6	Pilate said to them, “You take Him and crucify 
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, 
JHN.19.8	Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, 
JHN.19.9	and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, “Where are You from?” 
JHN.19.10	Then Pilate said to Him, “Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?”
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar’s friend. 
JHN.19.13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called 
JHN.19.14	Now 
JHN.19.15	But they cried out, “Away with 
JHN.19.15	Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”
JHN.19.15	The chief priests answered, 
JHN.19.16	Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led 
JHN.19.17	And He, bearing His cross, 
JHN.19.18	where they crucified Him, and 
JHN.19.19	Now Pilate wrote a title and put 
JHN.19.19	JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
JHN.19.20	Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, 
JHN.19.21	Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, “I am the King of the Jews.” ’ ”
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. 
JHN.19.24	They said therefore among themselves, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says:
JHN.19.24	“They divided My garments among them,
JHN.19.24	And for My clothing they cast lots.”
JHN.19.24	Therefore the soldiers did these things.
JHN.19.25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the 
JHN.19.26	When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and 
JHN.19.27	Then He said to the disciple, 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, 
JHN.19.29	Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and 
JHN.19.30	So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 
JHN.19.31	Therefore, because it was the Preparation 
JHN.19.32	Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. 
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately 
JHN.19.35	And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is 
JHN.19.36	For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, 
JHN.19.37	And again another Scripture says, 
JHN.19.38	After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, 
JHN.19.39	And 
JHN.19.40	Then they took the body of Jesus, and 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 
JHN.19.42	So 
JHN.20.1	Now on the 
JHN.20.2	Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the 
JHN.20.3	Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	And he, stooping down and looking in, saw 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying 
JHN.20.7	and 
JHN.20.8	Then the 
JHN.20.9	For as yet they did not know the 
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down 
JHN.20.12	And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
JHN.20.13	Then they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”
JHN.20.13	She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.”
JHN.20.14	Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing 
JHN.20.15	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.15	She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, “Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.”
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.16	She turned and said to Him, “Rabboni!” (which is to say, Teacher).
JHN.20.17	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and 
JHN.20.19	Then, the same day at evening, being the first 
JHN.20.20	When He had said this, He 
JHN.20.21	So Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.20.22	And when He had said this, He breathed on 
JHN.20.24	Now Thomas, 
JHN.20.25	The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord.”
JHN.20.25	So he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”
JHN.20.26	And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, 
JHN.20.27	Then He said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”
JHN.20.29	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.20.30	And 
JHN.20.31	but these are written that 
JHN.21.1	After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the 
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.”
JHN.21.3	They said to him, “We are going with you also.” They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing. 
JHN.21.4	But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples 
JHN.21.5	Then 
JHN.21.5	They answered Him, “No.”
JHN.21.6	And He said to them, 
JHN.21.7	Therefore 
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish. 
JHN.21.9	Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. 
JHN.21.10	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken. 
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.13	Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.
JHN.21.14	This 
JHN.21.15	So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.15	He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”
JHN.21.15	He said to him, 
JHN.21.16	He said to him again a second time, 
JHN.21.16	He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”
JHN.21.16	He said to him, 
JHN.21.17	He said to him the third time, 
JHN.21.17	And he said to Him, “Lord, 
JHN.21.17	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.21.19	This He spoke, signifying 
JHN.21.20	Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple 
JHN.21.21	Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “But Lord, what 
JHN.21.22	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.21.23	Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who 
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, 
ACT.1.1	The former account I made, O 
ACT.1.2	until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit 
ACT.1.3	to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
ACT.1.4	And being assembled together with 
ACT.1.6	Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” 
ACT.1.7	And He said to them, 
ACT.1.9	Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, 
ACT.1.10	And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them 
ACT.1.11	who also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This 
ACT.1.12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey. 
ACT.1.13	And when they had entered, they went up 
ACT.1.14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with 
ACT.1.15	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number 
ACT.1.16	“Men 
ACT.1.17	for 
ACT.1.18	(Now this man purchased a field with 
ACT.1.19	And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT.1.20	“For it is written in the Book of Psalms:
ACT.1.20	‘Let his dwelling place be desolate,
ACT.1.20	And let no one live in it’;
ACT.1.20	and,
ACT.1.20	‘Let another take his office.’
ACT.1.21	“Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
ACT.1.22	beginning from the baptism of John to that day when 
ACT.1.23	And they proposed two: Joseph called 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed and said, “You, O Lord, 
ACT.1.25	to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.” 
ACT.1.26	And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	When 
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it 
ACT.2.3	Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and 
ACT.2.4	And 
ACT.2.5	And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, 
ACT.2.6	And when this sound occurred, the 
ACT.2.7	Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Look, are not all these who speak 
ACT.2.8	And how 
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.” 
ACT.2.12	So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “Whatever could this mean?”
ACT.2.13	Others mocking said, “They are full of new wine.”
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. 
ACT.2.15	For these are not drunk, as you suppose, 
ACT.2.16	But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	‘And
ACT.2.17	That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;
ACT.2.17	Your sons and 
ACT.2.17	Your young men shall see visions,
ACT.2.17	Your old men shall dream dreams.
ACT.2.18	And on My menservants and on My maidservants
ACT.2.18	I will pour out My Spirit in those days;
ACT.2.18	And they shall prophesy.
ACT.2.19	I will show wonders in heaven above
ACT.2.19	And signs in the earth beneath:
ACT.2.19	Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
ACT.2.20	The sun shall be turned into darkness,
ACT.2.20	And the moon into blood,
ACT.2.20	Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the 
ACT.2.21	And it shall come to pass
ACT.2.21	Shall be saved.’
ACT.2.22	“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you 
ACT.2.23	Him, 
ACT.2.24	whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it. 
ACT.2.25	For David says concerning Him:
ACT.2.25	‘I foresaw the 
ACT.2.25	For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.
ACT.2.26	Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;
ACT.2.26	Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.
ACT.2.27	For You will not leave my soul in Hades,
ACT.2.27	Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see 
ACT.2.28	You have made known to me the ways of life;
ACT.2.28	You will make me full of joy in Your presence.’
ACT.2.29	“Men 
ACT.2.30	Therefore, being a prophet, 
ACT.2.31	he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, 
ACT.2.32	This Jesus God has raised up, 
ACT.2.33	Therefore 
ACT.2.34	“For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:
ACT.2.34	‘The 
ACT.2.34	“Sit at My right hand,
ACT.2.35	Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.” ’
ACT.2.36	“Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard 
ACT.2.38	Then Peter said to them, 
ACT.2.39	For the promise is to you and 
ACT.2.40	And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.” 
ACT.2.41	Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added 
ACT.2.42	And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. 
ACT.2.43	Then fear came upon every soul, and 
ACT.2.44	Now all who believed were together, and 
ACT.2.45	and sold their possessions and goods, and 
ACT.2.46	So continuing daily with one accord 
ACT.2.47	praising God and having favor with all the people. And 
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John went up together 
ACT.3.2	And 
ACT.3.3	who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. 
ACT.3.4	And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, “Look at us.” 
ACT.3.5	So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. 
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: 
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand and lifted 
ACT.3.8	So he, 
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God. 
ACT.3.10	Then they knew that it was he who 
ACT.3.11	Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch 
ACT.3.12	So when Peter saw 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, 
ACT.3.14	But you denied 
ACT.3.15	and killed the Prince of life, 
ACT.3.16	And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which 
ACT.3.17	“Yet now, brethren, I know that 
ACT.3.18	But 
ACT.3.19	Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, 
ACT.3.20	and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before, 
ACT.3.21	whom heaven must receive until the times of 
ACT.3.22	For Moses truly said to the fathers, 
ACT.3.23	And it shall be 
ACT.3.24	Yes, and 
ACT.3.25	You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 
ACT.3.26	To you 
ACT.4.1	Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the 
ACT.4.2	being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them, and put 
ACT.4.4	However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, 
ACT.4.6	as well as 
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: 
ACT.4.9	If we this day are judged for a good deed 
ACT.4.10	let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, 
ACT.4.11	This is the 
ACT.4.12	Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, 
ACT.4.14	And seeing the man who had been healed 
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
ACT.4.16	saying, 
ACT.4.17	But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this name.”
ACT.4.18	So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered and said to them, 
ACT.4.20	For we cannot but speak the things which 
ACT.4.21	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, 
ACT.4.22	For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
ACT.4.23	And being let go, 
ACT.4.24	So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: “Lord, 
ACT.4.25	who by the mouth of Your servant David have said:
ACT.4.25	‘Why did the nations rage,
ACT.4.25	And the people plot vain things?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth took their stand,
ACT.4.26	And the rulers were gathered together
ACT.4.26	Against the 
ACT.4.27	“For 
ACT.4.28	to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done. 
ACT.4.29	Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants 
ACT.4.30	by stretching out Your hand to heal, 
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, 
ACT.4.32	Now the multitude of those who believed 
ACT.4.33	And with 
ACT.4.34	Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; 
ACT.4.35	and laid 
ACT.4.36	And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus, 
ACT.4.37	having land, sold 
ACT.5.1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession. 
ACT.5.2	And he kept back 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, “Ananias, why has 
ACT.5.4	While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.”
ACT.5.5	Then Ananias, hearing these words, 
ACT.5.6	And the young men arose and 
ACT.5.7	Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	And Peter answered her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?”
ACT.5.8	She said, “Yes, for so much.”
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together 
ACT.5.10	Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying 
ACT.5.11	So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.
ACT.5.12	And 
ACT.5.13	Yet 
ACT.5.14	And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, 
ACT.5.15	so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid 
ACT.5.16	Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing 
ACT.5.17	Then the high priest rose up, and all those who 
ACT.5.18	and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 
ACT.5.19	But at night 
ACT.5.20	“Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people 
ACT.5.21	And when they heard 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, 
ACT.5.23	saying, “Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!” 
ACT.5.24	Now when the high priest, 
ACT.5.25	So one came and told them, saying, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”
ACT.5.26	Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, 
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set 
ACT.5.28	saying, 
ACT.5.29	But Peter and the 
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by 
ACT.5.31	Him God has exalted to His right hand 
ACT.5.32	And 
ACT.5.33	When they heard 
ACT.5.34	Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named 
ACT.5.35	And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. 
ACT.5.36	For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. 
ACT.5.38	And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; 
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found 
ACT.5.40	And they agreed with him, and when they had 
ACT.5.41	So they departed from the presence of the council, 
ACT.5.42	And daily 
ACT.6.1	Now in those days, 
ACT.6.2	Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, 
ACT.6.3	Therefore, brethren, 
ACT.6.4	but we 
ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, 
ACT.6.6	whom they set before the apostles; and 
ACT.6.7	Then 
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great 
ACT.6.9	Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen. 
ACT.6.10	And 
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” 
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon 
ACT.6.13	They also set up false witnesses who said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law; 
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.” 
ACT.6.15	And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then the high priest said, “Are these things so?”
ACT.7.2	And he said, 
ACT.7.3	and said to him, 
ACT.7.4	Then 
ACT.7.5	And 
ACT.7.6	But God spoke in this way: 
ACT.7.7	‘And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will 
ACT.7.8	Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision; 
ACT.7.9	“And the patriarchs, becoming envious, 
ACT.7.10	and delivered him out of all his troubles, 
ACT.7.11	Now a famine and great trouble came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no sustenance. 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. 
ACT.7.13	And the 
ACT.7.14	Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and 
ACT.7.15	So Jacob went down to Egypt; 
ACT.7.16	And 
ACT.7.17	“But when 
ACT.7.18	till another king 
ACT.7.19	This man dealt treacherously with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, 
ACT.7.20	At this time Moses was born, and 
ACT.7.21	But 
ACT.7.22	And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was 
ACT.7.23	“Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. 
ACT.7.24	And seeing one of 
ACT.7.25	For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not understand. 
ACT.7.26	And the next day he appeared to 
ACT.7.27	But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, 
ACT.7.28	Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?’ 
ACT.7.29	Then, at this saying, Moses fled and became a dweller in the land of Midian, where he 
ACT.7.30	“And when forty years had passed, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai. 
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw 
ACT.7.33	‘Then the 
ACT.7.34	I have surely 
ACT.7.35	“This Moses whom they rejected, saying, 
ACT.7.36	He brought them out, after he had 
ACT.7.37	“This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, 
ACT.7.38	“This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with 
ACT.7.39	whom our fathers 
ACT.7.40	saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods to go before us; 
ACT.7.41	And they made a calf in those days, offered sacrifices to the idol, and 
ACT.7.42	Then 
ACT.7.42	‘Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices 
ACT.7.42	O house of Israel?
ACT.7.43	You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch,
ACT.7.43	And the star of your god Remphan,
ACT.7.43	Images which you made to worship;
ACT.7.43	And 
ACT.7.44	“Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Moses 
ACT.7.45	which our fathers, having received it in turn, also brought with Joshua into the land possessed by the Gentiles, 
ACT.7.46	who found favor before God and 
ACT.7.47	But Solomon built Him a house.
ACT.7.48	“However, 
ACT.7.49	‘Heaven
ACT.7.49	And earth 
ACT.7.49	What house will you build for Me? says the 
ACT.7.49	Or what 
ACT.7.50	Has My hand not 
ACT.7.51	“
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of 
ACT.7.53	who have received the law by the direction of angels and have not kept 
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with 
ACT.7.55	But he, 
ACT.7.56	and said, “Look! 
ACT.7.57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord; 
ACT.7.58	and they cast 
ACT.7.59	And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on 
ACT.7.60	Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, 
ACT.8.1	Now Saul was consenting to his death.
ACT.8.1	At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and 
ACT.8.2	And devout men carried Stephen 
ACT.8.3	As for Saul, 
ACT.8.4	Therefore 
ACT.8.5	Then 
ACT.8.6	And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
ACT.8.7	For 
ACT.8.8	And there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously 
ACT.8.10	to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the great power of God.” 
ACT.8.11	And they heeded him because he had astonished them with his sorceries for a long time. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip as he preached the things 
ACT.8.13	Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which were done.
ACT.8.14	Now when the 
ACT.8.15	who, when they had come down, prayed for them 
ACT.8.16	For 
ACT.8.17	Then 
ACT.8.18	And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give me this power also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.8.20	But Peter said to him, “Your money perish with you, because 
ACT.8.21	You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your 
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God 
ACT.8.23	For I see that you are 
ACT.8.24	Then Simon answered and said, 
ACT.8.25	So when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	Now an angel of the Lord spoke to 
ACT.8.27	So he arose and went. And behold, 
ACT.8.28	was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet. 
ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and overtake this chariot.”
ACT.8.30	So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
ACT.8.31	And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	The place in the Scripture which he read was this:
ACT.8.32	“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
ACT.8.32	And as a lamb before its shearer 
ACT.8.32	So He opened not His mouth.
ACT.8.33	In His humiliation His 
ACT.8.33	And who will declare His generation?
ACT.8.33	For His life is 
ACT.8.34	So the eunuch answered Philip and said, “I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?” 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, 
ACT.8.36	Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “See, 
ACT.8.37	Then Philip said, 
ACT.8.37	And he answered and said, 
ACT.8.38	So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	Now when they came up out of the water, 
ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to 
ACT.9.1	Then 
ACT.9.2	and asked 
ACT.9.3	As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. 
ACT.9.4	Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, 
ACT.9.5	And he said, “Who are You, Lord?”
ACT.9.5	Then the Lord said, 
ACT.9.6	So he, trembling and astonished, said, “Lord, what do You want me to do?”
ACT.9.6	Then the Lord 
ACT.9.7	And 
ACT.9.8	Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought 
ACT.9.9	And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
ACT.9.10	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus 
ACT.9.10	And he said, “Here I am, Lord.”
ACT.9.11	So the Lord 
ACT.9.13	Then Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, 
ACT.9.14	And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, 
ACT.9.17	And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and 
ACT.9.18	Immediately there fell from his eyes 
ACT.9.19	So when he had received food, he was strengthened. 
ACT.9.20	Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.
ACT.9.21	Then all who heard were amazed, and said, 
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased all the more in strength, 
ACT.9.23	Now after many days were past, 
ACT.9.24	But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him. 
ACT.9.25	Then the disciples took him by night and 
ACT.9.26	And 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him and brought 
ACT.9.28	So 
ACT.9.29	And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the 
ACT.9.30	When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were 
ACT.9.32	Now it came to pass, as Peter went 
ACT.9.33	There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed. 
ACT.9.34	And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, 
ACT.9.35	So all who dwelt at Lydda and 
ACT.9.36	At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full 
ACT.9.37	But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid 
ACT.9.38	And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring 
ACT.9.39	Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought 
ACT.9.40	But Peter 
ACT.9.41	Then he gave her 
ACT.9.42	And it became known throughout all Joppa, 
ACT.9.43	So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with 
ACT.10.1	There was a certain man in 
ACT.10.2	a devout 
ACT.10.3	About the ninth hour of the day 
ACT.10.4	And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, “What is it, lord?”
ACT.10.4	So he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. 
ACT.10.5	Now 
ACT.10.6	He is lodging with 
ACT.10.7	And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. 
ACT.10.8	So when he had explained all 
ACT.10.9	The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, 
ACT.10.10	Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance 
ACT.10.11	and 
ACT.10.12	In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 
ACT.10.13	And a voice came to him, 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “Not so, Lord! 
ACT.10.15	And a voice 
ACT.10.16	This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate. 
ACT.10.18	And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.
ACT.10.19	While Peter thought about the vision, 
ACT.10.20	Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.”
ACT.10.21	Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, “Yes, I am he whom you seek. For what reason have you come?”
ACT.10.22	And they said, “Cornelius 
ACT.10.23	Then he invited them in and lodged 
ACT.10.23	On the next day Peter went away with them, 
ACT.10.24	And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped 
ACT.10.26	But Peter lifted him up, saying, 
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together. 
ACT.10.28	Then he said to them, “You know how 
ACT.10.29	Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?”
ACT.10.30	So Cornelius said, “Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, 
ACT.10.31	and said, ‘Cornelius, 
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.”
ACT.10.34	Then Peter opened 
ACT.10.35	But 
ACT.10.36	The word which 
ACT.10.37	that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and 
ACT.10.38	how 
ACT.10.39	And we are 
ACT.10.40	Him 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, 
ACT.10.42	And 
ACT.10.43	To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, 
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking these words, 
ACT.10.45	And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.
ACT.10.46	Then Peter answered, 
ACT.10.47	“Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit 
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized 
ACT.11.1	Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, 
ACT.11.3	saying, 
ACT.11.4	But Peter explained 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. 
ACT.11.6	When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice saying to me, 
ACT.11.8	But I said, ‘Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.’ 
ACT.11.9	But the voice answered me again from heaven, 
ACT.11.10	Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 
ACT.11.12	Then 
ACT.11.13	And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, 
ACT.11.14	who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.’ 
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, 
ACT.11.16	Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 
ACT.11.17	If therefore God gave them the same gift as 
ACT.11.18	When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, 
ACT.11.19	Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only. 
ACT.11.20	But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to 
ACT.11.21	And 
ACT.11.22	Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out 
ACT.11.23	When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and 
ACT.11.24	For he was a good man, 
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas departed for 
ACT.11.26	And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
ACT.11.27	And in these days 
ACT.11.28	Then one of them, named 
ACT.11.29	Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send 
ACT.11.30	This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now about that time Herod the king stretched out 
ACT.12.2	Then he killed James 
ACT.12.3	And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. Now it was 
ACT.12.4	So 
ACT.12.5	Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church. 
ACT.12.6	And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. 
ACT.12.7	Now behold, 
ACT.12.8	Then the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and tie on your sandals”; and so he did. And he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	So he went out and followed him, and 
ACT.12.10	When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, 
ACT.12.11	And when Peter had come to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain that 
ACT.12.12	So, when he had considered 
ACT.12.13	And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	When she recognized Peter’s voice, because of 
ACT.12.15	But they said to her, “You are beside yourself!” Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, 
ACT.12.16	Now Peter continued knocking; and when they opened 
ACT.12.17	But 
ACT.12.18	Then, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	But when Herod had searched for him and not found him, he examined the guards and commanded that 
ACT.12.19	And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed 
ACT.12.20	Now Herod had been very angry with the people of 
ACT.12.21	So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne and gave an oration to them. 
ACT.12.22	And the people kept shouting, “The voice of a god and not of a man!” 
ACT.12.23	Then immediately an angel of the Lord 
ACT.12.24	But 
ACT.12.25	And 
ACT.13.1	Now 
ACT.13.2	As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, 
ACT.13.3	Then, 
ACT.13.4	So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to 
ACT.13.5	And when they arrived in Salamis, 
ACT.13.6	Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found 
ACT.13.7	who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But 
ACT.13.9	Then Saul, who also 
ACT.13.10	and said, “O full of all deceit and all fraud, 
ACT.13.11	And now, indeed, 
ACT.13.11	And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and 
ACT.13.14	But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and 
ACT.13.15	And 
ACT.13.16	Then Paul stood up, and motioning with 
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel 
ACT.13.18	Now 
ACT.13.19	And when He had destroyed 
ACT.13.20	“After that 
ACT.13.21	And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them 
ACT.13.22	And 
ACT.13.23	From this man’s seed, according 
ACT.13.24	after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	And as John was finishing his course, he said, 
ACT.13.26	“Men 
ACT.13.27	For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, 
ACT.13.28	And though they found no cause for death 
ACT.13.29	Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, 
ACT.13.30	But God raised Him from the dead. 
ACT.13.31	He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we declare to you glad tidings—
ACT.13.33	God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm:
ACT.13.33	‘You are My Son,
ACT.13.33	Today I have begotten You.’
ACT.13.34	And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus:
ACT.13.34	‘I will give you the sure mercies of David.’
ACT.13.35	Therefore He also says in another 
ACT.13.35	‘You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.’
ACT.13.36	“For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, 
ACT.13.37	but He whom God raised up saw no corruption. 
ACT.13.38	Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that 
ACT.13.39	and 
ACT.13.40	Beware therefore, lest what has been spoken in the prophets come upon you:
ACT.13.41	‘Behold,
ACT.13.41	Marvel and perish!
ACT.13.41	For I work a work in your days,
ACT.13.41	A work which you will by no means believe,
ACT.13.41	Though one were to declare it to you.’ ”
ACT.13.42	So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, 
ACT.13.44	On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they 
ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, 
ACT.13.47	For so the Lord has commanded us:
ACT.13.47	‘I have set you as a light to the Gentiles,
ACT.13.47	That you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”
ACT.13.48	Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, 
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples 
ACT.14.1	Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the 
ACT.14.2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. 
ACT.14.3	Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, 
ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was 
ACT.14.5	And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, 
ACT.14.6	they became aware of it and 
ACT.14.7	And they were preaching the gospel there.
ACT.14.8	And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	 man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed, 
ACT.14.10	said with a loud voice, 
ACT.14.11	Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian 
ACT.14.12	And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. 
ACT.14.13	Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, 
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, 
ACT.14.15	and saying, “Men, 
ACT.14.16	who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. 
ACT.14.17	Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, 
ACT.14.18	And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
ACT.14.19	Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, 
ACT.14.20	However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the gospel to that city 
ACT.14.22	strengthening the souls of the disciples, 
ACT.14.23	So when they had 
ACT.14.24	And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.
ACT.14.27	Now when they had come and gathered the church together, 
ACT.14.28	So they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	And 
ACT.15.2	Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that 
ACT.15.3	So, 
ACT.15.4	And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. 
ACT.15.5	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command 
ACT.15.6	Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. 
ACT.15.7	And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up 
ACT.15.8	So God, 
ACT.15.9	and made no distinction between us and them, 
ACT.15.10	Now therefore, why do you test God 
ACT.15.11	But 
ACT.15.12	Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had 
ACT.15.13	And after they had become silent, 
ACT.15.14	Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. 
ACT.15.15	And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:
ACT.15.16	‘After
ACT.15.16	And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down;
ACT.15.16	I will rebuild its ruins,
ACT.15.16	And I will set it up;
ACT.15.17	So that the rest of mankind may seek the 
ACT.15.17	Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name,
ACT.15.17	Says the 
ACT.15.18	“Known to God from eternity are all His works. 
ACT.15.19	Therefore 
ACT.15.20	but that we 
ACT.15.21	For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, 
ACT.15.22	Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, 
ACT.15.23	They wrote this 
ACT.15.23	The apostles, the elders, and the brethren,
ACT.15.23	To the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:
ACT.15.23	Greetings.
ACT.15.24	Since we have heard that 
ACT.15.25	it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth. 
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: 
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from things offered to idols, 
ACT.15.29	Farewell.
ACT.15.30	So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement. 
ACT.15.32	Now Judas and Silas, themselves being 
ACT.15.33	And after they had stayed 
ACT.15.34	However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there. 
ACT.15.35	Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
ACT.15.36	Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, 
ACT.15.37	Now Barnabas was determined to take with them 
ACT.15.38	But Paul insisted that they should not take with them 
ACT.15.39	Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to 
ACT.15.40	but Paul chose Silas and departed, 
ACT.15.41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, 
ACT.16.1	Then he came to 
ACT.16.2	He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he 
ACT.16.4	And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
ACT.16.6	Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of 
ACT.16.7	After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them. 
ACT.16.8	So passing by Mysia, they 
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A 
ACT.16.10	Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go 
ACT.16.11	Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next 
ACT.16.12	and from there to 
ACT.16.13	And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met 
ACT.16.14	Now a certain woman named Lydia heard 
ACT.16.15	And when she and her household were baptized, she begged 
ACT.16.16	Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl 
ACT.16.17	This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.” 
ACT.16.18	And this she did for many days.
ACT.16.18	But Paul, 
ACT.16.19	But 
ACT.16.20	And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, “These men, being Jews, 
ACT.16.21	and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe.” 
ACT.16.22	Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes 
ACT.16.23	And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw 
ACT.16.24	Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. 
ACT.16.26	Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately 
ACT.16.27	And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, “Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.”
ACT.16.29	Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	And he brought them out and said, 
ACT.16.31	So they said, 
ACT.16.32	Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night and washed 
ACT.16.34	Now when he had brought them into his house, 
ACT.16.35	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, “Let those men go.”
ACT.16.36	So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.”
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us openly, uncondemned 
ACT.16.38	And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. 
ACT.16.39	Then they came and pleaded with them and brought 
ACT.16.40	So they went out of the prison 
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to 
ACT.17.2	Then Paul, as his custom was, 
ACT.17.3	explaining and demonstrating 
ACT.17.4	And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and 
ACT.17.5	But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming 
ACT.17.6	But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, 
ACT.17.7	Jason has harbored them, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, 
ACT.17.8	And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things. 
ACT.17.9	So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	Then 
ACT.17.11	These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and 
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds. 
ACT.17.14	Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there. 
ACT.17.15	So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and 
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, 
ACT.17.17	Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the 
ACT.17.18	Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, “What does this babbler want to say?”
ACT.17.18	Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,” because he preached to them 
ACT.17.19	And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new doctrine 
ACT.17.20	For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.” 
ACT.17.21	For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
ACT.17.22	Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 
ACT.17.23	for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:
ACT.17.23	TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.
ACT.17.23	Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: 
ACT.17.24	“God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is 
ACT.17.25	Nor is He worshiped with men’s hands, as though He needed anything, since He 
ACT.17.26	And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and 
ACT.17.27	so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, 
ACT.17.28	for 
ACT.17.29	Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, 
ACT.17.30	Truly, 
ACT.17.31	because He has appointed a day on which 
ACT.17.32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, “We will hear you again on this 
ACT.17.33	So Paul departed from among them. 
ACT.17.34	However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After these things Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	And he found a certain Jew named 
ACT.18.3	So, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them 
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.18.5	When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was 
ACT.18.6	But 
ACT.18.7	And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain 
ACT.18.8	Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	Now 
ACT.18.11	And he continued 
ACT.18.12	When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat, 
ACT.18.13	saying, “This 
ACT.18.14	And when Paul was about to open 
ACT.18.15	But if it is a 
ACT.18.16	And he drove them from the judgment seat. 
ACT.18.17	Then all the Greeks took 
ACT.18.18	So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila 
ACT.18.19	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	When they asked 
ACT.18.21	but took leave of them, saying, 
ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at 
ACT.18.23	After he had spent some time 
ACT.18.24	Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man 
ACT.18.25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being 
ACT.18.26	So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. 
ACT.18.27	And when he desired to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, 
ACT.18.28	for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, 
ACT.19.1	And it happened, while 
ACT.19.2	he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
ACT.19.2	So they said to him, 
ACT.19.3	And he said to them, “Into what then were you baptized?”
ACT.19.3	So they said, 
ACT.19.4	Then Paul said, 
ACT.19.5	When they heard 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had 
ACT.19.7	Now the men were about twelve in all.
ACT.19.8	And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading 
ACT.19.9	But 
ACT.19.10	And 
ACT.19.11	Now 
ACT.19.12	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. 
ACT.19.13	Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists 
ACT.19.14	Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.
ACT.19.15	And the evil spirit answered and said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”
ACT.19.16	Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and 
ACT.19.18	And many who had believed came 
ACT.19.19	Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned 
ACT.19.20	So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	When these things were accomplished, Paul 
ACT.19.22	So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, 
ACT.19.23	And 
ACT.19.24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought 
ACT.19.25	He called them together with the workers of similar occupation, and said: “Men, you know that we have our prosperity by this trade. 
ACT.19.26	Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that 
ACT.19.27	So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.”
ACT.19.28	Now when they heard 
ACT.19.29	So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized 
ACT.19.30	And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him. 
ACT.19.31	Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater. 
ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together. 
ACT.19.33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And 
ACT.19.34	But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, “Great 
ACT.19.35	And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: “Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Diana, and of the 
ACT.19.36	Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly. 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess. 
ACT.19.38	Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. 
ACT.19.39	But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger of being called in question for today’s uproar, there being no reason which we may give to account for this disorderly gathering.” 
ACT.19.41	And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to 
ACT.20.2	Now when he had gone over that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to 
ACT.20.3	and stayed three months. And 
ACT.20.4	And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia—also 
ACT.20.5	These men, going ahead, waited for us at 
ACT.20.6	But we sailed away from Philippi after 
ACT.20.7	Now on 
ACT.20.8	There were many lamps 
ACT.20.9	And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. 
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down, 
ACT.20.11	Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed. 
ACT.20.12	And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted.
ACT.20.13	Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so he had given orders, intending himself to go on foot. 
ACT.20.14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	We sailed from there, and the next 
ACT.20.16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for 
ACT.20.17	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	And when they had come to him, he said to them: “You know, 
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me 
ACT.20.20	how 
ACT.20.21	testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, 
ACT.20.22	And see, now 
ACT.20.23	except that 
ACT.20.24	But 
ACT.20.25	“And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore I testify to you this day that I 
ACT.20.27	For I have not shunned to declare to you 
ACT.20.28	Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit 
ACT.20.29	For I know this, that after my departure 
ACT.20.30	Also 
ACT.20.31	Therefore watch, and remember that 
ACT.20.32	“So now, brethren, I commend you to God and 
ACT.20.33	I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel. 
ACT.20.34	Yes, you yourselves know 
ACT.20.35	I have shown you in every way, 
ACT.20.36	And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	Then they all 
ACT.20.38	sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
ACT.21.1	Now it came to pass, that when we had departed from them and set sail, running a straight course we came to Cos, the following 
ACT.21.2	And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo. 
ACT.21.4	And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. 
ACT.21.5	When we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with wives and children, till 
ACT.21.6	When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned 
ACT.21.7	And when we had finished 
ACT.21.8	On the next 
ACT.21.9	Now this man had four virgin daughters 
ACT.21.10	And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named 
ACT.21.11	When he had come to us, he took Paul’s belt, bound his 
ACT.21.12	Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, 
ACT.21.14	So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, 
ACT.21.15	And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.
ACT.21.17	And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
ACT.21.18	On the following 
ACT.21.19	When he had greeted them, 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard 
ACT.21.21	but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise 
ACT.21.22	What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come. 
ACT.21.23	Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow. 
ACT.21.24	Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may 
ACT.21.25	But concerning the Gentiles who believe, 
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, 
ACT.21.27	Now when the seven days were almost ended, 
ACT.21.28	crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man 
ACT.21.29	(For they had previously seen 
ACT.21.30	And 
ACT.21.31	Now as they were 
ACT.21.32	He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the 
ACT.21.34	And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another.
ACT.21.34	So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks. 
ACT.21.35	When he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob. 
ACT.21.36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, 
ACT.21.37	Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, “May I speak to you?”
ACT.21.37	He replied, “Can you speak Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?”
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, 
ACT.21.40	So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and 
ACT.22.1	“Brethren
ACT.22.2	And when they heard that he spoke to them in the 
ACT.22.2	Then he said: 
ACT.22.3	“I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city 
ACT.22.4	I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, 
ACT.22.5	as also the high priest bears me witness, and 
ACT.22.6	“Now 
ACT.22.7	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 
ACT.22.8	So I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, 
ACT.22.9	“And 
ACT.22.10	So I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.11	And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	“Then 
ACT.22.13	came to me; and he stood and said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And at that same hour I looked up at him. 
ACT.22.14	Then he said, 
ACT.22.15	For you will be His witness to all men of 
ACT.22.16	And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, 
ACT.22.17	“Now 
ACT.22.18	and 
ACT.22.19	So I said, ‘Lord, 
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by 
ACT.22.21	Then He said to me, 
ACT.22.22	And they listened to him until this word, and 
ACT.22.23	Then, as they cried out and tore off 
ACT.22.24	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined under scourging, so that he might know why they shouted so against him. 
ACT.22.25	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, 
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard 
ACT.22.27	Then the commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?”
ACT.22.27	He said, “Yes.”
ACT.22.28	The commander answered, “With a large sum I obtained this citizenship.”
ACT.22.28	And Paul said, “But I was born 
ACT.22.29	Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him; and the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
ACT.22.30	The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from 
ACT.23.1	Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, “Men 
ACT.23.2	And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, 
ACT.23.4	And those who stood by said, “Do you revile God’s high priest?”
ACT.23.5	Then Paul said, 
ACT.23.6	But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Men 
ACT.23.7	And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection—and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. 
ACT.23.9	Then there arose a loud outcry. And the scribes of the Pharisees’ party arose and protested, saying, 
ACT.23.10	Now when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring 
ACT.23.11	But 
ACT.23.12	And when it was day, 
ACT.23.13	Now there were more than forty who had formed this conspiracy. 
ACT.23.14	They came to the chief priests and 
ACT.23.15	Now you, therefore, together with the council, suggest to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to make further inquiries concerning him; but we are ready to kill him before he comes near.”
ACT.23.16	So when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the centurions to 
ACT.23.18	So he took him and brought 
ACT.23.19	Then the commander took him by the hand, went aside, and asked privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?”
ACT.23.20	And he said, 
ACT.23.21	But do not yield to them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.”
ACT.23.22	So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded 
ACT.23.23	And he called for two centurions, saying, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to 
ACT.23.24	and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring 
ACT.23.25	He wrote a letter in the following manner:
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias,
ACT.23.26	To the most excellent governor Felix:
ACT.23.26	Greetings.
ACT.23.27	This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. Coming with the troops I rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. 
ACT.23.28	And when I wanted to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council. 
ACT.23.29	I found out that he was accused 
ACT.23.30	And 
ACT.23.30	Farewell.
ACT.23.31	Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought 
ACT.23.32	The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks. 
ACT.23.33	When they came to 
ACT.23.34	And when the governor had read 
ACT.23.35	he said, 
ACT.24.1	Now after 
ACT.24.2	And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: “Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your foresight, 
ACT.24.3	we accept 
ACT.24.4	Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man a plague, a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 
ACT.24.6	He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and wanted 
ACT.24.7	But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took 
ACT.24.8	commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.” 
ACT.24.9	And the Jews also assented, maintaining that these things were so.
ACT.24.10	Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: “Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, 
ACT.24.11	because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem 
ACT.24.12	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city. 
ACT.24.13	Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. 
ACT.24.14	But this I confess to you, that according to 
ACT.24.15	I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, 
ACT.24.16	This 
ACT.24.17	“Now after many years 
ACT.24.18	in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me 
ACT.24.19	They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or else let those who are 
ACT.24.21	unless 
ACT.24.22	But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of 
ACT.24.23	So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let 
ACT.24.24	And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the 
ACT.24.25	Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, “Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.” 
ACT.24.26	Meanwhile he also hoped that 
ACT.24.27	But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, 
ACT.25.1	Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from 
ACT.25.2	Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they petitioned him, 
ACT.25.3	asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem—
ACT.25.4	But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going 
ACT.25.5	“Therefore,” he said, “let those who have authority among you go down with 
ACT.25.6	And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought. 
ACT.25.7	When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about 
ACT.25.8	while he answered for himself, 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, 
ACT.25.10	So Paul said, “I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know. 
ACT.25.11	For if I am an offender, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not object to dying; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. 
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!”
ACT.25.13	And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. 
ACT.25.14	When they had been there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying: 
ACT.25.15	about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed 
ACT.25.16	To them I answered, ‘It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the charge against him.’ 
ACT.25.17	Therefore when they had come together, 
ACT.25.18	When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed, 
ACT.25.19	but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. 
ACT.25.20	And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul 
ACT.25.22	Then 
ACT.25.22	“Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.”
ACT.25.23	So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus’ command 
ACT.25.24	And Festus said: “King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom 
ACT.25.25	But when I found that 
ACT.25.26	I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are permitted to speak for yourself.”
ACT.26.1	So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself: 
ACT.26.2	“I think myself 
ACT.26.3	especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
ACT.26.4	“My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know. 
ACT.26.5	They knew me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to 
ACT.26.6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of 
ACT.26.7	To this 
ACT.26.8	Why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?
ACT.26.9	“Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of 
ACT.26.10	This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority 
ACT.26.11	And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled 
ACT.26.12	“While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
ACT.26.13	at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, 
ACT.26.15	So I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said, 
ACT.26.19	“Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 
ACT.26.20	but 
ACT.26.21	For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill 
ACT.26.22	Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those 
ACT.26.23	that the Christ would suffer, 
ACT.26.24	Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, 
ACT.26.25	But he said, “I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and reason. 
ACT.26.26	For the king, before whom I also speak freely, 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.”
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You almost persuade me to become a Christian.”
ACT.26.29	And Paul said, 
ACT.26.30	When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them; 
ACT.26.31	and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, 
ACT.26.32	Then Agrippa said to Festus, “This man might have been set 
ACT.27.1	And when 
ACT.27.2	So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. 
ACT.27.3	And the next 
ACT.27.4	When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under 
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, 
ACT.27.6	There the centurion found 
ACT.27.7	When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under 
ACT.27.8	Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city 
ACT.27.9	Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous 
ACT.27.10	saying, “Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.” 
ACT.27.11	Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul. 
ACT.27.12	And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, 
ACT.27.13	When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained 
ACT.27.14	But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called Euroclydon. 
ACT.27.15	So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let 
ACT.27.16	And running under 
ACT.27.17	When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the Syrtis 
ACT.27.18	And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next 
ACT.27.19	On the third 
ACT.27.20	Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on 
ACT.27.21	But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss. 
ACT.27.22	And now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 
ACT.27.23	For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and 
ACT.27.24	saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	Therefore take heart, men, 
ACT.27.26	However, 
ACT.27.27	Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic 
ACT.27.28	And they took soundings and found 
ACT.27.29	Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come. 
ACT.27.30	And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the skiff into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow, 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.
ACT.27.33	And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored 
ACT.27.34	Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, 
ACT.27.35	And when he had said these things, he took bread and 
ACT.27.36	Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves. 
ACT.27.37	And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six 
ACT.27.38	So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.
ACT.27.39	When it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible. 
ACT.27.40	And they let go the anchors and left 
ACT.27.41	But striking a place where two seas met, 
ACT.27.42	And the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape. 
ACT.27.43	But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from 
ACT.27.44	and the rest, some on boards and some on 
ACT.28.1	Now when they had escaped, they then found out that 
ACT.28.2	And the 
ACT.28.3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid 
ACT.28.4	So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.” 
ACT.28.5	But he shook off the creature into the fire and 
ACT.28.6	However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and 
ACT.28.7	In that region there was an estate of the leading citizen of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and entertained us courteously for three days. 
ACT.28.8	And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and 
ACT.28.9	So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed. 
ACT.28.10	They also honored us in many 
ACT.28.11	After three months we sailed in 
ACT.28.12	And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we circled round and reached Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli, 
ACT.28.14	where we found 
ACT.28.15	And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
ACT.28.16	Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but 
ACT.28.17	And it came to pass after three days that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: “Men 
ACT.28.18	who, 
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews spoke against 
ACT.28.20	For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see 
ACT.28.21	Then they said to him, “We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you. 
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that 
ACT.28.23	So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at 
ACT.28.24	And 
ACT.28.25	So when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had said one word: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, 
ACT.28.26	saying,
ACT.28.26	‘Go to this people and say:
ACT.28.26	“Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand;
ACT.28.26	And seeing you will see, and not perceive;
ACT.28.27	For the hearts of this people have grown dull.
ACT.28.27	 ears are hard of hearing,
ACT.28.27	And their eyes they have closed,
ACT.28.27	Lest they should see with 
ACT.28.27	Lest they should understand with 
ACT.28.27	So that I should heal them.” ’
ACT.28.28	“Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent 
ACT.28.29	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.
ACT.28.30	Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, 
ACT.28.31	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.
ROM.1.1	Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, 
ROM.1.2	which He promised before 
ROM.1.3	concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was 
ROM.1.5	Through Him 
ROM.1.6	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
ROM.1.7	To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, 
ROM.1.7	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.8	First, 
ROM.1.9	For 
ROM.1.10	making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that 
ROM.1.12	that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by 
ROM.1.13	Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but 
ROM.1.14	I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise. 
ROM.1.15	So, as much as is in me, 
ROM.1.16	For 
ROM.1.17	For 
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and 
ROM.1.19	because 
ROM.1.20	For since the creation of the world 
ROM.1.21	because, although they knew God, they did not glorify 
ROM.1.22	Professing to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	and changed the glory of the 
ROM.1.24	Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, 
ROM.1.25	who exchanged 
ROM.1.26	For this reason God gave them up to 
ROM.1.27	Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.
ROM.1.28	And even as they did not like to retain God in 
ROM.1.29	being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; 
ROM.1.30	backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; 
ROM.1.32	who, 
ROM.2.1	Therefore you are 
ROM.2.2	But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. 
ROM.2.3	And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? 
ROM.2.4	Or do you despise 
ROM.2.5	But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart 
ROM.2.6	who 
ROM.2.7	eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality; 
ROM.2.8	but to those who are self-seeking and 
ROM.2.9	tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew 
ROM.2.10	but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.2.11	For 
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law 
ROM.2.13	(for 
ROM.2.14	for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves, 
ROM.2.15	who show the 
ROM.2.16	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men 
ROM.2.17	Indeed 
ROM.2.18	and 
ROM.2.19	and 
ROM.2.20	an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, 
ROM.2.21	You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	You who say, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, 
ROM.2.23	You who 
ROM.2.24	For 
ROM.2.25	For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the law; but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
ROM.2.26	Therefore, 
ROM.2.27	And will not the physically uncircumcised, if he fulfills the law, 
ROM.2.28	For 
ROM.2.29	but 
ROM.3.1	What advantage then has the Jew, or what 
ROM.3.2	Much in every way! Chiefly because 
ROM.3.3	For what if 
ROM.3.4	Certainly not! Indeed, let 
ROM.3.4	“That You may be justified in Your words,
ROM.3.4	And may overcome when You are judged.”
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? 
ROM.3.6	Certainly not! For then 
ROM.3.7	For if the truth of God has increased through my lie to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	And 
ROM.3.9	What then? Are we better 
ROM.3.10	As it is written:
ROM.3.10	“There is none righteous, no, not one;
ROM.3.11	There is none who understands;
ROM.3.11	There is none who seeks after God.
ROM.3.12	They have all turned aside;
ROM.3.12	They have together become unprofitable;
ROM.3.12	There is none who does good, no, not one.”
ROM.3.13	“Their
ROM.3.13	With their tongues they have practiced deceit”; 
ROM.3.13	“The poison of asps 
ROM.3.14	“Whose
ROM.3.15	“Their
ROM.3.16	Destruction and misery 
ROM.3.17	And the way of peace they have not known.”
ROM.3.18	“There
ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever 
ROM.3.20	Therefore 
ROM.3.21	But now 
ROM.3.22	even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For 
ROM.3.23	for 
ROM.3.24	being justified freely 
ROM.3.25	whom God set forth 
ROM.3.26	to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	Where 
ROM.3.28	Therefore we conclude 
ROM.3.29	Or 
ROM.3.30	since 
ROM.3.31	Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say that 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham was 
ROM.4.3	For what does the Scripture say? 
ROM.4.4	Now 
ROM.4.5	But to him who 
ROM.4.6	just as David also 
ROM.4.7	“Blessed
ROM.4.7	And whose sins are covered;
ROM.4.8	Blessed 
ROM.4.9	 this blessedness then 
ROM.4.10	How then was it accounted? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised. 
ROM.4.11	And 
ROM.4.12	and the father of circumcision to those who not only 
ROM.4.13	For the promise that he would be the 
ROM.4.14	For 
ROM.4.15	because 
ROM.4.16	Therefore 
ROM.4.17	(as it is written, 
ROM.4.18	who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, 
ROM.4.19	And not being weak in faith, 
ROM.4.20	He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, 
ROM.4.21	and being fully convinced that what He had promised 
ROM.4.22	And therefore 
ROM.4.23	Now 
ROM.4.24	but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe 
ROM.4.25	who was delivered up because of our offenses, and 
ROM.5.1	Therefore, 
ROM.5.2	through whom also we have access by faith into this grace 
ROM.5.3	And not only 
ROM.5.4	and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 
ROM.5.5	Now hope does not disappoint, 
ROM.5.6	For when we were still without strength, in due time 
ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But 
ROM.5.9	Much more then, having now been justified 
ROM.5.10	For 
ROM.5.11	And not only 
ROM.5.12	Therefore, just as 
ROM.5.13	(For until the law sin was in the world, but 
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, 
ROM.5.15	But the free gift 
ROM.5.16	And the gift 
ROM.5.17	For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)
ROM.5.18	Therefore, as through one man’s offense 
ROM.5.19	For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by 
ROM.5.20	Moreover 
ROM.5.21	so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? 
ROM.6.2	Certainly not! How shall we who 
ROM.6.3	Or do you not know that 
ROM.6.4	Therefore we were 
ROM.6.5	For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be 
ROM.6.6	knowing this, that 
ROM.6.7	For 
ROM.6.8	Now 
ROM.6.9	knowing that 
ROM.6.10	For 
ROM.6.11	Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be 
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. 
ROM.6.13	And do not present your 
ROM.6.14	For 
ROM.6.15	What then? Shall we sin 
ROM.6.16	Do you not know that 
ROM.6.17	But God be thanked that 
ROM.6.18	And 
ROM.6.19	I speak in human 
ROM.6.20	For when you were 
ROM.6.21	What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For 
ROM.6.22	But now 
ROM.6.23	For 
ROM.7.1	Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? 
ROM.7.2	For 
ROM.7.3	So then 
ROM.7.4	Therefore, my brethren, you also have become 
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law 
ROM.7.6	But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve 
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? 
ROM.7.8	But 
ROM.7.9	I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. 
ROM.7.10	And the commandment, 
ROM.7.11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed 
ROM.7.12	Therefore 
ROM.7.13	Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. 
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, 
ROM.7.15	For what I am doing, I do not understand. 
ROM.7.16	If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that 
ROM.7.17	But now, 
ROM.7.18	For I know that 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I will 
ROM.7.20	Now if I do what I will not 
ROM.7.21	I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. 
ROM.7.22	For I 
ROM.7.23	But 
ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me 
ROM.7.25	I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!
ROM.7.25	So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
ROM.8.2	For 
ROM.8.3	For 
ROM.8.4	that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who 
ROM.8.5	For 
ROM.8.6	For 
ROM.8.7	Because 
ROM.8.8	So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. 
ROM.8.10	And if Christ 
ROM.8.11	But if the Spirit of 
ROM.8.12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors—not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 
ROM.8.13	For 
ROM.8.14	For 
ROM.8.15	For 
ROM.8.16	The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 
ROM.8.17	and if children, then 
ROM.8.18	For I consider that 
ROM.8.19	For 
ROM.8.20	For 
ROM.8.21	because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious 
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation 
ROM.8.23	Not only 
ROM.8.24	For we were saved in this hope, but 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for 
ROM.8.26	Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For 
ROM.8.27	Now 
ROM.8.28	And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those 
ROM.8.29	For whom 
ROM.8.30	Moreover whom He predestined, these He also 
ROM.8.31	What then shall we say to these things? 
ROM.8.32	He who did not spare His own Son, but 
ROM.8.33	Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? 
ROM.8.34	Who 
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? 
ROM.8.36	As it is written:
ROM.8.36	“For Your sake we are killed all day long;
ROM.8.36	We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”
ROM.8.37	Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor 
ROM.8.39	nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I 
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites, 
ROM.9.5	of whom 
ROM.9.6	But it is not that the word of God has taken no effect. For 
ROM.9.7	nor 
ROM.9.8	That is, those who 
ROM.9.9	For this 
ROM.9.10	And not only 
ROM.9.11	(for 
ROM.9.12	it was said to her, 
ROM.9.13	As it is written, 
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? 
ROM.9.15	For He says to Moses, 
ROM.9.16	So then 
ROM.9.17	For 
ROM.9.18	Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He 
ROM.9.19	You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For 
ROM.9.20	But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? 
ROM.9.21	Does not the 
ROM.9.22	 if God, wanting to show 
ROM.9.23	and that He might make known 
ROM.9.24	even us whom He 
ROM.9.25	As He says also in Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“I will call them My people, who were not My people,
ROM.9.25	And her beloved, who was not beloved.”
ROM.9.26	“And
ROM.9.26	‘You 
ROM.9.26	There they shall be called sons of the living God.”
ROM.9.27	Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel:
ROM.9.27	“Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea,
ROM.9.27	The remnant will be saved.
ROM.9.28	For He will finish the work and cut 
ROM.9.28	Because the 
ROM.9.29	And as Isaiah said before:
ROM.9.29	“Unless the 
ROM.9.29	We would have become like Sodom,
ROM.9.29	And we would have been made like Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? 
ROM.9.31	but Israel, 
ROM.9.32	Why? Because 
ROM.9.33	As it is written:
ROM.9.33	“Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense,
ROM.9.33	And 
ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. 
ROM.10.2	For I bear them witness 
ROM.10.3	For they being ignorant of 
ROM.10.4	For 
ROM.10.5	For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, 
ROM.10.7	or, 
ROM.10.8	But what does it say? 
ROM.10.9	that 
ROM.10.10	For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
ROM.10.11	For the Scripture says, 
ROM.10.12	For 
ROM.10.13	For 
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear 
ROM.10.15	And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:
ROM.10.15	“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace,
ROM.10.15	Who bring glad tidings of good things!”
ROM.10.16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, 
ROM.10.17	So then faith 
ROM.10.18	But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed:
ROM.10.18	“Their sound has gone out to all the earth,
ROM.10.18	And their words to the ends of the world.”
ROM.10.19	But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says:
ROM.10.19	“I will provoke you to jealousy by 
ROM.10.19	I will move you to anger by a 
ROM.10.20	But Isaiah is very bold and says:
ROM.10.20	“I was found by those who did not seek Me;
ROM.10.20	I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me.”
ROM.10.21	But to Israel he says:
ROM.10.21	“All day long I have stretched out My hands
ROM.10.21	To a disobedient and contrary people.”
ROM.11.1	I say then, 
ROM.11.2	God has not cast away His people whom 
ROM.11.3	“
ROM.11.4	But what does the divine response say to him? 
ROM.11.5	Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 
ROM.11.6	And 
ROM.11.7	What then? 
ROM.11.8	Just as it is written:
ROM.11.8	“God has given them a spirit of stupor,
ROM.11.8	Eyes that they should not see
ROM.11.8	And ears that they should not hear,
ROM.11.8	To this very day.”
ROM.11.9	And David says:
ROM.11.9	“Let their table become a snare and a trap,
ROM.11.9	A stumbling block and a recompense to them.
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see,
ROM.11.10	And bow down their back always.”
ROM.11.11	I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But 
ROM.11.12	Now if their fall 
ROM.11.13	For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as 
ROM.11.14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy 
ROM.11.15	For if their being cast away 
ROM.11.16	For if 
ROM.11.17	And if 
ROM.11.18	do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, 
ROM.11.19	You will say then, “Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	Well 
ROM.11.21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either. 
ROM.11.22	Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, 
ROM.11.23	And they also, 
ROM.11.24	For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who 
ROM.11.25	For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be 
ROM.11.26	And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written:
ROM.11.26	“The Deliverer will come out of Zion,
ROM.11.26	And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;
ROM.11.27	For 
ROM.11.27	When I take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	Concerning the gospel 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and the calling of God 
ROM.11.30	For as you 
ROM.11.31	even so these also have now been disobedient, that through the mercy shown you they also may obtain mercy. 
ROM.11.32	For God has committed them 
ROM.11.33	Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable 
ROM.11.34	“For who has known the 
ROM.11.34	Or 
ROM.11.35	“Or
ROM.11.35	And it shall be repaid to him?”
ROM.11.36	For 
ROM.12.1	I 
ROM.12.2	And 
ROM.12.3	For I say, 
ROM.12.4	For 
ROM.12.5	so 
ROM.12.6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is 
ROM.12.7	or ministry, 
ROM.12.8	he who exhorts, in exhortation; 
ROM.12.9	 love 
ROM.12.10	 kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, 
ROM.12.11	not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope, 
ROM.12.13	distributing to the needs of the saints, 
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	Be of the same mind toward one another. 
ROM.12.17	Repay no one evil for evil. 
ROM.12.18	If it is possible, as much as depends on you, 
ROM.12.19	Beloved, 
ROM.12.20	Therefore
ROM.12.20	“If your enemy is hungry, feed him;
ROM.12.20	If he is thirsty, give him a drink;
ROM.12.20	For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.”
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but 
ROM.13.1	Let every soul be 
ROM.13.2	Therefore whoever resists 
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? 
ROM.13.4	For he is God’s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God’s minister, an avenger to 
ROM.13.5	Therefore 
ROM.13.6	For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing. 
ROM.13.7	Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes 
ROM.13.8	Owe no one anything except to love one another, for 
ROM.13.9	For the commandments, 
ROM.13.10	Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore 
ROM.13.11	And 
ROM.13.12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand. 
ROM.13.13	Let us walk properly, as in the day, 
ROM.13.14	But 
ROM.14.1	Receive
ROM.14.2	For one believes he 
ROM.14.3	Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.
ROM.14.5	One person esteems 
ROM.14.6	He who 
ROM.14.7	For 
ROM.14.8	For if we 
ROM.14.9	For 
ROM.14.10	But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For 
ROM.14.11	For it is written:
ROM.14.11	“
ROM.14.11	Every knee shall bow to Me,
ROM.14.11	And every tongue shall confess to God.”
ROM.14.12	So then 
ROM.14.13	Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, 
ROM.14.14	I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus 
ROM.14.15	Yet if your brother is grieved because of 
ROM.14.16	Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil; 
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and 
ROM.14.18	For he who serves Christ in these things 
ROM.14.19	Therefore let us pursue the things 
ROM.14.20	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. 
ROM.14.22	Do you have faith? Have 
ROM.14.23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because 
ROM.15.1	We 
ROM.15.2	Let each of us please 
ROM.15.3	For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, 
ROM.15.4	For 
ROM.15.5	Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, 
ROM.15.6	that you may 
ROM.15.7	Therefore 
ROM.15.8	Now I say that 
ROM.15.9	and 
ROM.15.9	“For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles,
ROM.15.9	And sing to Your name.”
ROM.15.10	And again he says:
ROM.15.10	“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people!”
ROM.15.11	And again:
ROM.15.11	“Praise the 
ROM.15.11	Laud Him, all you peoples!”
ROM.15.12	And again, Isaiah says:
ROM.15.12	“There shall be a root of Jesse;
ROM.15.12	And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles,
ROM.15.12	In Him the Gentiles shall hope.”
ROM.15.13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all 
ROM.15.14	Now 
ROM.15.15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on 
ROM.15.16	that 
ROM.15.17	Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus 
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things 
ROM.15.19	in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
ROM.15.20	And so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, 
ROM.15.21	but as it is written:
ROM.15.21	“To whom He was not announced, they shall see;
ROM.15.21	And those who have not heard shall understand.”
ROM.15.22	For this reason 
ROM.15.23	But now no longer having a place in these parts, and 
ROM.15.24	whenever I journey to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, 
ROM.15.25	But now 
ROM.15.26	For 
ROM.15.27	It pleased them indeed, and they are their debtors. For 
ROM.15.28	Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them 
ROM.15.29	But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
ROM.15.30	Now I beg you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
ROM.15.31	that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and that 
ROM.15.32	that I may come to you with joy 
ROM.15.33	Now 
ROM.16.1	I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in 
ROM.16.2	that you may receive her in the Lord 
ROM.16.3	Greet 
ROM.16.4	who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. 
ROM.16.5	Likewise 
ROM.16.5	Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is 
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who labored much for us. 
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junia, my countrymen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the 
ROM.16.8	Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved. 
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the 
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion, my countryman. Greet those who are of the 
ROM.16.12	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who have labored in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, 
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
ROM.16.16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.
ROM.16.17	Now I urge you, brethren, note those 
ROM.16.18	For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but 
ROM.16.19	For 
ROM.16.20	And 
ROM.16.20	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
ROM.16.21	Timothy, my fellow worker, and 
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, who wrote 
ROM.16.23	Gaius, my host and 
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
ROM.16.25	Now 
ROM.16.26	but 
ROM.16.27	to 
1CO.1.1	Paul, 
1CO.1.2	To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who 
1CO.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you by Christ Jesus, 
1CO.1.5	that you were enriched in everything by Him 
1CO.1.6	even as 
1CO.1.7	so that you come short in no gift, eagerly 
1CO.1.8	who will also confirm you to the end, 
1CO.1.9	God 
1CO.1.10	Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1CO.1.11	For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe’s 
1CO.1.12	Now I say this, that 
1CO.1.13	Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I baptized 
1CO.1.15	lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name. 
1CO.1.16	Yes, I also baptized the household of 
1CO.1.17	For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, 
1CO.1.18	For the message of the cross is 
1CO.1.19	For it is written:
1CO.1.19	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
1CO.1.19	And bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.”
1CO.1.20	Where 
1CO.1.21	For since, in the 
1CO.1.22	For 
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified, 
1CO.1.24	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ 
1CO.1.25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For you see your calling, brethren, 
1CO.1.27	But 
1CO.1.28	and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 
1CO.1.29	that no flesh should glory in His presence. 
1CO.1.30	But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and 
1CO.1.31	that, as it is written, 
1CO.2.1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 
1CO.2.2	For I determined not to know anything among you 
1CO.2.3	I was with you 
1CO.2.4	And my speech and my preaching 
1CO.2.5	that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the 
1CO.2.6	However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 
1CO.2.7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden 
1CO.2.8	which none of the rulers of this age knew; for 
1CO.2.9	But as it is written:
1CO.2.9	“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,
1CO.2.9	Nor have entered into the heart of man
1CO.2.9	The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”
1CO.2.10	But 
1CO.2.11	For what man knows the things of a man except the 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but 
1CO.2.13	These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 
1CO.2.14	But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know 
1CO.2.15	But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is 
1CO.2.16	For 
1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual 
1CO.3.2	I fed you with 
1CO.3.3	for you are still carnal. For where 
1CO.3.4	For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I 
1CO.3.5	Who then is Paul, and who 
1CO.3.6	I planted, 
1CO.3.7	So then 
1CO.3.8	Now he who plants and he who waters are one, 
1CO.3.9	For 
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid 
1CO.3.11	For no other foundation can anyone lay than 
1CO.3.12	Now if anyone builds on this foundation 
1CO.3.13	each one’s work will become clear; for the Day 
1CO.3.14	If anyone’s work which he has built on 
1CO.3.15	If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
1CO.3.16	Do you not know that you are the temple of God and 
1CO.3.17	If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which 
1CO.3.18	Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, 
1CO.3.20	and again, 
1CO.3.21	Therefore let no one boast in men. For 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come—all are yours. 
1CO.3.23	And 
1CO.4.1	Let a man so consider us, as 
1CO.4.2	Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful. 
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. 
1CO.4.4	For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord. 
1CO.4.5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to 
1CO.4.6	Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one against the other. 
1CO.4.7	For who makes you differ 
1CO.4.8	You are already full! 
1CO.4.9	For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we have been made a 
1CO.4.10	We 
1CO.4.11	To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and homeless. 
1CO.4.12	And we labor, working with our own hands. 
1CO.4.13	being defamed, we entreat. 
1CO.4.14	I do not write these things to shame you, but 
1CO.4.15	For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet 
1CO.4.16	Therefore I urge you, 
1CO.4.17	For this reason I have sent 
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you shortly, 
1CO.4.20	For 
1CO.4.21	What do you want? 
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported 
1CO.5.2	And you are puffed up, and have not rather 
1CO.5.3	For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed. 
1CO.5.4	In the 
1CO.5.5	deliver such a one to 
1CO.5.6	Your glorying 
1CO.5.7	Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed 
1CO.5.8	Therefore 
1CO.5.9	I wrote to you in my epistle 
1CO.5.10	Yet 
1CO.5.11	But now I have written to you not to keep company 
1CO.5.12	For what 
1CO.5.13	But those who are outside God judges. Therefore 
1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the 
1CO.6.2	Do you not know that 
1CO.6.3	Do you not know that we shall 
1CO.6.4	If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge? 
1CO.6.5	I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren? 
1CO.6.6	But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers!
1CO.6.7	Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. 
1CO.6.8	No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and 
1CO.6.9	Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. 
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	And such were 
1CO.6.12	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. 
1CO.6.13	Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body 
1CO.6.14	And 
1CO.6.15	Do you not know that 
1CO.6.16	Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body 
1CO.6.17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 
1CO.6.18	Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins 
1CO.6.19	Or 
1CO.6.20	For 
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me:
1CO.7.2	Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband 
1CO.7.5	Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that 
1CO.7.6	But I say this as a concession, 
1CO.7.7	For 
1CO.7.8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: 
1CO.7.9	but 
1CO.7.10	Now to the married I command, 
1CO.7.11	But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to 
1CO.7.12	But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such 
1CO.7.16	For how do you know, O wife, whether you will 
1CO.7.17	But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And 
1CO.7.18	Was anyone called while circumcised? 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but 
1CO.7.20	Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called. 
1CO.7.21	Were you called 
1CO.7.22	For he who is called in the Lord 
1CO.7.23	You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. 
1CO.7.24	Brethren, let each one remain with 
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins: 
1CO.7.26	I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress—
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I would spare you.
1CO.7.29	But 
1CO.7.30	those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess, 
1CO.7.31	and those who use this world as not 
1CO.7.32	But I want you to be without care. 
1CO.7.33	But he who is married cares about the things of the world—how he may please 
1CO.7.34	There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman 
1CO.7.35	And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.
1CO.7.36	But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry. 
1CO.7.37	Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well. 
1CO.7.38	So then he who gives 
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, 
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she remains as she is, 
1CO.8.1	Now 
1CO.8.2	And 
1CO.8.3	But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.
1CO.8.4	Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that 
1CO.8.5	For even if there are 
1CO.8.6	yet 
1CO.8.7	However, 
1CO.8.8	But 
1CO.8.9	But 
1CO.8.10	For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, will not 
1CO.8.11	And 
1CO.8.12	But 
1CO.8.13	Therefore, 
1CO.9.1	Am 
1CO.9.2	If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you. For you are 
1CO.9.3	My defense to those who examine me is this: 
1CO.9.4	Do we have no right to eat and drink? 
1CO.9.5	Do we have no right to take along a believing wife, as 
1CO.9.6	Or 
1CO.9.7	Who ever 
1CO.9.8	Do I say these things as a 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moses, 
1CO.9.10	Or does He say 
1CO.9.11	If we have sown spiritual things for you, 
1CO.9.12	If others are partakers of 
1CO.9.12	Nevertheless we have not used this right, but endure all things 
1CO.9.13	Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat 
1CO.9.14	Even so 
1CO.9.15	But 
1CO.9.16	For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this willingly, 
1CO.9.18	What is my reward then? That 
1CO.9.19	For though I am 
1CO.9.20	and 
1CO.9.21	to 
1CO.9.22	to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. 
1CO.9.23	Now this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I may be partaker of it with 
1CO.9.24	Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? 
1CO.9.25	And everyone who competes 
1CO.9.26	Therefore I run thus: 
1CO.9.27	But I discipline my body and 
1CO.10.1	Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under 
1CO.10.2	all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 
1CO.10.3	all ate the same 
1CO.10.4	and all drank the same 
1CO.10.5	But with most of them God was not well pleased, for 
1CO.10.6	Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as 
1CO.10.7	And do not become idolaters as 
1CO.10.8	Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as 
1CO.10.9	nor let us tempt Christ, as 
1CO.10.10	nor complain, as 
1CO.10.11	Now all these things happened to them as examples, and 
1CO.10.12	Therefore 
1CO.10.13	No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but 
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my beloved, 
1CO.10.15	I speak as to 
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	For 
1CO.10.18	Observe 
1CO.10.19	What am I saying then? 
1CO.10.20	Rather, that the things which the Gentiles 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and 
1CO.10.22	Or do we 
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are 
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek his own, but each one 
1CO.10.25	Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake; 
1CO.10.26	for 
1CO.10.27	If any of those who do not believe invites you 
1CO.10.28	But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it 
1CO.10.29	“Conscience,” I say, not your own, but that of the other. For 
1CO.10.30	But if I partake with thanks, why am I evil spoken of for 
1CO.10.31	Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Give no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God, 
1CO.10.33	just 
1CO.11.1	Imitate
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to know that 
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or 
1CO.11.5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is 
1CO.11.7	For a man indeed ought not to cover 
1CO.11.8	For man is not from woman, but woman 
1CO.11.9	Nor was man created for the woman, but woman 
1CO.11.10	For this reason the woman ought to have 
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless, 
1CO.11.12	For as woman 
1CO.11.13	Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? 
1CO.11.15	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for 
1CO.11.16	But 
1CO.11.17	Now in giving these instructions I do not praise 
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when you come together as a church, 
1CO.11.19	For 
1CO.11.20	Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper. 
1CO.11.21	For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of 
1CO.11.22	What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise 
1CO.11.23	For 
1CO.11.24	and when He had given thanks, He broke 
1CO.11.25	In the same manner 
1CO.11.26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death 
1CO.11.27	Therefore whoever eats 
1CO.11.28	But 
1CO.11.29	For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. 
1CO.11.30	For this reason many 
1CO.11.31	For 
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, 
1CO.11.33	Therefore, my brethren, when you 
1CO.11.34	But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now 
1CO.12.2	You know 
1CO.12.3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and 
1CO.12.4	There are diversities of gifts, but 
1CO.12.5	There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God 
1CO.12.7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit 
1CO.12.8	for to one is given 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same Spirit, to another 
1CO.12.10	to another the working of miracles, to another 
1CO.12.11	But one and the same Spirit works all these things, 
1CO.12.12	For 
1CO.12.13	For 
1CO.12.14	For in fact the body is not one member but many.
1CO.12.15	If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body? 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body? 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body 
1CO.12.18	But now 
1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where 
1CO.12.20	But now indeed 
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 
1CO.12.22	No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. 
1CO.12.23	And those 
1CO.12.24	but our presentable 
1CO.12.25	that there should be no schism in the body, but 
1CO.12.26	And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with 
1CO.12.27	Now 
1CO.12.28	And 
1CO.12.29	 all apostles? 
1CO.12.30	Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
1CO.12.31	But 
1CO.13.1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	And though I have 
1CO.13.3	And 
1CO.13.4	Love suffers long 
1CO.13.5	does not behave rudely, 
1CO.13.6	does not rejoice in iniquity, but 
1CO.13.7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1CO.13.8	Love never fails. But whether 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 
1CO.13.10	But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For 
1CO.13.13	And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these 
1CO.14.1	Pursue love, and 
1CO.14.2	For he who 
1CO.14.3	But he who prophesies speaks 
1CO.14.4	He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 
1CO.14.5	I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for he who prophesies 
1CO.14.6	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by 
1CO.14.7	Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or played? 
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle? 
1CO.14.9	So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them 
1CO.14.11	Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks 
1CO.14.12	Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual 
1CO.14.13	Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
1CO.14.15	What is 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” 
1CO.14.17	For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1CO.14.18	I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; 
1CO.14.19	yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1CO.14.20	Brethren, 
1CO.14.21	In the law it is written:
1CO.14.21	“With 
1CO.14.21	I will speak to this people;
1CO.14.21	And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,”
1CO.14.21	says the Lord.
1CO.14.22	Therefore tongues are for a 
1CO.14.23	Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all. 
1CO.14.25	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on 
1CO.14.26	How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, 
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in a tongue, 
1CO.14.28	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let two or three prophets speak, and 
1CO.14.30	But if 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	And 
1CO.14.33	For God is not 
1CO.14.34	Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but 
1CO.14.35	And if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.
1CO.14.36	Or did the word of God come 
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. 
1CO.14.38	But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1CO.14.39	Therefore, brethren, 
1CO.14.40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel 
1CO.15.2	by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless 
1CO.15.3	For 
1CO.15.4	and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day 
1CO.15.5	and that He was seen by Cephas, then 
1CO.15.6	After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.7	After that He was seen by James, then 
1CO.15.8	Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.
1CO.15.9	For I am 
1CO.15.10	But 
1CO.15.11	Therefore, whether 
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, 
1CO.15.14	And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching 
1CO.15.15	Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because 
1CO.15.16	For if 
1CO.15.17	And if Christ is not risen, your faith 
1CO.15.18	Then also those who have fallen 
1CO.15.19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.
1CO.15.20	But now 
1CO.15.21	For 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall 
1CO.15.23	But 
1CO.15.24	Then 
1CO.15.25	For He must reign 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy 
1CO.15.27	For 
1CO.15.28	Now when all things are made subject to Him, then 
1CO.15.29	Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead? 
1CO.15.30	And 
1CO.15.31	I affirm, by 
1CO.15.32	If, in the manner of men, 
1CO.15.33	Do not be deceived: 
1CO.15.34	Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; 
1CO.15.35	But someone will say, 
1CO.15.36	Foolish one, 
1CO.15.37	And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain—perhaps wheat or some other 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body.
1CO.15.39	All flesh 
1CO.15.42	So also 
1CO.15.43	It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 
1CO.15.44	It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	And so it is written, 
1CO.15.46	However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man 
1CO.15.48	As 
1CO.15.49	And 
1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brethren, that 
1CO.15.51	Behold, I tell you a mystery: 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. 
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and 
1CO.15.54	So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: 
1CO.15.55	“O
1CO.15.55	O Hades, where 
1CO.15.56	The sting of death 
1CO.15.57	But thanks 
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing 
1CO.16.1	Now concerning 
1CO.16.2	On the first 
1CO.16.3	And when I come, 
1CO.16.4	But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me.
1CO.16.5	Now I will come to you 
1CO.16.6	And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may 
1CO.16.7	For I do not wish to see you now on the way; but I hope to stay a while with you, 
1CO.16.8	But I will tarry in Ephesus until 
1CO.16.9	For 
1CO.16.10	And 
1CO.16.11	Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey 
1CO.16.12	Now concerning 
1CO.16.13	Watch, 
1CO.16.14	Let all 
1CO.16.15	I urge you, brethren—you know 
1CO.16.16	that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and 
1CO.16.17	I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, 
1CO.16.18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore 
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, 
1CO.16.20	All the brethren greet you.
1CO.16.20	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	The salutation with my own hand—Paul’s.
1CO.16.22	If anyone 
1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
1CO.16.24	My love 
2CO.1.1	Paul, 
2CO.1.1	To the church of God which is at Corinth, 
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Blessed 
2CO.1.4	who 
2CO.1.5	For as 
2CO.1.6	Now if we are afflicted, 
2CO.1.7	And our hope for you 
2CO.1.8	For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of 
2CO.1.9	Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should 
2CO.1.10	who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver 
2CO.1.11	you also 
2CO.1.12	For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and 
2CO.1.13	For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end 
2CO.1.14	(as also you have understood us in part), 
2CO.1.15	And in this confidence 
2CO.1.16	to pass by way of you to Macedonia, 
2CO.1.17	Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan 
2CO.1.18	But 
2CO.1.19	For 
2CO.1.20	For all the promises of God in Him 
2CO.1.21	Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and 
2CO.1.22	who 
2CO.1.23	Moreover 
2CO.1.24	Not 
2CO.2.1	But I determined this within myself, 
2CO.2.2	For if I make you 
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, 
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, 
2CO.2.5	But 
2CO.2.6	This punishment which 
2CO.2.7	so that, on the contrary, you 
2CO.2.8	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm 
2CO.2.9	For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are 
2CO.2.10	Now whom you forgive anything, I also 
2CO.2.11	lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2CO.2.12	Furthermore, 
2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	Now thanks 
2CO.2.15	For we are to God the fragrance of Christ 
2CO.2.16	To the one 
2CO.2.17	For we are not, as so many, 
2CO.3.1	Do 
2CO.3.2	You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men; 
2CO.3.3	clearly you are an epistle of Christ, 
2CO.3.4	And we have such trust through Christ toward God. 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as 
2CO.3.6	who also made us sufficient as 
2CO.3.7	But if 
2CO.3.8	how will 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministry of condemnation 
2CO.3.10	For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. 
2CO.3.11	For if what is passing away 
2CO.3.12	Therefore, since we have such hope, 
2CO.3.13	unlike Moses, 
2CO.3.14	But 
2CO.3.15	But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. 
2CO.3.16	Nevertheless 
2CO.3.17	Now 
2CO.3.18	But we all, with unveiled face, beholding 
2CO.4.1	Therefore, since we have this ministry, 
2CO.4.2	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth 
2CO.4.3	But even if our gospel is veiled, 
2CO.4.4	whose minds 
2CO.4.5	For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and 
2CO.4.6	For it is the God 
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not 
2CO.4.10	always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, 
2CO.4.11	For we who live 
2CO.4.12	So then death is working in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.13	And since we have 
2CO.4.14	knowing that 
2CO.4.15	For 
2CO.4.16	Therefore we 
2CO.4.17	For 
2CO.4.18	while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen 
2CO.5.1	For we know that if 
2CO.5.2	For in this 
2CO.5.3	if indeed, 
2CO.5.4	For we who are in 
2CO.5.5	Now He who has prepared us for this very thing 
2CO.5.6	So 
2CO.5.7	For 
2CO.5.8	We are confident, yes, 
2CO.5.9	Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, 
2CO.5.11	Knowing, therefore, 
2CO.5.12	For 
2CO.5.13	For 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that 
2CO.5.15	and He died for all, 
2CO.5.16	Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, 
2CO.5.17	Therefore, if anyone 
2CO.5.18	Now all things 
2CO.5.19	that is, that 
2CO.5.20	Now then, we are 
2CO.5.21	For 
2CO.6.1	We then, 
2CO.6.2	For He says:
2CO.6.2	“In an acceptable time I have heard you,
2CO.6.2	And in the day of salvation I have helped you.”
2CO.6.2	Behold, now 
2CO.6.3	We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. 
2CO.6.4	But in all 
2CO.6.5	in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; 
2CO.6.6	by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, 
2CO.6.7	by the word of truth, by 
2CO.6.8	by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and 
2CO.6.9	as unknown, and 
2CO.6.10	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many 
2CO.6.11	O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, 
2CO.6.12	You are not restricted by us, but 
2CO.6.13	Now in return for the same 
2CO.6.14	Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For 
2CO.6.15	And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For 
2CO.6.16	“I will dwell in them
2CO.6.16	And walk among them.
2CO.6.16	I will be their God,
2CO.6.16	And they shall be My people.”
2CO.6.17	Therefore
2CO.6.17	“Come out from among them
2CO.6.17	And be separate, says the Lord.
2CO.6.17	Do not touch what is unclean,
2CO.6.17	And I will receive you.”
2CO.6.18	“I 
2CO.6.18	And you shall be My 
2CO.6.18	Says the 
2CO.7.1	Therefore,
2CO.7.2	Open 
2CO.7.3	I do not say 
2CO.7.4	Great 
2CO.7.5	For indeed, 
2CO.7.6	Nevertheless 
2CO.7.7	and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.
2CO.7.8	For even if I made you 
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. 
2CO.7.10	For 
2CO.7.11	For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, 
2CO.7.12	Therefore, although I wrote to you, 
2CO.7.13	Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit 
2CO.7.14	For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true. 
2CO.7.15	And his affections are greater for you as he remembers 
2CO.7.16	Therefore I rejoice that 
2CO.8.1	Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: 
2CO.8.2	that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and 
2CO.8.3	For I bear witness that according to 
2CO.8.4	imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and 
2CO.8.5	And not 
2CO.8.6	So 
2CO.8.7	But as 
2CO.8.8	I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. 
2CO.8.9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
2CO.8.10	And in this 
2CO.8.11	but now you also must complete the doing 
2CO.8.12	For 
2CO.8.13	For 
2CO.8.14	but by an equality, 
2CO.8.15	As it is written, 
2CO.8.16	But thanks 
2CO.8.17	For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord. 
2CO.8.18	And we have sent with him 
2CO.8.19	and not only 
2CO.8.20	avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us— 
2CO.8.21	providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
2CO.8.22	And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which 
2CO.8.23	If 
2CO.8.24	Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our 
2CO.9.1	Now concerning 
2CO.9.2	for I know your willingness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a 
2CO.9.3	Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready; 
2CO.9.4	lest if 
2CO.9.5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which 
2CO.9.6	But this 
2CO.9.8	And God 
2CO.9.9	As it is written:
2CO.9.9	“He has dispersed abroad,
2CO.9.9	He has given to the poor;
2CO.9.9	His righteousness endures forever.”
2CO.9.10	Now may He who 
2CO.9.11	while 
2CO.9.12	For the administration of this service not only 
2CO.9.13	while, through the proof of this ministry, they 
2CO.9.14	and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding 
2CO.9.15	Thanks 
2CO.10.1	Now 
2CO.10.2	But I beg you 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. 
2CO.10.4	For the weapons 
2CO.10.5	casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 
2CO.10.6	and being ready to punish all disobedience when 
2CO.10.7	Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? 
2CO.10.8	For even if I should boast somewhat more 
2CO.10.9	lest I seem to terrify you by letters. 
2CO.10.10	“For 
2CO.10.11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such 
2CO.10.12	For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 
2CO.10.13	We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us—a sphere which especially includes you. 
2CO.10.14	For we are not overextending ourselves (as though 
2CO.10.15	not boasting of things beyond measure, 
2CO.10.16	to preach the gospel in the 
2CO.10.17	But 
2CO.10.18	For 
2CO.11.1	Oh, that you would bear with me in a little 
2CO.11.2	For I am 
2CO.11.3	But I fear, lest somehow, as 
2CO.11.4	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or 
2CO.11.5	For I consider that 
2CO.11.6	Even though 
2CO.11.7	Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches, taking wages 
2CO.11.9	And when I was present with you, and in need, 
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, 
2CO.11.11	Why? 
2CO.11.12	But what I do, I will also continue to do, 
2CO.11.13	For such 
2CO.11.14	And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into 
2CO.11.15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, 
2CO.11.16	I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	What I speak, 
2CO.11.18	Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast. 
2CO.11.19	For you put up with fools gladly, 
2CO.11.20	For you put up with it 
2CO.11.21	To 
2CO.11.22	Are they 
2CO.11.23	Are they ministers of Christ?—I speak as a fool—I 
2CO.11.24	From the Jews five times I received 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was 
2CO.11.26	 journeys often, 
2CO.11.27	in weariness and toil, 
2CO.11.28	besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn 
2CO.11.30	If I must boast, 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me; 
2CO.11.33	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands.
2CO.12.1	It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to 
2CO.12.2	I know a man 
2CO.12.3	And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— 
2CO.12.4	how he was caught up into 
2CO.12.5	Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not 
2CO.12.6	For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me 
2CO.12.7	And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a 
2CO.12.8	Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 
2CO.12.9	And He said to me, 
2CO.12.10	Therefore 
2CO.12.11	I have become 
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and 
2CO.12.13	For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!
2CO.12.14	Now 
2CO.12.15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent 
2CO.12.16	But be that 
2CO.12.17	Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? 
2CO.12.18	I urged Titus, and sent our 
2CO.12.19	Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? 
2CO.12.20	For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and 
2CO.12.21	lest, when I come again, my God 
2CO.13.1	This 
2CO.13.2	I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those 
2CO.13.3	since you seek a proof of Christ 
2CO.13.4	For though He was crucified in weakness, yet 
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves 
2CO.13.6	But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.
2CO.13.7	Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you should do what is honorable, though 
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	For we are glad 
2CO.13.10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the 
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. 
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2CO.13.13	All the saints greet you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and 
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but 
GAL.1.2	and all the brethren who are with me,
GAL.1.2	To the churches of Galatia:
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
GAL.1.4	who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us 
GAL.1.5	to whom 
GAL.1.6	I marvel that you are turning away so soon 
GAL.1.7	which is not another; but there are some 
GAL.1.8	But even if 
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you 
GAL.1.10	For 
GAL.1.11	But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. 
GAL.1.12	For 
GAL.1.13	For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how 
GAL.1.14	And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, 
GAL.1.15	But when it pleased God, 
GAL.1.16	to reveal His Son in me, that 
GAL.1.17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those 
GAL.1.18	Then after three years 
GAL.1.19	But 
GAL.1.20	(Now 
GAL.1.21	Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which 
GAL.1.23	But they were 
GAL.1.24	And they 
GAL.2.1	Then after fourteen years 
GAL.2.2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but 
GAL.2.3	Yet not even Titus who 
GAL.2.4	And 
GAL.2.5	to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that 
GAL.2.6	But from those 
GAL.2.7	But on the contrary, 
GAL.2.8	(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the 
GAL.2.9	and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be 
GAL.2.11	Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; 
GAL.2.12	for before certain men came from James, 
GAL.2.13	And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about 
GAL.2.15	We 
GAL.2.16	knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but 
GAL.2.17	“But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found 
GAL.2.18	For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 
GAL.2.19	For I 
GAL.2.20	I have been 
GAL.2.21	I do not set aside the grace of God; for 
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? 
GAL.3.2	This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? 
GAL.3.4	Have you suffered so many things in vain—if indeed 
GAL.3.5	Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, 
GAL.3.6	just as Abraham 
GAL.3.7	Therefore know that 
GAL.3.8	And 
GAL.3.9	So then those who 
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, 
GAL.3.11	But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God 
GAL.3.12	Yet 
GAL.3.13	Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, 
GAL.3.14	that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the 
GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: 
GAL.3.16	Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as of many, but as of 
GAL.3.17	And this I say, 
GAL.3.18	For if 
GAL.3.19	What purpose then 
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator does not 
GAL.3.21	 the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. 
GAL.3.22	But the Scripture has confined 
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. 
GAL.3.24	Therefore 
GAL.3.25	But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
GAL.3.26	For you 
GAL.3.27	For 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, 
GAL.3.29	And 
GAL.4.1	Now I say 
GAL.4.2	but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. 
GAL.4.3	Even so we, when we were children, 
GAL.4.4	But 
GAL.4.5	to redeem those who were under the law, 
GAL.4.6	And because you are sons, God has sent forth 
GAL.4.7	Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, 
GAL.4.8	But then, indeed, 
GAL.4.9	But now 
GAL.4.10	You observe days and months and seasons and years. 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid for you, 
GAL.4.12	Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I 
GAL.4.13	You know that 
GAL.4.14	And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me 
GAL.4.15	What then was the blessing you 
GAL.4.16	Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They 
GAL.4.18	But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. 
GAL.4.19	My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, 
GAL.4.20	I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? 
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons: 
GAL.4.23	But he 
GAL.4.24	which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount 
GAL.4.25	for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children— 
GAL.4.26	but the 
GAL.4.27	For it is written:
GAL.4.27	“Rejoice, O barren,
GAL.4.27	 who do not bear!
GAL.4.27	Break forth and shout,
GAL.4.27	You who are not in labor!
GAL.4.27	For the desolate has many more children
GAL.4.27	Than she who has a husband.”
GAL.4.28	Now 
GAL.4.29	But, as 
GAL.4.30	Nevertheless what does 
GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.
GAL.5.1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a 
GAL.5.2	Indeed I, Paul, say to you that 
GAL.5.3	And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised 
GAL.5.4	You have become estranged from Christ, you who 
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit eagerly 
GAL.5.6	For 
GAL.5.7	You 
GAL.5.8	This persuasion does not 
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.
GAL.5.11	And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, 
GAL.5.12	I could wish that those 
GAL.5.13	For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only 
GAL.5.14	For 
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!
GAL.5.16	I say then: 
GAL.5.17	For 
GAL.5.18	But 
GAL.5.19	Now 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 
GAL.5.21	envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told 
GAL.5.22	But 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, self-control. 
GAL.5.24	And those 
GAL.5.25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who 
GAL.6.2	Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill 
GAL.6.3	For 
GAL.6.4	But 
GAL.6.5	For 
GAL.6.6	Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for 
GAL.6.8	For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap 
GAL.6.9	And 
GAL.6.10	Therefore, as we have opportunity, 
GAL.6.11	See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! 
GAL.6.12	As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these 
GAL.6.13	For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 
GAL.6.14	But God forbid that I should boast except in the 
GAL.6.15	For 
GAL.6.16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy 
GAL.6.17	From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
GAL.6.18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
EPH.1.1	To the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Blessed 
EPH.1.4	just as 
EPH.1.5	having predestined us to 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of the glory of His grace, 
EPH.1.7	In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to 
EPH.1.8	which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 
EPH.1.9	having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure 
EPH.1.10	that in the dispensation of 
EPH.1.11	In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to 
EPH.1.12	that we 
EPH.1.13	In Him you also 
EPH.1.14	who is the guarantee of our inheritance 
EPH.1.15	Therefore I also, 
EPH.1.16	do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: 
EPH.1.17	that 
EPH.1.18	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is 
EPH.1.19	and what 
EPH.1.20	which He worked in Christ when 
EPH.1.21	far above all 
EPH.1.22	And 
EPH.1.23	which is His body, 
EPH.2.1	And 
EPH.2.2	in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to 
EPH.2.3	among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in 
EPH.2.4	But God, 
EPH.2.5	even when we were dead in trespasses, 
EPH.2.6	and raised 
EPH.2.7	that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in 
EPH.2.8	For by grace you have been saved 
EPH.2.9	not of 
EPH.2.10	For we are 
EPH.2.11	Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh—who are called Uncircumcision by what is called 
EPH.2.12	that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
EPH.2.14	For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, 
EPH.2.15	having abolished in His flesh the enmity, 
EPH.2.16	and that He might 
EPH.2.17	And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. 
EPH.2.18	For 
EPH.2.19	Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 
EPH.2.20	having been 
EPH.2.21	in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into 
EPH.2.22	in whom you also are being built together for a 
EPH.3.1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles— 
EPH.3.2	if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God 
EPH.3.3	how that by revelation 
EPH.3.4	by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ), 
EPH.3.5	which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: 
EPH.3.6	that the Gentiles 
EPH.3.7	of which I became a minister 
EPH.3.8	To me, 
EPH.3.9	and to make all see what 
EPH.3.10	to the intent that now 
EPH.3.11	according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and access 
EPH.3.13	Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, 
EPH.3.14	For this reason I bow my knees to the 
EPH.3.15	from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
EPH.3.16	that He would grant you, 
EPH.3.17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, 
EPH.3.18	may be able to comprehend with all the saints 
EPH.3.19	to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled 
EPH.3.20	Now 
EPH.3.21	to Him 
EPH.4.1	I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to 
EPH.4.2	with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love, 
EPH.4.3	endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who 
EPH.4.7	But 
EPH.4.8	Therefore He says:
EPH.4.8	“When He ascended on high,
EPH.4.8	He led captivity captive,
EPH.4.8	And gave gifts to men.”
EPH.4.9	(Now this, “He ascended”—what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth? 
EPH.4.10	He who descended is also the One 
EPH.4.11	And He Himself gave some 
EPH.4.12	for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, 
EPH.4.13	till we all come to the unity of the faith 
EPH.4.14	that we should no longer be 
EPH.4.15	but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the 
EPH.4.16	from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.
EPH.4.17	This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should 
EPH.4.18	having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the 
EPH.4.19	who, being past feeling, 
EPH.4.20	But you have not so learned Christ, 
EPH.4.21	if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: 
EPH.4.22	that you 
EPH.4.23	and 
EPH.4.24	and that you 
EPH.4.25	Therefore, putting away lying, 
EPH.4.26	“Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath, 
EPH.4.27	nor give place to the devil. 
EPH.4.28	Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather 
EPH.4.29	Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but 
EPH.4.30	And 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and 
EPH.4.32	And 
EPH.5.1	Therefore
EPH.5.2	And 
EPH.5.3	But fornication and all 
EPH.5.4	neither filthiness, nor 
EPH.5.5	For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any 
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Therefore do not be 
EPH.5.8	For you were once darkness, but now 
EPH.5.9	(for 
EPH.5.10	finding out what is acceptable to the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	And have 
EPH.5.12	For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But 
EPH.5.14	Therefore He says:
EPH.5.14	“Awake, you who sleep,
EPH.5.14	Arise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	And Christ will give you light.”
EPH.5.15	See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	redeeming the time, 
EPH.5.17	Therefore do not be unwise, but 
EPH.5.18	And 
EPH.5.19	speaking to one another 
EPH.5.20	giving thanks always for all things to God the Father 
EPH.5.21	submitting to one another in the fear of God.
EPH.5.22	Wives, 
EPH.5.23	For 
EPH.5.24	Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and 
EPH.5.26	that He might sanctify and cleanse her 
EPH.5.27	that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, 
EPH.5.28	So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord 
EPH.5.30	For 
EPH.5.31	“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the 
EPH.5.32	This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless 
EPH.6.1	Children, 
EPH.6.2	“Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with promise: 
EPH.6.3	“that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.”
EPH.6.4	And 
EPH.6.5	Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, 
EPH.6.6	not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 
EPH.6.7	with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether 
EPH.6.9	And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own 
EPH.6.10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against 
EPH.6.13	Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand 
EPH.6.14	Stand therefore, 
EPH.6.15	and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
EPH.6.16	above all, taking 
EPH.6.17	And 
EPH.6.18	praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, 
EPH.6.19	and for me, that utterance may be given to me, 
EPH.6.20	for which 
EPH.6.21	But that you also may know my affairs 
EPH.6.22	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our affairs, and 
EPH.6.23	Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.6.24	Grace 
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ,
PHP.1.1	To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and 
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
PHP.1.4	always in 
PHP.1.5	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, 
PHP.1.6	being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun 
PHP.1.7	just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, 
PHP.1.10	that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, 
PHP.1.11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness 
PHP.1.12	But I want you to know, brethren, that the things 
PHP.1.13	so that it has become evident 
PHP.1.14	and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: 
PHP.1.16	The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; 
PHP.1.17	but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. 
PHP.1.18	What then? Only 
PHP.1.19	For I know that 
PHP.1.20	according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but 
PHP.1.21	For to me, to live 
PHP.1.22	But if 
PHP.1.23	For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a 
PHP.1.24	Nevertheless to remain in the flesh 
PHP.1.25	And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith, 
PHP.1.26	that 
PHP.1.27	Only 
PHP.1.28	and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God. 
PHP.1.29	For to you 
PHP.1.30	having the same conflict 
PHP.2.1	Therefore if 
PHP.2.2	fulfill my joy 
PHP.2.3	 nothing 
PHP.2.4	Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of 
PHP.2.5	Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, 
PHP.2.6	who, 
PHP.2.7	but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form 
PHP.2.8	And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and 
PHP.2.9	Therefore God also 
PHP.2.10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 
PHP.2.11	and 
PHP.2.12	Therefore, my beloved, 
PHP.2.13	for 
PHP.2.14	Do all things 
PHP.2.15	that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as 
PHP.2.16	holding fast the word of life, so that 
PHP.2.17	Yes, and if 
PHP.2.18	For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send 
PHP.2.20	For I have no one 
PHP.2.21	For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.2.22	But you know his proven character, 
PHP.2.23	Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me. 
PHP.2.24	But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.
PHP.2.25	Yet I considered it necessary to send to you 
PHP.2.26	since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. 
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful. 
PHP.2.29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem; 
PHP.2.30	because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, 
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, 
PHP.3.2	Beware of dogs, beware of 
PHP.3.3	For we are 
PHP.3.4	though 
PHP.3.5	circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, 
PHP.3.6	concerning zeal, 
PHP.3.7	But 
PHP.3.8	Yet indeed I also count all things loss 
PHP.3.9	and be found in Him, not having 
PHP.3.10	that I may know Him and the 
PHP.3.11	if, by any means, I may 
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already 
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing 
PHP.3.14	I press toward the goal for the prize of 
PHP.3.15	Therefore let us, as many as are 
PHP.3.16	Nevertheless, to 
PHP.3.17	Brethren, 
PHP.3.18	For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, 
PHP.3.19	whose end 
PHP.3.20	For 
PHP.3.21	who will transform our lowly body that it may be 
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my beloved and 
PHP.4.2	I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche 
PHP.4.3	And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who 
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!
PHP.4.5	Let your gentleness be known to all men. 
PHP.4.6	Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with 
PHP.4.7	and 
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatever things are 
PHP.4.9	The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and 
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last 
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, 
PHP.4.12	I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things 
PHP.4.14	Nevertheless you have done well that 
PHP.4.15	Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, 
PHP.4.16	For even in Thessalonica you sent 
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek the gift, but I seek 
PHP.4.18	Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from 
PHP.4.19	And my God 
PHP.4.20	Now to our God and Father 
PHP.4.21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren 
PHP.4.22	All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar’s household.
PHP.4.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
COL.1.1	Paul, 
COL.1.2	To the saints 
COL.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
COL.1.3	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
COL.1.4	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of 
COL.1.5	because of the hope 
COL.1.6	which has come to you, 
COL.1.7	as you also learned from 
COL.1.8	who also declared to us your 
COL.1.9	For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask 
COL.1.10	that you may walk worthy of the Lord, 
COL.1.11	strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, 
COL.1.12	giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of 
COL.1.13	He has delivered us from 
COL.1.14	in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.
COL.1.15	He is 
COL.1.16	For 
COL.1.17	And He is before all things, and in Him 
COL.1.18	And 
COL.1.19	For it pleased 
COL.1.20	and 
COL.1.21	And you, 
COL.1.22	in the body of His flesh through death, 
COL.1.23	if indeed you continue 
COL.1.24	I now rejoice in my sufferings 
COL.1.25	of which I became a minister according to 
COL.1.26	the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, 
COL.1.27	To them God willed to make known what are 
COL.1.28	Him we preach, 
COL.1.29	To this 
COL.2.1	For I want you to know what a great 
COL.2.2	that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and 
COL.2.3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
COL.2.4	Now this I say 
COL.2.5	For 
COL.2.6	As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, 
COL.2.7	rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.
COL.2.8	Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to 
COL.2.9	For 
COL.2.10	and you are complete in Him, who is the 
COL.2.11	In Him you were also 
COL.2.12	buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with 
COL.2.13	And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses, 
COL.2.14	having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	Having disarmed 
COL.2.16	So let no one 
COL.2.17	which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ. 
COL.2.18	Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in 
COL.2.19	and not holding fast to 
COL.2.20	Therefore, if you 
COL.2.21	“Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,” 
COL.2.22	which all concern things which perish with the using—
COL.2.23	These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, 
COL.3.1	If then you were 
COL.3.2	Set your mind on things above, not on things on the 
COL.3.3	For you died, 
COL.3.4	When Christ 
COL.3.5	Therefore put to death 
COL.3.6	Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon 
COL.3.7	in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.
COL.3.8	But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, 
COL.3.10	and have put on the new 
COL.3.11	where there is neither 
COL.3.12	Therefore, 
COL.3.13	bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also 
COL.3.14	But above all these things 
COL.3.15	And let 
COL.3.16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another 
COL.3.17	And 
COL.3.18	Wives, submit to your own husbands, 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be 
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.
COL.3.22	Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. 
COL.3.23	And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, 
COL.3.24	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; 
COL.3.25	But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and 
COL.4.1	Masters,
COL.4.2	Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it 
COL.4.3	meanwhile praying also for us, that God would 
COL.4.4	that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.5	Walk in 
COL.4.6	 your speech always 
COL.4.7	Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me. 
COL.4.8	I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, 
COL.4.9	with 
COL.4.10	Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with 
COL.4.11	and Jesus who is called Justus. These 
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is 
COL.4.13	For I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Luke the beloved physician and 
COL.4.15	Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and 
COL.4.16	Now when 
COL.4.17	And say to 
COL.4.18	This salutation by my own hand—Paul. 
1TH.1.1	Paul, 
1TH.1.1	To the church of the 
1TH.1.1	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, 
1TH.1.3	remembering without ceasing 
1TH.1.4	knowing, beloved brethren, 
1TH.1.5	For 
1TH.1.6	And 
1TH.1.7	so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe. 
1TH.1.8	For from you the word of the Lord 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves declare concerning us 
1TH.1.10	and 
1TH.2.1	For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain. 
1TH.2.2	But even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at 
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation 
1TH.2.4	But as 
1TH.2.5	For 
1TH.2.6	Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, when 
1TH.2.7	But 
1TH.2.8	So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased 
1TH.2.9	For you remember, brethren, our 
1TH.2.10	You 
1TH.2.11	as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father 
1TH.2.12	that you would walk worthy of God 
1TH.2.13	For this reason we also thank God 
1TH.2.14	For you, brethren, became imitators 
1TH.2.15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and 
1TH.2.16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always 
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time 
1TH.2.18	Therefore we wanted to come to you—even I, Paul, time and again—but 
1TH.2.19	For 
1TH.2.20	For you are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.1	Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone, 
1TH.3.2	and sent 
1TH.3.3	that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that 
1TH.3.4	For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation, just as it happened, and you know. 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, 
1TH.3.6	But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, 
1TH.3.7	therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress 
1TH.3.8	For now we live, if you 
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God, 
1TH.3.10	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face 
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.3.12	And may the Lord make you increase and 
1TH.3.13	so that He may establish 
1TH.4.1	Finally then, brethren, we urge and exhort in the Lord Jesus 
1TH.4.2	for you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	For this is 
1TH.4.4	that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 
1TH.4.5	not in passion of lust, 
1TH.4.6	that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord 
1TH.4.7	For God did not call us to uncleanness, 
1TH.4.8	Therefore he who rejects 
1TH.4.9	But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for 
1TH.4.10	and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, 
1TH.4.11	that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, 
1TH.4.12	that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and 
1TH.4.13	But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow 
1TH.4.14	For 
1TH.4.15	For this we say to you 
1TH.4.16	For 
1TH.4.17	Then we who are alive 
1TH.4.18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	But concerning 
1TH.5.2	For you yourselves know perfectly that 
1TH.5.3	For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then 
1TH.5.4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. 
1TH.5.5	You are all 
1TH.5.6	Therefore let us not sleep, as others 
1TH.5.7	For 
1TH.5.8	But let us who are of the day be sober, 
1TH.5.9	For 
1TH.5.10	who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.
1TH.5.11	Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.
1TH.5.12	And we urge you, brethren, 
1TH.5.13	and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. 
1TH.5.14	Now we exhort you, brethren, 
1TH.5.15	See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always 
1TH.5.16	Rejoice always, 
1TH.5.17	pray without ceasing, 
1TH.5.18	in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
1TH.5.19	Do not quench the Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Do not despise prophecies. 
1TH.5.21	Test all things; 
1TH.5.22	Abstain from every form of evil.
1TH.5.23	Now may 
1TH.5.24	He who calls you 
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
2TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,
2TH.1.1	To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other, 
2TH.1.4	so that 
2TH.1.6	since 
2TH.1.7	and to 
2TH.1.8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.1.9	These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and 
2TH.1.10	when He comes, in that Day, 
2TH.1.11	Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would 
2TH.1.12	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Now, brethren, 
2TH.2.2	not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. 
2TH.2.3	Let no one deceive you by any means; for 
2TH.2.4	who opposes and 
2TH.2.5	Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. 
2TH.2.7	For 
2TH.2.8	And then the lawless one will be revealed, 
2TH.2.9	The coming of the 
2TH.2.10	and with all unrighteous deception among 
2TH.2.11	And 
2TH.2.12	that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but 
2TH.2.13	But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God 
2TH.2.14	to which He called you by our gospel, for 
2TH.2.15	Therefore, brethren, 
2TH.2.16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, 
2TH.2.17	comfort your hearts 
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, 
2TH.3.2	and 
2TH.3.3	But 
2TH.3.4	And 
2TH.3.5	Now may 
2TH.3.6	But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you; 
2TH.3.8	nor did we eat anyone’s bread free of charge, but worked with 
2TH.3.9	not because we do not have 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. 
2TH.3.11	For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are 
2TH.3.12	Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ 
2TH.3.13	But 
2TH.3.14	And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and 
2TH.3.15	Yet do not count 
2TH.3.16	Now may 
2TH.3.17	The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write.
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,
1TI.1.2	To Timothy, a 
1TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, 
1TI.1.3	As I urged you 
1TI.1.4	nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. 
1TI.1.5	Now 
1TI.1.6	from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to 
1TI.1.7	desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law 
1TI.1.9	knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for 
1TI.1.10	for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 
1TI.1.11	according to the glorious gospel of the 
1TI.1.12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has 
1TI.1.13	although 
1TI.1.14	And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, 
1TI.1.15	This 
1TI.1.16	However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. 
1TI.1.17	Now to 
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, 
1TI.1.19	having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, 
1TI.1.20	of whom are 
1TI.2.1	Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, 
1TI.2.2	for kings and 
1TI.2.3	For this 
1TI.2.4	who desires all men to be saved 
1TI.2.5	For 
1TI.2.6	who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, 
1TI.2.7	for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am speaking the truth in Christ 
1TI.2.8	I desire therefore that the men pray 
1TI.2.9	in like manner also, that the 
1TI.2.10	but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works. 
1TI.2.11	Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. 
1TI.2.12	And 
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. 
1TI.2.15	Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
1TI.3.1	This 
1TI.3.2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; 
1TI.3.3	not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; 
1TI.3.4	one who rules his own house well, having 
1TI.3.5	(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); 
1TI.3.6	not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the 
1TI.3.7	Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the 
1TI.3.8	Likewise deacons 
1TI.3.9	holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 
1TI.3.10	But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being 
1TI.3.11	Likewise, 
1TI.3.12	Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling 
1TI.3.13	For those who have served well as deacons 
1TI.3.14	These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; 
1TI.3.15	but if I am delayed, 
1TI.3.16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
1TI.3.16	God was manifested in the flesh,
1TI.3.16	Justified in the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	Seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	Preached among the Gentiles,
1TI.3.16	Believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	Received up in glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed 
1TI.4.2	speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience 
1TI.4.3	forbidding to marry, 
1TI.4.4	For every creature of God 
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, 
1TI.4.7	But 
1TI.4.8	For 
1TI.4.9	This 
1TI.4.10	For to this 
1TI.4.11	These things command and teach.
1TI.4.12	Let no one despise your youth, but be an 
1TI.4.13	Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy 
1TI.4.15	Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. 
1TI.4.16	Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
1TI.5.1	Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort 
1TI.5.2	older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honor widows who are really widows. 
1TI.5.4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and 
1TI.5.5	Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers 
1TI.5.6	But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. 
1TI.5.7	And these things command, that they may be blameless. 
1TI.5.8	But if anyone does not provide for his own, 
1TI.5.9	Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, 
1TI.5.10	well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
1TI.5.11	But refuse 
1TI.5.12	having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith. 
1TI.5.13	And besides they learn 
1TI.5.14	Therefore I desire that 
1TI.5.15	For some have already turned aside after Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows.
1TI.5.17	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. 
1TI.5.18	For the Scripture says, 
1TI.5.19	Do not receive an accusation against an elder except 
1TI.5.20	Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.
1TI.5.21	I charge 
1TI.5.22	Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor 
1TI.5.23	No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.
1TI.5.24	Some men’s sins are 
1TI.5.25	Likewise, the good works 
1TI.6.1	Let as many 
1TI.6.2	And those who have believing masters, let them not despise 
1TI.6.3	If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to 
1TI.6.4	he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, 
1TI.6.5	useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a 
1TI.6.6	Now godliness with 
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into 
1TI.6.8	And having food and clothing, with these we shall be 
1TI.6.9	But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root of all 
1TI.6.11	But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and 
1TI.6.14	that you keep 
1TI.6.15	which He will manifest in His own time, 
1TI.6.16	who alone has immortality, dwelling in 
1TI.6.17	Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain 
1TI.6.19	storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy! 
1TI.6.21	by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith.
1TI.6.21	Grace 
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the 
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, a 
2TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, 
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as 
2TI.1.4	greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy, 
2TI.1.5	when I call to remembrance 
2TI.1.6	Therefore I remind you 
2TI.1.7	For 
2TI.1.8	Therefore do not be ashamed of 
2TI.1.9	who has saved us and called 
2TI.1.10	but 
2TI.1.11	to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
2TI.1.12	For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, 
2TI.1.13	Hold fast 
2TI.1.14	That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
2TI.1.15	This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	The Lord grant mercy to the 
2TI.1.17	but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found 
2TI.1.18	The Lord 
2TI.2.1	You therefore, 
2TI.2.2	And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	You therefore must 
2TI.2.4	No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of 
2TI.2.5	And also 
2TI.2.6	The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say, and may the Lord 
2TI.2.8	Remember that Jesus Christ, 
2TI.2.9	for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, 
2TI.2.10	Therefore 
2TI.2.11	For 
2TI.2.11	We shall also live with 
2TI.2.12	If we endure,
2TI.2.12	We shall also reign with 
2TI.2.12	If we deny 
2TI.2.12	He also will deny us.
2TI.2.13	If we are faithless,
2TI.2.13	He remains faithful;
2TI.2.13	He 
2TI.2.14	Remind 
2TI.2.15	Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	But shun profane 
2TI.2.17	And their message will spread like cancer. 
2TI.2.18	who have strayed concerning the truth, 
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless 
2TI.2.20	But in a great house there are not only 
2TI.2.21	Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, 
2TI.2.22	Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 
2TI.2.24	And 
2TI.2.25	in humility correcting those who are in opposition, 
2TI.2.26	and 
2TI.3.1	But know this, that 
2TI.3.2	For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 
2TI.3.4	traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
2TI.3.5	having a form of godliness but 
2TI.3.6	For 
2TI.3.7	always learning and never able 
2TI.3.8	Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: 
2TI.3.9	but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, 
2TI.3.10	But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 
2TI.3.11	persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me 
2TI.3.12	Yes, and 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But you must 
2TI.3.15	and that from childhood you have known 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture 
2TI.3.17	that the man of God may be complete, 
2TI.4.1	I 
2TI.4.2	Preach the word! Be ready in season 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure 
2TI.4.4	and they will turn 
2TI.4.5	But you be watchful in all things, 
2TI.4.6	For 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	Finally, there is laid up for me 
2TI.4.9	Be diligent to come to me quickly; 
2TI.4.10	for 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Get 
2TI.4.12	And 
2TI.4.13	Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come—and the books, especially the parchments.
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. 
2TI.4.15	You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.
2TI.4.16	At my first defense no one stood with me, but all forsook me. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, 
2TI.4.18	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve 
2TI.4.19	Greet 
2TI.4.20	Erastus stayed in Corinth, but 
2TI.4.21	Do your utmost to come before winter.
2TI.4.21	Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.
2TI.4.22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and 
TIT.1.2	in hope of eternal life which God, who 
TIT.1.3	but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;
TIT.1.4	To 
TIT.1.4	Grace, mercy, 
TIT.1.5	For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should 
TIT.1.6	if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, 
TIT.1.7	For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, 
TIT.1.8	but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, 
TIT.1.9	holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict.
TIT.1.10	For there are many insubordinate, both idle 
TIT.1.11	whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not, 
TIT.1.12	One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true. 
TIT.1.14	not giving heed to Jewish fables and 
TIT.1.15	To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled. 
TIT.1.16	They profess to 
TIT.2.1	But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: 
TIT.2.2	that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; 
TIT.2.3	the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things— 
TIT.2.4	that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.6	Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 
TIT.2.7	in all things showing yourself 
TIT.2.8	sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.
TIT.2.10	not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
TIT.2.11	For 
TIT.2.12	teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, 
TIT.2.13	looking for the blessed 
TIT.2.14	who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed 
TIT.2.15	Speak these things, 
TIT.3.1	Remind them 
TIT.3.2	to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men. 
TIT.3.3	For 
TIT.3.4	But when 
TIT.3.5	not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through 
TIT.3.6	whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
TIT.3.7	that having been justified by His grace 
TIT.3.8	This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
TIT.3.9	But 
TIT.3.10	Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition, 
TIT.3.11	knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned.
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas to you, or 
TIT.3.13	Send Zenas the lawyer and 
TIT.3.14	And let our 
TIT.3.15	All who 
TIT.3.15	Grace 
PHM.1.1	Paul, a 
PHM.1.1	To Philemon our beloved 
PHM.1.2	to the beloved Apphia, 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, 
PHM.1.6	that the sharing of your faith may become effective 
PHM.1.7	For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
PHM.1.8	Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, 
PHM.1.9	 for love’s sake I rather appeal 
PHM.1.10	I appeal to you for my son 
PHM.1.11	who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me.
PHM.1.12	I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, 
PHM.1.13	whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. 
PHM.1.14	But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, 
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he departed for a while for this 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave but more than a slave—a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the 
PHM.1.17	If then you count me as a partner, receive him as 
PHM.1.18	But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, am writing with my own 
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 
PHM.1.22	But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for 
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
HEB.1.1	God, who at various times and 
HEB.1.2	has in these last days spoken to us by 
HEB.1.3	who being the brightness of 
HEB.1.4	having become so much better than the angels, as 
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did He ever say:
HEB.1.5	“You are My Son,
HEB.1.5	Today I have begotten You”?
HEB.1.5	And again:
HEB.1.5	“I will be to Him a Father,
HEB.1.5	And He shall be to Me a Son”?
HEB.1.6	But when He again brings 
HEB.1.6	“Let all the angels of God worship Him.”
HEB.1.7	And of the angels He says:
HEB.1.7	“Who makes His angels spirits
HEB.1.7	And His ministers a flame of fire.”
HEB.1.8	But to the Son 
HEB.1.8	“Your throne, O God, 
HEB.1.8	A scepter of righteousness 
HEB.1.9	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;
HEB.1.9	Therefore God, Your God, 
HEB.1.9	With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.”
HEB.1.10	And:
HEB.1.10	“You, 
HEB.1.10	And the heavens are the work of Your hands.
HEB.1.11	They will perish, but You remain;
HEB.1.11	And 
HEB.1.12	Like a cloak You will fold them up,
HEB.1.12	And they will be changed.
HEB.1.12	But You are the 
HEB.1.12	And Your years will not fail.”
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels has He ever said:
HEB.1.13	“Sit at My right hand,
HEB.1.13	Till I make Your enemies Your footstool”?
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will 
HEB.2.1	Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. 
HEB.2.2	For if the word 
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, 
HEB.2.4	God also bearing witness 
HEB.2.5	For He has not put 
HEB.2.6	But one testified in a certain place, saying:
HEB.2.6	“What is man that You are mindful of him,
HEB.2.6	Or the son of man that You take care of him?
HEB.2.7	You have made him a little lower than the angels;
HEB.2.7	You have crowned him with glory and honor,
HEB.2.7	And set him over the works of Your hands.
HEB.2.8	You have put all things in subjection under his feet.”
HEB.2.8	For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing 
HEB.2.9	But we see Jesus, 
HEB.2.10	For it was fitting for Him, 
HEB.2.11	For 
HEB.2.12	saying:
HEB.2.12	“I will declare Your name to My brethren;
HEB.2.12	In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.”
HEB.2.13	And again:
HEB.2.13	“I will put My trust in Him.”
HEB.2.13	And again:
HEB.2.13	“Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.”
HEB.2.14	Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He 
HEB.2.15	and release those who 
HEB.2.16	For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore, in all things He had 
HEB.2.18	For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus, 
HEB.3.2	who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as 
HEB.3.3	For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but 
HEB.3.5	And Moses indeed 
HEB.3.6	but Christ as 
HEB.3.7	Therefore, as 
HEB.3.7	“Today, if you will hear His voice,
HEB.3.8	Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
HEB.3.8	In the day of trial in the wilderness,
HEB.3.9	Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me,
HEB.3.9	And saw My works forty years.
HEB.3.10	Therefore I was angry with that generation,
HEB.3.10	And said, ‘They always go astray in 
HEB.3.10	And they have not known My ways.’
HEB.3.11	So I swore in My wrath,
HEB.3.11	‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ”
HEB.3.12	Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; 
HEB.3.13	but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
HEB.3.14	For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, 
HEB.3.15	while it is said:
HEB.3.15	“Today, if you will hear His voice,
HEB.3.15	Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
HEB.3.16	For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, 
HEB.3.17	Now with whom was He angry forty years? 
HEB.3.18	And 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they could not enter in because of 
HEB.4.1	Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, 
HEB.4.2	For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard 
HEB.4.3	For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said:
HEB.4.3	“So I swore in My wrath,
HEB.4.3	‘They shall not enter My rest,’ ”
HEB.4.3	although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh 
HEB.4.5	and again in this 
HEB.4.6	Since therefore it remains that some 
HEB.4.7	again He designates a certain day, saying in David, “Today,” after such a long time, as it has been said:
HEB.4.7	“Today, if you will hear His voice,
HEB.4.7	Do not harden your hearts.”
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had 
HEB.4.9	There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God 
HEB.4.11	Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God 
HEB.4.13	And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things 
HEB.4.14	Seeing then that we have a great 
HEB.4.15	For 
HEB.4.16	Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest taken from among men 
HEB.5.2	He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to 
HEB.5.3	Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for 
HEB.5.4	And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as 
HEB.5.5	So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but 
HEB.5.5	“You are My Son,
HEB.5.5	Today I have begotten You.”
HEB.5.6	As 
HEB.5.6	“You 
HEB.5.6	According to the order of Melchizedek”;
HEB.5.7	who, in the days of His flesh, when He had 
HEB.5.8	though He was a Son, 
HEB.5.9	And 
HEB.5.10	called by God as High Priest 
HEB.5.11	of whom 
HEB.5.12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need 
HEB.5.13	For everyone who partakes 
HEB.5.14	But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, 
HEB.6.1	Therefore, 
HEB.6.2	of the doctrine of baptisms, 
HEB.6.3	And this we will do if God permits.
HEB.6.4	For 
HEB.6.5	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, 
HEB.6.6	if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, 
HEB.6.7	For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, 
HEB.6.8	but if it bears thorns and briers, 
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, yes, things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this manner. 
HEB.6.10	For 
HEB.6.11	And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence 
HEB.6.12	that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience 
HEB.6.13	For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, 
HEB.6.14	saying, 
HEB.6.15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the 
HEB.6.16	For men indeed swear by the greater, and 
HEB.6.17	Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to 
HEB.6.18	that by two immutable things, in which it 
HEB.6.19	This 
HEB.6.20	where the forerunner has entered for us, 
HEB.7.1	For this 
HEB.7.2	to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,” 
HEB.7.3	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man 
HEB.7.5	And indeed 
HEB.7.6	but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham 
HEB.7.7	Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better. 
HEB.7.8	Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he 
HEB.7.9	Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak, 
HEB.7.10	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
HEB.7.11	Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need 
HEB.7.12	For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. 
HEB.7.13	For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has officiated at the altar.
HEB.7.14	For 
HEB.7.15	And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest 
HEB.7.16	who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. 
HEB.7.17	For He testifies:
HEB.7.17	“You 
HEB.7.17	According to the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.7.18	For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of 
HEB.7.19	for 
HEB.7.20	And inasmuch as 
HEB.7.21	(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him:
HEB.7.21	“The 
HEB.7.21	And will not relent,
HEB.7.21	‘You 
HEB.7.21	According to the order of Melchizedek’ ”),
HEB.7.22	by so much more Jesus has become a surety of a 
HEB.7.23	Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. 
HEB.7.24	But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. 
HEB.7.25	Therefore He is also 
HEB.7.26	For such a High Priest was fitting for us, 
HEB.7.27	who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His 
HEB.7.28	For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, 
HEB.8.1	Now 
HEB.8.2	a Minister of 
HEB.8.3	For 
HEB.8.4	For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; 
HEB.8.5	who serve 
HEB.8.6	But now 
HEB.8.7	For if that 
HEB.8.8	Because finding fault with them, He says: 
HEB.8.9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the 
HEB.8.10	For this 
HEB.8.11	None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, ‘Know the 
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, 
HEB.8.13	In that He says, “A new 
HEB.9.1	Then indeed, even the first 
HEB.9.2	For a tabernacle was prepared: the first 
HEB.9.3	and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All, 
HEB.9.4	which had the 
HEB.9.5	and 
HEB.9.6	Now when these things had been thus prepared, 
HEB.9.7	But into the second part the high priest 
HEB.9.8	the Holy Spirit indicating this, that 
HEB.9.9	It 
HEB.9.10	 only with 
HEB.9.11	But Christ came 
HEB.9.12	Not 
HEB.9.13	For if 
HEB.9.14	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, 
HEB.9.15	And for this reason 
HEB.9.16	For where there 
HEB.9.17	For 
HEB.9.18	Therefore not even the first 
HEB.9.19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, 
HEB.9.20	saying, 
HEB.9.21	Then likewise 
HEB.9.22	And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and 
HEB.9.23	Therefore 
HEB.9.24	For 
HEB.9.25	not that He should offer Himself often, as 
HEB.9.26	He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. 
HEB.9.27	And as it is appointed for men to die once, 
HEB.9.28	so 
HEB.10.1	For the law, having a 
HEB.10.2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins. 
HEB.10.3	But in those 
HEB.10.4	For 
HEB.10.5	Therefore, when He came into the world, He said:
HEB.10.5	“Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,
HEB.10.5	But a body You have prepared for Me.
HEB.10.6	In burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.6	You had no pleasure.
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come—
HEB.10.7	In the volume of the book it is written of Me—
HEB.10.7	To do Your will, O God.’ ”
HEB.10.8	Previously saying, “Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and 
HEB.10.9	then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second. 
HEB.10.10	By that will we have been sanctified 
HEB.10.11	And every priest stands 
HEB.10.12	But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down 
HEB.10.13	from that time waiting 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
HEB.10.15	But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,
HEB.10.16	“This 
HEB.10.18	Now where there is remission of these, 
HEB.10.19	Therefore, brethren, having 
HEB.10.20	by a new and 
HEB.10.21	and 
HEB.10.22	let us 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the confession of 
HEB.10.24	And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 
HEB.10.25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as 
HEB.10.26	For 
HEB.10.27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who has rejected Moses’ law dies without mercy on 
HEB.10.29	Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, 
HEB.10.30	For we know Him who said, 
HEB.10.31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	But 
HEB.10.33	partly while you were made 
HEB.10.34	for you had compassion on me 
HEB.10.35	Therefore do not cast away your confidence, 
HEB.10.36	For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, 
HEB.10.37	“For 
HEB.10.38	Now 
HEB.10.38	But if 
HEB.10.38	My soul has no pleasure in him.”
HEB.10.39	But we are not of those 
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence 
HEB.11.2	For by it the elders obtained a 
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that 
HEB.11.4	By faith 
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, 
HEB.11.6	But without faith 
HEB.11.7	By faith 
HEB.11.8	By faith 
HEB.11.9	By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as 
HEB.11.10	for he waited for 
HEB.11.11	By faith 
HEB.11.12	Therefore from one man, and him as good as 
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, 
HEB.11.14	For those who say such things 
HEB.11.15	And truly if they had called to mind 
HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly 
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, 
HEB.11.18	of whom it was said, 
HEB.11.19	concluding that God 
HEB.11.20	By faith 
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, when he was dying, 
HEB.11.22	By faith 
HEB.11.23	By faith 
HEB.11.24	By faith 
HEB.11.25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 
HEB.11.26	esteeming 
HEB.11.27	By faith 
HEB.11.28	By faith 
HEB.11.29	By faith 
HEB.11.30	By faith 
HEB.11.31	By faith 
HEB.11.32	And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of 
HEB.11.33	who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, 
HEB.11.34	quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead raised to life again.
HEB.11.35	Others were 
HEB.11.36	Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. 
HEB.11.38	of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, 
HEB.11.39	And all these, 
HEB.11.40	God having provided something better for us, that they should not be 
HEB.12.1	Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, 
HEB.12.2	looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of 
HEB.12.3	For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, 
HEB.12.4	You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin. 
HEB.12.5	And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons:
HEB.12.5	“My son, do not despise the chastening of the 
HEB.12.5	Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;
HEB.12.6	For 
HEB.12.6	And scourges every son whom He receives.”
HEB.12.7	If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what 
HEB.12.8	But if you are without chastening, 
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected 
HEB.12.10	For they indeed for a few days chastened 
HEB.12.11	Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields 
HEB.12.12	Therefore 
HEB.12.13	and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.
HEB.12.14	Pursue peace with all 
HEB.12.15	looking carefully lest anyone 
HEB.12.16	lest there 
HEB.12.17	For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was 
HEB.12.18	For you have not come to 
HEB.12.19	and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard 
HEB.12.20	(For they could not endure what was commanded: 
HEB.12.21	And so terrifying was the sight 
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, 
HEB.12.23	to the general assembly and church of 
HEB.12.24	to Jesus 
HEB.12.25	See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For 
HEB.12.26	whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, 
HEB.12.27	Now this, “Yet once more,” indicates the 
HEB.12.28	Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may 
HEB.12.29	For 
HEB.13.1	Let 
HEB.13.2	Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so 
HEB.13.3	Remember the prisoners as if chained with them—those who are mistreated—since you yourselves are in the body also.
HEB.13.4	Marriage 
HEB.13.6	So we may boldly say:
HEB.13.6	“The 
HEB.13.6	I will not fear.
HEB.13.6	What can man do to me?”
HEB.13.7	Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ 
HEB.13.9	Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. 
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp. 
HEB.13.12	Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate. 
HEB.13.13	Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing 
HEB.13.14	For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. 
HEB.13.15	Therefore by Him let us continually offer 
HEB.13.16	But do not forget to do good and to share, for 
HEB.13.17	Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for 
HEB.13.18	Pray for us; for we are confident that we have 
HEB.13.19	But I especially urge 
HEB.13.20	Now may 
HEB.13.21	make you complete in every good work to do His will, 
HEB.13.22	And I appeal to you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words. 
HEB.13.23	Know that 
HEB.13.24	Greet all those who rule over you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
HEB.13.25	Grace 
JAS.1.1	James, 
JAS.1.1	To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad:
JAS.1.1	Greetings.
JAS.1.2	My brethren, 
JAS.1.3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 
JAS.1.4	But let patience have 
JAS.1.5	If any of you lacks wisdom, 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 
JAS.1.9	Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, 
JAS.1.10	but the rich in his humiliation, because 
JAS.1.11	For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.
JAS.1.12	Blessed 
JAS.1.13	Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 
JAS.1.14	But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 
JAS.1.15	Then, 
JAS.1.16	Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. 
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, 
JAS.1.18	Of His own will He brought us forth by the 
JAS.1.19	So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, 
JAS.1.20	for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
JAS.1.21	Therefore 
JAS.1.22	But 
JAS.1.23	For 
JAS.1.24	for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 
JAS.1.25	But 
JAS.1.26	If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and 
JAS.1.27	Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: 
JAS.2.1	My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
JAS.2.2	For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes, 
JAS.2.3	and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, “You sit here in a good place,” and say to the poor man, “You stand there,” or, “Sit here at my footstool,” 
JAS.2.4	have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
JAS.2.5	Listen, my beloved brethren: 
JAS.2.6	But 
JAS.2.7	Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are 
JAS.2.8	If you really fulfill 
JAS.2.9	but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as 
JAS.2.10	For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet 
JAS.2.11	For He who said, 
JAS.2.12	So speak and so do as those who will be judged by 
JAS.2.13	For 
JAS.2.14	What 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 
JAS.2.16	and 
JAS.2.17	Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
JAS.2.18	But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” 
JAS.2.19	You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! 
JAS.2.20	But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? 
JAS.2.21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works 
JAS.2.22	Do you see 
JAS.2.23	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 
JAS.2.24	You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.
JAS.2.25	Likewise, 
JAS.2.26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
JAS.3.1	My brethren, 
JAS.3.2	For 
JAS.3.3	Indeed, 
JAS.3.4	Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. 
JAS.3.5	Even so 
JAS.3.5	See how great a forest a little fire kindles! 
JAS.3.6	And 
JAS.3.7	For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 
JAS.3.8	But no man can tame the tongue. 
JAS.3.9	With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made 
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. 
JAS.3.11	Does a spring send forth fresh 
JAS.3.12	Can a 
JAS.3.13	Who 
JAS.3.14	But if you have 
JAS.3.15	This wisdom does not descend from above, but 
JAS.3.16	For 
JAS.3.17	But 
JAS.3.18	Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
JAS.4.1	Where do wars and fights 
JAS.4.2	You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask. 
JAS.4.3	You ask and do not receive, 
JAS.4.4	Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that 
JAS.4.5	Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, 
JAS.4.6	But He gives more grace. Therefore He says:
JAS.4.6	“God resists the proud,
JAS.4.6	But gives grace to the humble.”
JAS.4.7	Therefore submit to God. 
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. 
JAS.4.9	Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.
JAS.4.11	Do not speak evil of one another, brethren. He who speaks evil of a brother 
JAS.4.12	There is one Lawgiver, 
JAS.4.13	Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”; 
JAS.4.14	whereas you do not know what 
JAS.4.15	Instead you 
JAS.4.16	But now you boast in your arrogance. 
JAS.4.17	Therefore, 
JAS.5.1	Come now, 
JAS.5.2	Your 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. 
JAS.5.4	Indeed 
JAS.5.5	You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you.
JAS.5.7	Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See 
JAS.5.8	You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
JAS.5.9	Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door! 
JAS.5.10	My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and 
JAS.5.11	Indeed 
JAS.5.12	But above all, my brethren, 
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you suffering? Let him 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, 
JAS.5.15	And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. 
JAS.5.16	Confess 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man 
JAS.5.18	And he prayed 
JAS.5.19	Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone 
JAS.5.20	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way 
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
1PE.1.1	To the pilgrims 
1PE.1.2	elect 
1PE.1.2	Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
1PE.1.3	Blessed 
1PE.1.4	to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, 
1PE.1.5	who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1PE.1.6	In this you greatly rejoice, though now 
1PE.1.7	that 
1PE.1.8	whom having not seen you love. 
1PE.1.9	receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of 
1PE.1.10	Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace 
1PE.1.11	searching what, or what manner of time, 
1PE.1.12	To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which 
1PE.1.13	Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest 
1PE.1.14	as obedient children, not 
1PE.1.15	but as He who called you 
1PE.1.16	because it is written, 
1PE.1.17	And if you call on the Father, who 
1PE.1.18	knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, 
1PE.1.19	but 
1PE.1.20	He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest 
1PE.1.21	who through Him believe in God, 
1PE.1.22	Since you 
1PE.1.23	having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, 
1PE.1.24	because
1PE.1.24	“All flesh 
1PE.1.24	And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass.
1PE.1.24	The grass withers,
1PE.1.24	And its flower falls away,
1PE.1.25	But the word of the 
1PE.1.25	Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.
1PE.2.1	Therefore, 
1PE.2.2	as newborn babes, desire the pure 
1PE.2.3	if indeed you have 
1PE.2.4	Coming to Him 
1PE.2.5	you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture,
1PE.2.6	“Behold, I lay in Zion
1PE.2.6	A chief cornerstone, elect, precious,
1PE.2.6	And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.”
1PE.2.7	Therefore, to you who believe, 
1PE.2.7	“The stone which the builders rejected
1PE.2.7	Has become the chief cornerstone,”
1PE.2.8	and
1PE.2.8	“A stone of stumbling
1PE.2.8	And a rock of offense.”
1PE.2.8	They stumble, being disobedient to the word, 
1PE.2.9	But you 
1PE.2.10	who once 
1PE.2.11	Beloved, I beg 
1PE.2.12	having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, 
1PE.2.13	Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king as supreme, 
1PE.2.14	or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and 
1PE.2.15	For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men— 
1PE.2.16	as free, yet not 
1PE.2.17	Honor all 
1PE.2.18	Servants, 
1PE.2.19	For this 
1PE.2.20	For 
1PE.2.21	For 
1PE.2.22	“Who 
1PE.2.22	Nor was deceit found in His mouth”; 
1PE.2.23	who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but 
1PE.2.24	who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, 
1PE.2.25	For 
1PE.3.1	Wives, likewise, 
1PE.3.2	when they observe your chaste conduct 
1PE.3.3	Do not let your adornment be 
1PE.3.4	rather 
1PE.3.5	For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, 
1PE.3.6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, 
1PE.3.7	Husbands, likewise, dwell with 
1PE.3.8	Finally, all 
1PE.3.9	not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary 
1PE.3.10	For
1PE.3.10	“He who would love life
1PE.3.10	And see good days,
1PE.3.10	Let him refrain his tongue from evil,
1PE.3.10	And his lips from speaking deceit.
1PE.3.11	Let him 
1PE.3.11	Let him seek peace and pursue it.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the 
1PE.3.12	And His ears 
1PE.3.12	But the face of the 
1PE.3.13	And who 
1PE.3.14	But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, 
1PE.3.15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always 
1PE.3.16	having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. 
1PE.3.17	For 
1PE.3.18	For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, 
1PE.3.19	by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison, 
1PE.3.20	who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while 
1PE.3.21	There is also an antitype which now saves us—baptism 
1PE.3.22	who has gone into heaven and 
1PE.4.1	Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 
1PE.4.2	that he no longer should live the rest of 
1PE.4.3	For we 
1PE.4.4	In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with 
1PE.4.5	They will give an account to Him who is ready 
1PE.4.6	For this reason 
1PE.4.7	But 
1PE.4.8	And above all things have fervent love for one another, for 
1PE.4.9	 hospitable to one another 
1PE.4.10	As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, 
1PE.4.11	If anyone speaks, 
1PE.4.12	Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; 
1PE.4.13	but rejoice 
1PE.4.14	If you are reproached for the name of Christ, 
1PE.4.15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. 
1PE.4.16	Yet if 
1PE.4.17	For the time 
1PE.4.18	Now
1PE.4.18	“If the righteous one is scarcely saved,
1PE.4.18	Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?”
1PE.4.19	Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God 
1PE.5.1	The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a 
1PE.5.2	Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, 
1PE.5.3	nor as 
1PE.5.4	and when 
1PE.5.5	Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to 
1PE.5.5	“God resists the proud,
1PE.5.5	But 
1PE.5.6	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, 
1PE.5.7	casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
1PE.5.8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 
1PE.5.9	Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. 
1PE.5.10	But may the God of all grace, 
1PE.5.11	To Him 
1PE.5.12	By 
1PE.5.13	She who is in Babylon, elect together with 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.
1PE.5.14	Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a bondservant and 
2PE.1.1	To those who have obtained 
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 
2PE.1.3	as His 
2PE.1.4	by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be 
2PE.1.5	But also for this very reason, 
2PE.1.6	to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness, 
2PE.1.7	to godliness brotherly kindness, and 
2PE.1.8	For if these things are yours and abound, 
2PE.1.9	For he who lacks these things is 
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent 
2PE.1.11	for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	For this reason 
2PE.1.13	Yes, I think it is right, 
2PE.1.14	knowing that shortly I 
2PE.1.15	Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my decease.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow 
2PE.1.17	For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: 
2PE.1.18	And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on 
2PE.1.19	And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a 
2PE.1.20	knowing this first, that 
2PE.1.21	for 
2PE.2.1	But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be 
2PE.2.2	And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. 
2PE.2.3	By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.
2PE.2.4	For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast 
2PE.2.5	and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, 
2PE.2.6	and turning the cities of 
2PE.2.7	and 
2PE.2.8	(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, 
2PE.2.10	and especially 
2PE.2.11	whereas 
2PE.2.12	But these, 
2PE.2.13	 will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure 
2PE.2.14	having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. 
2PE.2.15	They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of 
2PE.2.16	but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.
2PE.2.17	These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.
2PE.2.18	For when they speak great swelling 
2PE.2.19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; 
2PE.2.20	For if, after they 
2PE.2.21	For 
2PE.2.22	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: 
2PE.3.1	Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in 
2PE.3.2	that you may be mindful of the words 
2PE.3.3	knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, 
2PE.3.4	and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as 
2PE.3.5	For this they willfully forget: that 
2PE.3.6	by which the world 
2PE.3.7	But 
2PE.3.8	But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day 
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slack concerning 
2PE.3.10	But 
2PE.3.11	Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner 
2PE.3.12	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will 
2PE.3.13	Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for 
2PE.3.14	Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent 
2PE.3.15	and consider 
2PE.3.16	as also in all his 
2PE.3.17	You therefore, beloved, 
2PE.3.18	but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.3.18	To Him 
1JN.1.1	That 
1JN.1.2	the life 
1JN.1.3	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship 
1JN.1.4	And these things we write to you 
1JN.1.5	This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that 
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 
1JN.1.7	But if we 
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we 
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we 
1JN.2.1	My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, 
1JN.2.2	And 
1JN.2.3	Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. 
1JN.2.4	He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a 
1JN.2.5	But 
1JN.2.6	He who says he abides in Him 
1JN.2.7	Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had 
1JN.2.8	Again, 
1JN.2.9	He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now. 
1JN.2.10	He who loves his brother abides in the light, and 
1JN.2.11	But he who 
1JN.2.12	I write to you, little children,
1JN.2.12	Because 
1JN.2.13	I write to you, fathers,
1JN.2.13	Because you have known Him 
1JN.2.13	I write to you, young men,
1JN.2.13	Because you have overcome the wicked one.
1JN.2.13	I write to you, little children,
1JN.2.13	Because you have 
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, fathers,
1JN.2.14	Because you have known Him 
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, young men,
1JN.2.14	Because 
1JN.2.14	And you have overcome the wicked one.
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world or the things in the world. 
1JN.2.16	For all that 
1JN.2.17	And 
1JN.2.18	Little children, 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for 
1JN.2.20	But 
1JN.2.21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
1JN.2.22	Who is a liar but he who denies that 
1JN.2.23	Whoever denies the Son does not have the 
1JN.2.24	Therefore let that abide in you 
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise that He has promised us—eternal life.
1JN.2.26	These things I have written to you concerning those who 
1JN.2.27	But the 
1JN.2.28	And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have 
1JN.2.29	If you know that He is righteous, you know that 
1JN.3.1	Behold 
1JN.3.2	Beloved, 
1JN.3.3	And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
1JN.3.4	Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and 
1JN.3.5	And you know 
1JN.3.6	Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, 
1JN.3.9	Whoever has been 
1JN.3.10	In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor 
1JN.3.11	For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, 
1JN.3.12	not as 
1JN.3.13	Do not marvel, my brethren, if 
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love 
1JN.3.15	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that 
1JN.3.16	By this we know love, 
1JN.3.17	But 
1JN.3.18	My little children, 
1JN.3.19	And by this we know 
1JN.3.20	For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, 
1JN.3.22	And 
1JN.3.23	And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ 
1JN.3.24	Now 
1JN.4.1	Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but 
1JN.4.2	By this you know the Spirit of God: 
1JN.4.3	and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the 
1JN.4.4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than 
1JN.4.5	They are of the world. Therefore they speak 
1JN.4.6	We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. 
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who 
1JN.4.8	He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten 
1JN.4.10	In this is love, 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, 
1JN.4.12	No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us. 
1JN.4.13	By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	And 
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 
1JN.4.16	And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and 
1JN.4.17	Love has been perfected among us in this: that 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. 
1JN.4.19	We love Him because He first loved us.
1JN.4.20	If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God 
1JN.4.21	And 
1JN.5.1	Whoever believes that 
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and 
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And 
1JN.5.4	For 
1JN.5.5	Who is he who overcomes the world, but 
1JN.5.6	This is He who came 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, 
1JN.5.8	And there are three that bear witness on earth: 
1JN.5.9	If we receive 
1JN.5.10	He who believes in the Son of God 
1JN.5.11	And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 
1JN.5.12	He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. 
1JN.5.13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may 
1JN.5.14	Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.
1JN.5.16	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not 
1JN.5.18	We know that 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are of God, and 
1JN.5.20	And we know that the 
1JN.5.21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
2JN.1.1	The Elder,
2JN.1.1	To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known 
2JN.1.2	because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, 
2JN.1.4	I 
2JN.1.5	And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: 
2JN.1.6	This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that 
2JN.1.7	For 
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, 
2JN.1.9	Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and 
2JN.1.11	for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	Having many things to write to you, I did not wish 
2JN.1.13	The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
3JN.1.1	The Elder,
3JN.1.1	To the beloved Gaius, 
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. 
3JN.1.3	For I 
3JN.1.4	I have no greater 
3JN.1.5	Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers, 
3JN.1.6	who have borne witness of your love before the church. 
3JN.1.7	because they went forth for His name’s sake, 
3JN.1.8	We therefore ought to 
3JN.1.9	I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. 
3JN.1.10	Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, 
3JN.1.11	Beloved, 
3JN.1.12	Demetrius 
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; 
3JN.1.14	but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face.
3JN.1.14	Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
JUD.1.1	Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and 
JUD.1.1	To those who are 
JUD.1.2	Mercy, 
JUD.1.3	Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you 
JUD.1.4	For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.5	But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that 
JUD.1.6	And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; 
JUD.1.7	as 
JUD.1.8	Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and 
JUD.1.9	Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, 
JUD.1.10	But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. 
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! For they have gone in the way 
JUD.1.12	These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; 
JUD.1.13	raging waves of the sea, 
JUD.1.14	Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, 
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the 
JUD.1.16	These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they 
JUD.1.17	But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
JUD.1.18	how they told you that 
JUD.1.19	These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.
JUD.1.20	But you, beloved, 
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God, 
JUD.1.22	And on some have compassion, making a distinction; 
JUD.1.23	but 
JUD.1.24	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
JUD.1.24	And 
JUD.1.24	Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,
JUD.1.25	To God our Savior,
JUD.1.25	Who alone is wise,
JUD.1.25	Be glory and majesty,
JUD.1.25	Dominion and power,
JUD.1.25	Both now and forever.
JUD.1.25	Amen.
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, 
REV.1.2	who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things 
REV.1.3	Blessed 
REV.1.4	John, to the seven churches which are in Asia:
REV.1.4	Grace to you and peace from Him 
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ, 
REV.1.5	To Him 
REV.1.6	and has 
REV.1.7	Behold, He is coming with 
REV.1.8	 says the Lord, 
REV.1.9	I, John, both your brother and 
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit on 
REV.1.11	saying, 
REV.1.12	Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned 
REV.1.13	and in the midst of the seven lampstands 
REV.1.14	His head and 
REV.1.15	His feet 
REV.1.16	He had in His right hand seven stars, 
REV.1.17	And 
REV.4.1	After these things I looked, and behold, a door 
REV.4.2	Immediately 
REV.4.3	And He who sat there was 
REV.4.4	Around the throne 
REV.4.5	And from the throne proceeded 
REV.4.6	Before the throne 
REV.4.7	The first living creature 
REV.4.8	 four living creatures, each having 
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy,
REV.4.8	Lord God Almighty,
REV.4.8	Who was and is and is to come!”
REV.4.9	Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
REV.4.11	“You
REV.4.11	To receive glory and honor and power;
REV.4.11	For You created all things,
REV.4.11	And by 
REV.5.1	And I saw in the right 
REV.5.2	Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 
REV.5.3	And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it.
REV.5.4	So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. 
REV.5.5	But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, 
REV.5.6	And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood 
REV.5.7	Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand 
REV.5.8	Now when He had taken the scroll, 
REV.5.9	And 
REV.5.9	“You are worthy to take the scroll,
REV.5.9	And to open its seals;
REV.5.9	For You were slain,
REV.5.9	And 
REV.5.9	Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
REV.5.10	And have made us 
REV.5.10	And we shall reign on the earth.”
REV.5.11	Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, 
REV.5.12	saying with a loud voice:
REV.5.12	“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
REV.5.12	To receive power and riches and wisdom,
REV.5.12	And strength and honor and glory and blessing!”
REV.5.13	And 
REV.5.13	“Blessing and honor and glory and power
REV.5.13	 to Him 
REV.5.13	And to the Lamb, forever and ever!”
REV.5.14	Then the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever.
REV.6.1	Now 
REV.6.2	And I looked, and behold, 
REV.6.3	When He opened the second seal, 
REV.6.4	Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to 
REV.6.5	When He opened the third seal, 
REV.6.6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and 
REV.6.7	When He opened the fourth seal, 
REV.6.8	So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, 
REV.6.9	When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under 
REV.6.10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 
REV.6.11	Then a 
REV.6.12	I looked when He opened the sixth seal, 
REV.6.13	And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. 
REV.6.14	Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and 
REV.6.15	And the 
REV.6.16	and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who 
REV.6.17	For the great day of His wrath has come, 
REV.7.1	After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, 
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, 
REV.7.3	saying, 
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of those who were sealed. 
REV.7.5	of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand 
REV.7.5	of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand 
REV.7.5	of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand 
REV.7.6	of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand 
REV.7.6	of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand 
REV.7.6	of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand 
REV.7.7	of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand 
REV.7.7	of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand 
REV.7.7	of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand 
REV.7.8	of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand 
REV.7.8	of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand 
REV.7.8	of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand 
REV.7.9	After these things I looked, and behold, 
REV.7.10	and crying out with a loud voice, saying, 
REV.7.11	All the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and 
REV.7.12	saying:
REV.7.12	“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom,
REV.7.12	Thanksgiving and honor and power and might,
REV.7.12	 to our God forever and ever.
REV.7.12	Amen.”
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these arrayed in 
REV.7.14	And I said to him, “Sir, you know.”
REV.7.14	So he said to me, 
REV.7.15	Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will 
REV.7.16	They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; 
REV.7.17	for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne 
REV.8.1	When
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, 
REV.8.3	Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer 
REV.8.4	And 
REV.8.5	Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw 
REV.8.6	So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
REV.8.7	The first angel sounded: 
REV.8.8	Then the second angel sounded: 
REV.8.9	And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	Then the third angel sounded: 
REV.8.11	The name of the star is Wormwood. 
REV.8.12	Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.
REV.8.13	And I looked, 
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel sounded: 
REV.9.2	And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the 
REV.9.3	Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, 
REV.9.4	They were commanded 
REV.9.5	And they were not given 
REV.9.6	In those days 
REV.9.7	The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. 
REV.9.8	They had hair like women’s hair, and 
REV.9.9	And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings 
REV.9.10	They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power 
REV.9.11	And they had as king over them 
REV.9.12	One woe is past. Behold, still two more woes are coming after these things.
REV.9.13	Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the 
REV.9.14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound 
REV.9.15	So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a 
REV.9.16	Now 
REV.9.17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; 
REV.9.18	By these three 
REV.9.19	For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; 
REV.9.20	But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, 
REV.9.21	And they did not repent of their murders 
REV.10.1	I saw still another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. 
REV.10.2	He had a little book open in his hand. 
REV.10.3	and cried with a loud voice, as 
REV.10.4	Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, 
REV.10.5	The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land 
REV.10.6	and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, 
REV.10.7	but 
REV.10.8	Then the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.”
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel and said to him, “Give me the little book.”
REV.10.9	And he said to me, 
REV.10.10	Then I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, 
REV.10.11	And he said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.”
REV.11.1	Then I was given 
REV.11.2	But leave out 
REV.11.3	And I will give 
REV.11.4	These are the 
REV.11.5	And if anyone wants to harm them, 
REV.11.6	These 
REV.11.7	When they 
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies 
REV.11.9	Then 
REV.11.10	And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make merry, 
REV.11.11	Now after the three-and-a-half days 
REV.11.12	And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” 
REV.11.13	In the same hour 
REV.11.14	The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
REV.11.15	Then 
REV.11.16	And 
REV.11.17	saying:
REV.11.17	“We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty,
REV.11.17	The One 
REV.11.17	Because You have taken Your great power 
REV.11.18	The nations were 
REV.11.18	And the time of the 
REV.11.18	And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints,
REV.11.18	And those who fear Your name, small and great,
REV.11.18	And should destroy those who destroy the earth.”
REV.11.19	Then 
REV.12.1	Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. 
REV.12.2	Then being with child, she cried out 
REV.12.3	And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, 
REV.12.4	His tail drew a third 
REV.12.5	She bore a male Child 
REV.12.6	Then 
REV.12.7	And war broke out in heaven: 
REV.12.8	but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. 
REV.12.9	So 
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, 
REV.12.11	And 
REV.12.12	Therefore 
REV.12.13	Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted 
REV.12.14	But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, 
REV.12.15	So the serpent 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.13.1	Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw 
REV.13.2	Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like 
REV.13.3	And I saw one of his heads 
REV.13.4	So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, 
REV.13.5	And he was given 
REV.13.6	Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, 
REV.13.7	It was granted to him 
REV.13.8	All who dwell on the earth will worship him, 
REV.13.9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 
REV.13.10	He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; 
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast 
REV.13.12	And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, 
REV.13.13	He performs great signs, 
REV.13.14	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth 
REV.13.15	He was granted 
REV.13.16	He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, 
REV.13.17	and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let him who has 
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and behold, a 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, 
REV.14.3	They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song 
REV.14.4	These are the ones who were not defiled with women, 
REV.14.5	And 
REV.14.6	Then I saw another angel 
REV.14.7	saying with a loud voice, 
REV.14.8	And another angel followed, saying, 
REV.14.9	Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 
REV.14.10	he himself 
REV.14.11	And 
REV.14.12	Here is the patience of the saints; 
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: 
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Spirit, 
REV.14.14	Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat 
REV.14.15	And another angel 
REV.14.16	So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar, 
REV.14.19	So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw 
REV.14.20	And 
REV.15.1	Then 
REV.15.2	And I saw 
REV.15.3	They sing 
REV.15.3	“Great and marvelous 
REV.15.3	Lord God Almighty!
REV.15.3	Just and true 
REV.15.3	O King of the saints!
REV.15.4	Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name?
REV.15.4	For 
REV.15.4	For 
REV.15.4	For Your judgments have been manifested.”
REV.15.5	After these things I looked, and behold, 
REV.15.6	And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, 
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God 
REV.15.8	The temple was filled with smoke 
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying 
REV.16.2	So the first went and poured out his bowl 
REV.16.3	Then the second angel poured out his bowl 
REV.16.4	Then the third angel poured out his bowl 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying:
REV.16.5	“You are righteous, O Lord,
REV.16.5	The One 
REV.16.5	Because You have judged these things.
REV.16.6	For 
REV.16.6	And You have given them blood to drink.
REV.16.6	For it is their just due.”
REV.16.7	And I heard another from the altar saying, “Even so, 
REV.16.8	Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl 
REV.16.9	And men were scorched with great heat, and they 
REV.16.10	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl 
REV.16.11	They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds.
REV.16.12	Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl 
REV.16.13	And I saw three unclean 
REV.16.14	For they are spirits of demons, 
REV.16.16	And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
REV.16.17	Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, 
REV.16.18	And 
REV.16.19	Now 
REV.16.20	Then 
REV.16.21	And great hail from heaven fell upon men, 
REV.17.1	Then 
REV.17.2	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and 
REV.17.3	So he carried me away in the Spirit 
REV.17.4	The woman 
REV.17.5	And on her forehead a name 
REV.17.5	MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,
REV.17.5	THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS
REV.17.5	AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS
REV.17.5	OF THE EARTH.
REV.17.6	I saw 
REV.17.7	But the angel said to me, “Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 
REV.17.8	The beast that you saw was, and is not, and 
REV.17.9	“Here 
REV.17.10	There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, 
REV.17.11	The 
REV.17.12	“The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast. 
REV.17.13	These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will 
REV.17.15	Then he said to me, 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, 
REV.17.17	For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, 
REV.17.18	And the woman whom you saw 
REV.18.1	After
REV.18.2	And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, 
REV.18.3	For all the nations 
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from heaven saying, 
REV.18.5	For her sins have reached to heaven, and 
REV.18.6	Render to her just as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her works; 
REV.18.7	In the measure that she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit 
REV.18.8	Therefore her plagues will come 
REV.18.9	“The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her 
REV.18.10	standing at a distance for fear of her torment, saying, 
REV.18.11	“And 
REV.18.12	merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble; 
REV.18.13	and cinnamon and incense, fragrant oil and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and 
REV.18.14	The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all. 
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, 
REV.18.16	and saying, ‘Alas, alas, 
REV.18.17	For in one hour such great riches came to nothing.’ 
REV.18.18	and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 
REV.18.19	“They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! 
REV.18.20	“Rejoice over her, O heaven, and 
REV.18.21	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw 
REV.18.22	The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 
REV.18.23	The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, 
REV.18.24	And 
REV.19.1	After these things 
REV.19.2	For 
REV.19.3	Again they said, “Alleluia! 
REV.19.4	And 
REV.19.5	Then a voice came from the throne, saying, 
REV.19.6	And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, “Alleluia! For 
REV.19.7	Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for 
REV.19.8	And 
REV.19.9	Then he said to me, “Write: 
REV.19.10	And 
REV.19.11	Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, 
REV.19.12	His eyes 
REV.19.13	He 
REV.19.14	And the armies in heaven, 
REV.19.15	Now 
REV.19.16	And 
REV.19.16	KING OF KINGS AND
REV.19.16	LORD OF LORDS.
REV.19.17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, 
REV.19.18	that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all 
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army. 
REV.19.20	Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and 
REV.19.21	And the rest 
REV.20.1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, 
REV.20.2	He laid hold of 
REV.20.3	and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and 
REV.20.4	And I saw 
REV.20.5	But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy 
REV.20.7	Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison 
REV.20.8	and will go out 
REV.20.9	They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. 
REV.20.10	The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone 
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, 
REV.20.13	The sea gave up the dead who were in it, 
REV.20.14	Then 
REV.20.15	And anyone not found written in the Book of Life 
REV.21.1	Now 
REV.21.2	Then I, John, saw 
REV.21.3	And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, 
REV.21.4	And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; 
REV.21.5	Then 
REV.21.6	And He said to me, 
REV.21.7	He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and 
REV.21.8	But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in 
REV.21.9	Then one of 
REV.21.10	And he carried me away 
REV.21.11	having the glory of God. Her light 
REV.21.12	Also she had a great and high wall with 
REV.21.13	three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
REV.21.14	Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and 
REV.21.15	And he who talked with me 
REV.21.16	The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal. 
REV.21.17	Then he measured its wall: one hundred 
REV.21.18	The construction of its wall was 
REV.21.19	The foundations of the wall of the city 
REV.21.20	the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. 
REV.21.21	The twelve gates 
REV.21.22	But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb 
REV.21.24	And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it. 
REV.21.25	Its gates shall not be shut at all by day 
REV.21.26	And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 
REV.21.27	But 
REV.22.1	And he showed me 
REV.22.2	In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, 
REV.22.3	And 
REV.22.4	They shall see His face, and 
REV.22.5	There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor 
REV.22.6	Then he said to me, 
REV.22.8	Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, 
REV.22.9	Then he said to me, 
REV.22.10	And he said to me, “Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, 
REV.22.11	He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.”
REV.22.14	Blessed 
REV.22.15	But 
REV.22.17	And the Spirit and 
REV.22.18	For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: 
REV.22.19	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, 
REV.22.20	He who testifies to these things says, 
REV.22.20	Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!
REV.22.21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
